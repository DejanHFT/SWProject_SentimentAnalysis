Stretches to help achieve splits.,NeonboiiZ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/bjcb5z/stretches_to_help_achieve_splits/,2,1,"I'm a male, 22 and I want to be able to do the splits for mobility sake and to also help my kicks when I train Muay Thai. 

Just wondering what stretches or excercises I could implement to help me achieve this? 

I usually stretch my hamstrings, quads, glutes and abductors before working out (weight training) but i was wondering if there was anything else I could do?"
