Have a home gym but 0 motivation for it vs commercial gym. Anyone else experienced this?,Oranos_Rex,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/63ry6a/have_a_home_gym_but_0_motivation_for_it_vs/,55,38,"Since I was a young teen I was lifting weights in my garage with an old, battered set of dumbbells, a small bar and a old bench he had. Eventually I managed to convince my parents to clear everything out of the garage (except the freezer, for pretty obvious reasons) and converted it into a home gym; power rack, bench, barbells, a punch-bag my friend gave me. I even later bought a rowing machine (can't use because of bad shoulders)

Fast forward many years and depression and injury kept me from using it much, and eventually at all; I've since joined a local gym and have enjoyed my workouts there. Yesterday I was in the garage to put some stuff in the freezer and thought ""hey, I've got most the stuff I need here, why not cancel my membership if I just like it here again?"" And so today I went to go lift and....


....I have 0 motivation to lift in the home gym. I don't know if it's the space/how it all looks/the fact that I'm at home, but I'm just not focused when lifting like I used to be. Or, more relevantly, like I am when at the gym. When I'm at the gym I commit myself fully to each lift and end the workout feeling like I made progress; I wasn't even able to get through doing the front squats before apathy and boredom made me stop at home.

Has anyone else ever come across this? I really feel like just selling all the stuff I have as I don't feel like the home gym is relevant any longer."
