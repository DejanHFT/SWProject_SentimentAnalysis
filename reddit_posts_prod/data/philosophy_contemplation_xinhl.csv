"Philosophy - what is, how do, and why?
",slickwombat,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/xinhl/philosophy_what_is_how_do_and_why/,61,14,"Hi all, relatively new to this sub (lurked for awhile, just started posting). In my short time here though, I'm seeing a lot of discussion that is... well... not good philosophy. I'm also seeing some responses (e.g., [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/xiean/how_to_be_a_philosopher/) that suggest some serious misapprehensions about what philosophy is and how it's done. 

So I thought I'd have a little lunch-break rant on that topic, and see if we're all on the same page. Note that this is meant to generate discussion rather than accuse anyone of anything (although it will likely come off as the latter, this being reddit and all).

As with all good philosophy, we start with definitions.

**What is philosophy?**

Just as the lay person commonly misunderstands what science is, many commonly misunderstand what philosophy is. The lay definition is probably something like, ""abstract musings about the mysteries of life, existence, and meaning."" When most people think of scientists, they think of people building contraptions and mucking around with test tubes, which is a partial and misleading view of what scientists actually do. Similarly, when people think of philosophers, they think of bearded hippies staring contemplatively into the clouds and occasionally uttering super deep pronouncements about life and meaning.

While philosophy is not a science (more on that below), it does have a defined meaning, and its practice is highly rigorous. Defined broadly, it is of course ""the love of wisdom"". More specifically, it refers to the use of logic and evidence as a way of answering three Big Questions:

- What can we know? (Epistemology)
- What is there, really? (Metaphysics)
- What should we do? (Axiology, aka moral & ethical theory)

Importantly, in posing these questions as a philosopher would, we must be highly strict in our thinking. It's not enough to pose a philosophical sort of question like ""is there free will?"" or ""does reality exist?"" We have to think first about what the question means, what it presupposes, and therefore what any possible answers are going to mean. 

**How to do philosophy good**

Too often, you see questions or answers that sort of look like this:

""What is existence?""

Sounds philosophy-ish, but the question in this case is so abstract that 10 people might actually assume it means 10 different things. As a result, you're going to get people answering a lot of different questions, and generally end up with an inconclusive, rambling discussion. Because the practice of philosophy requires productive, meaningful debate, the question is a poor one. 

""I think that existence is the combined voice of universal consciousness.""

Sounds deep! But so what? What does it mean? What makes it a reasonable belief to have?

You are of course free to feel or think anything you wish, but that doesn't make it philosophy. As philosophers, what matters is what we can *argue for*. If you think X, provide a rational argument for why one *should* believe X. Expect and appreciate people who disagree in rational ways -- reasoned debate is how philosophy is done, not a personal attack. Expect also people who disagree in silly, meaningless ways, and be patient with them and try to explain yourself better. The key again is that you're going for real logic and evidence, not merely something that seems ""deep"". 

If none of that resonates, consider this overly-general rule of thumb: if something sounds like it might have been said by someone stoned out of their minds and followed by ""whoaaaa"", it's probably not great philosophy. :)

**Rigorous, careful reasoning? Strict definitions? That's just for math and physics. Philosophy isn't science!**

No it isn't science. Philosophy is however the source from which all the sciences arose. How'd that happen?

Science is a very carefully defined methodology for finding things out about the natural world. As you already know, it's extremely powerful. However, it is also extremely *limited*.

Science cannot tell you, for example, about *reality* in an absolute way. We all assume (reasonably!) that if science effectively proves that the earth orbits the sun, then the earth really, actually orbits the sun. But all science really does is form theories based on observations. Are our observations reflections of anything real? Does constant observation actually prove anything? Because gravity has worked a certain way every time it's been measured, does that mean it will work the same way tomorrow? Is science itself a good methodology for dealing with evidence? These are serious *philosophical* questions.

Philosophy is intellectual inquiry limited only by logic, and even logic itself is fair game for inquiry. That makes it less straightforwardly pragmatic than science, but allows it to look at topics that science cannot. This is why it's still relevant, and also why it's so damn cool.

**Who are you to tell me how I should philosophize? How dare you! Downvote for impudence!**

I'm nobody special! I have a BA in Philosophy (from years back) which is hardly massive qualifications. But this is the great thing about philosophy, you don't need to be a PhD to participate. You don't even need to be tremendously well-read (although of course it helps immensely!). All you need to do is use your reasoning faculties to understand ideas, and formulate logical questions and arguments.

Is what I've said here well-reasoned? Maybe not! If you think not, let's hear your arguments."
