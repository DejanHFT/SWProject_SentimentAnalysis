Achievement unlocked?,Ztuart,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/edy7z/achievement_unlocked/,48,8,"I'm really bad at working out regularly, however I love the trophy/achievement system for video games. So I was wondering if you could help me come up with a check list of Bronze/silver/gold achievements, Or a point system. My thoughts would be they would be divided into, Nutrition, Bench Marks, and Consistency. I feel like these are a good place to start
    
Consitency would have things like,Bronze: Goto the gym 3 times one week. Silver: Goto the gym 3 times a week for a month. Gold: go to the gym 3 times a week for 48 out of 52 weeks.

Bench marks would be something like: Bronze: squat XXX Silver: Bench your body weight, Gold: Military press your body weight.

Anyone else feel like this could be a really good way to get into a habit?"
