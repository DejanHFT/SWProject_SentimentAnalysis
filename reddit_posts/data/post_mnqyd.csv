"Reddit, please STOP with the atheist, LGBT BS. You're doing more harm than good!",64bittechie,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/mnqyd/reddit_please_stop_with_the_atheist_lgbt_bs_youre/,199,6,"I've been a Redditor for more than 2 years (my current account is about 2 years old). I've seen this community to be nice and tolerant. But lately the amount of bullshit that gets posted is just driving me nuts.

Atheists attacking religious folks. LGBT posts attacking heterosexuals. WTF is going on here? 

Do you guys have a superiority complex? Just because you're atheists makes you better? Just because you believe in the non-existence of something makes you superior? Just because you think science is going to explain everything one day makes you some how a better human being than someone with faith? Just because someone has faith in a higher power automatically makes them fools? There are plenty of tolerant people who have balanced opinions of BOTH science and faith (I'm not talking about the BS creationist shit thats perpetuated in the media).

The LGBT community keeps harping on the fact that heterosexual couples are irresponsible and LGBT couples are some how better. If you want to be given an equal chance of raising kids, STOP attacking other people and DO something about it.

[When I see posts like these, it simply makes my blood BOIL.](http://www.lowbird.com/data/images/2011/11/the-sad-truth-hello-0fad1c-2913469.jpg) Why? Because NOT every LGBT couple is responsible, great and can provide for kids and similarly NOT every heterosexual couple is irresponsible.

So STOP picking on each other, be tolerant and get the fuck along. By picking on each other you're just creating enemies and hatred towards your own community. Is that what you REALLY want? People to HATE YOU?

I know and I don't say that the whole community is full of morons who spread hatred but the few who do, get upvoted and they make everyone look bad.

**Edit:** Great. Thanks for the downvotes guys. Looks like the number of dumbasses out weight the Redditors I once knew on Reddit."
