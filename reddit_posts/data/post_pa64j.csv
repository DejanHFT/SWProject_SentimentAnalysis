What percentage of human zygotes abort spontaneously before birth?,OtherSideReflections,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/pa64j/what_percentage_of_human_zygotes_abort/,8,11,"That is, what percentage of zygotes terminate naturally at any point between conception and birth? I've read that this statistic is extremely highâ€”[more than two thirds](http://books.google.com/books?id=tBQgMTqIseQC&pg=PA124&dq=%22a+third+of+all+conceptions%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5gAiT6zYD8qhiALT1YzcBw&ved=0CGMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22a%20third%20of%20all%20conceptions%22&f=false), in fact. But I'm not sure if this is accurate, because the statistics seem to vary quite a bit. I've also read that because of how difficult it is to monitor the very early stages of development, it's tough to arrive at a definite figure.

So, what's the most accurate figure based on our current knowledge, and what's the best source (preferably accessible online) to cite on the matter?"
