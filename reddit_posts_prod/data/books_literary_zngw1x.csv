The change in the literary world,soumpontinho,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/zngw1x/the_change_in_the_literary_world/,11,16," In my adolescence (when I had more free time) I did a literary year, those famous ones where you read a book from each country, it was a very famous challenge at the time and many blogs and even here on reddit there were many tips on which books to read, even so it was a very difficult challenge to do, good books were very hard to find mainly because of the language barrier and sometimes reading wasn't worth it.

 I just finished reading “Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows” and started reading “If We Lived in a Normal Place for Juan Pablo Villalobos” and I have on my list ""Babel for R. F. Kuang"" and even though it's not really my style “Tender Is the Flesh for Agustina Bazterrica” has been highly recommended. And I started to think about what it would be like to do a literary challenge right now.

They are all great books by authors of different nationalities, when I was a teenager and I found a book like Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Haruki Murakami that was the culmination of a week or sometimes a month of a lot of research, and they seemed to be almost unique, but now I feel that it is easier to find these amazing books. 

 I know we've always had famous authors of different nationalities (Umberto Eco, Tolstoy, Miguel de Cervantes) I don't deny the quality of their works or the due fame, but they are not easy books to read, and they are placed on a pedestal that makes reading difficult for the average person. (who doesn't really want to study the nuances of writing)

 Perhaps the ease that current technology offers has a role in this, but for me there is really a change in the way the literary industry advertises books and in the quality they deliver, I can see authors that I would never have access to before."
