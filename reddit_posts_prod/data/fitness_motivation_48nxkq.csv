How do you guys working desk jobs stay motivated to be healthy?,Bcider,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/48nxkq/how_do_you_guys_working_desk_jobs_stay_motivated/,175,107,"I honestly feel like I'm just rotting. I have a big deadline coming in the next few weeks so I'm consistently putting in 12 hour workdays and then I have to commute home that usually takes 1.5 hours one way. I still get 3 workouts in a week but beyond that I am too shot to do anything else and it's not like I have the time to do anything else either.

Every time I try to motivate myself to get back on a diet and do cardio again I get super depressed from work and just relapse into eating crap and drinking a few times a week. Drinking is probably my biggest issue as I average around 30 beers a week. It's tough to get up at 6 am, get to work at 8 am and then work until 8 PM, finally getting home around 10 PM. One day of this I can usually handle but by the 2nd or 3rd day in a row of doing this I just say fuck it and drink a beer or two on the train home and then a few more when I get home and go to bed.

I know some people will say the best solution is to quit but I need money right now and the other companies I could go work for immediately would have me be running similar schedules."
