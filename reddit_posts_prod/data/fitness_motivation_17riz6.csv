237 - 182lbs. Couldn't have done it without the help and motivation of this community. Pictures inside. (x-post from /r/progresspics and /r/loseit),HalpBogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/17riz6/237_182lbs_couldnt_have_done_it_without_the_help/,213,821,"Link to pictures: http://i.imgur.com/rr2RE9U.jpg First two pictures were from my first round of Insanity. The progress I made from just those two months really gave me the drive to keep going. I've been lurking /r/fitness and /r/loseit for a while now, and taking every bit of advice I can and applying it to my daily routine. I am currently lifting with a set of adjustable dumbbells at home 3-4 times a week, as well as keeping a reasonable calorie deficit. I am also consuming at least 100g of protein a day. I can't wait to get a six pack in time for summer. Thanks, you guys.
Edit: Some additional information.
I am 6' 1"" I am eating around 1500 calories a day. This includes around 120-130g of Protein. I am doing a wide range of exercises with just a set of dumbbells 3-4 times a week (usually Mon. Wed. Fri. and sometimes Sat). If I'm not tired, I will do pushups and/or pull-ups randomly throughout the day. My thighs are naturally large so I tend to stay away from very heavy squatting.

Edit 2: Wow! I can't believe how many people have responded to this post! I'm flattered by all your compliments and moved by your encouragement!

I've been getting a lot of questions about my daily routine so here goes:

On a typical day, I will consume a cup of dark coffee, 2-4 hardboiled egg whites, an apple,  a half-cup of surimi (fake crab meat), a 4-ounce chicken breast, a half a cup of brown rice, 2/3 cup of mixed vegetables (frozen), 2 scoops of Body Fortress Whey protein mix, a cup of whole or 2% milk, and many glasses of water. I'll usually eat a small turkey sandwich on whole grain bread or drink some more milk if I need to add some calories. Salads with tuna I reserve for workout days, as for my height and weight I allow myself 3 cans per week to steer clear of mercury poisoning. I'll also snack on peanuts or almonds if I need a quick fix. I take a generic multivitamin as well as 3 capsules of fish oil (total of 1000mg) a day.

As for the workout, my days are usually Mon. Wed. and Fri. I'll start with some jumping jacks to get the blood flowing, then go straight into lifting. 4 sets of push-ups, 4 sets of pull-ups (neutral grip), 4 sets of curls, 3 sets of shrugs, 3 sets of flys or benches, 3 sets of rows, 3 sets of sit-ups, 3 sets of squats, and If I still have some energy, do some more push-ups. BTW almost all the lifting I do is with 30-40 pounds of weight.

I can't tell you how happy I am to see the responses from you all. Please keep doing what you are doing, and ask all the questions you need to help better yourself!
