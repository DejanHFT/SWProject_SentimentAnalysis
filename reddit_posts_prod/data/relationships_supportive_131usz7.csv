I ( 25F) want to be a housewife - family not supportive,SunshineSoul7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/131usz7/i_25f_want_to_be_a_housewife_family_not_supportive/,14,0,"Hi everyone, I'm a 25-year-old woman with a bachelor's degree in computer networking. However, my true passion is being a housewife and creating a little project or business in my own home. I know it's not a popular choice these days, but it's something I really want for myself.

The problem is, my family doesn't accept my mindset. My mom and siblings are all career-oriented and they don't understand why I wouldn't want to use my degree to pursue a successful career. It's been a constant struggle to explain my decision to them.

The only person who supports me is my dad, but he doesn't live with us. It's been tough trying to stay true to myself while also dealing with the pressure from my family.

I'm hoping to connect with others who might be going through a similar situation or who can offer some advice on how to deal with family members who don't understand my decision. I know it's not the traditional path, but it's what feels right for me. Thanks for listening.

TL;DR: I'm a 25-year-old woman with a degree in computer networking, but I want to be a housewife and start a home-based business. My family doesn't accept my decision, and I'm looking for advice on how to deal with the pressure and connect with others who can relate."
