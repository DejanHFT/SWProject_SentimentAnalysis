Can learning productivity be increased by watching lectures at double speed?,ConfidentSwing1694,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/s2m4ru/can_learning_productivity_be_increased_by/,8,5,"I found [an article](https://newatlas.com/science/watching-videos-double-speed-learning-study-comprehension/) suggesting that watching videos at 2x speed doesn't hurt study comprehension. 

To me this suggests that school / college productivity can be increased significantly. 

Of course, most of the comprehension happens outside of the lecture hall, but this still seems like a large opportunity."
