"I'm Dr. Mohammed Rasool Qtaishat, an Associate Professor at the Chemical Engineering Department, University of Jordan. My work on desalination using solar energy could make potable water more accessible. AMA!",AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/10mj5by/im_dr_mohammed_rasool_qtaishat_an_associate/,200,6165,"Hello all! My major objectives are technology development and research in water, energy, and environmental resource solutions. I am deeply interested in seawater desalination membrane technologies and have four patents in my name, which I aim to commercialize for the large-scale desalination industry.

In August 2022, my work was featured in [Interesting Engineering](https://interestingengineering.com/science/membrane-desalination-potable-water-seawater?modal-plan) (IE) and made it to the publication's [top 22 innovations](https://interestingengineering.com/science/desalination-technologies-water) of 2022. IE helped organize this AMA session. I'll be on at 1pm ET (18 UT), ask me anything related to all things chemical engineering- or, most specifically, seawater desalination technologies!
