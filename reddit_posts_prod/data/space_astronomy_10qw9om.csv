I want to become an astronomer. How do I start?,tanshersgamingps4,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/10qw9om/i_want_to_become_an_astronomer_how_do_i_start/,148,307,"Iâ€™m 13, and I want to become an Astronomer at NASA or anywhere that pays well. What should I study in grade 7 (there is IGCSE and IB in later grades which I am gonna take so you can suggest courses for that too) How do i prepare to become one? 

Which companies pay well if you are an Astronomer? I only know about NASA and SpaceX right now.

I did a lot of research about astronomy and other fields of profession related to it, but I found astronomy the most interesting.

I am very fascinated by the universe, a lot more than you think a 13 year old would be. I love researching about everything related to the universe.

Side note: Math is not my strong suit"
