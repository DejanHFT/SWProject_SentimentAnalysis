How well does the Lat Pulldown machine translate to the Pull Up?,TimeKeeper2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3oc36s/how_well_does_the_lat_pulldown_machine_translate/,91,74,"Let's assume that I do 4 sets of 10 reps in the Lat Pulldown machine with about 25% bodyweight. After I got good at it, I increased it to 50%, then when I'm great at that I'll increase it to 75% and so on until I do the Lat Pulldown at 100% bodyweight.

Let's just say that I can do 4 sets of 10 reps at the Lat Pulldown machine with 100% bodyweight. If I were to do Pull Ups/Chin Ups the next day, can I do 4 sets of 10 reps at the Pull/Chin Up just as I did 4 sets of 10 at the Lat Pulldowns?"
