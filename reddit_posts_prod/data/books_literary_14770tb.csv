Your fav book YouTubers who do literary analysis/critique?,Asleep_Amphibian_280,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14770tb/your_fav_book_youtubers_who_do_literary/,9,36,"Hi all, looking for some book YouTube channels by book nerds who are into literary criticism and literary analysis, maybe people who are either PhD students or professors or equally as analytically-oriented. I’m especially interested in critical theory, queer theory, etc., so book YouTubers who are into that kind of lit crit would be nice.

I’m trying also to find YouTubers who recommend books that are more dark/serious and/or disturbing, things like Dostoevsky, Camus, de Sade or Sader-Masoch. As far as theory goes I’m really into the Frankfurt school thinkers and those who come after them in a similar tradition, like Foucault or Deleuze or Agamben. 

Any help is super appreciated. Thanks!"
