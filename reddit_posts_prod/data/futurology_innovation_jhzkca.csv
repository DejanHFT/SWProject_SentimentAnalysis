What will be the next food tech innovations?,F-Eric,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/jhzkca/what_will_be_the_next_food_tech_innovations/,1,9,"**What do you think are examples for great technological innovations in the food space?**

**AND where would you place them in the coordinate system?**

In 2016, Eric Schmidt, executive director of Alphabet (Google’s parent company) named meat substitutes as one of six game-changing moonshot technologies.^(\[)[^(1)](https://fortune.com/2016/05/02/eric-schmidts-6-tech-trends/)^(\]) This assumption is reasonable when considering that about 14% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are caused by livestock farming (especially beef and lamb) ^(\[)[^(2)](https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food)^(\]) and we are facing a global population increase of about 2 billion in the next 30 years ^(\[)[^(3)](https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/population/)^(\]) increasing the urgency for “clean” protein sources even further.

This made me wonder: What other innovations can we expect in the food space within the next 5-10 years, including food production, processing, packaging, distribution, preparation, and consumption?

To get started I’ve collected a few interesting technologies and trends and then placed them (more or less arbitrarily) into a **coordinate system** spanning from low-tech\* to high-tech\*\*, and from evolutionary\*\*\* to revolutionary\*\*\*\*.

^(\*Low Tech: Anyone can do it in their home kitchen.)

^(\*\*High Tech: Someone would either need special training and/or special equipment.)

^(\*\*\*Evolutionary: Incremental change (we are doing what we do, but better) .)

^(\*\*\*\*Revolutionary: Radical change (Potential sources for disruptions including emergence of new markets, diminishing existing markets, new technologies, political conditions and regulation, changes in human behavior and attitudes, new business models, paradigm shifts) .)

**Here are some of my examples:**

**1st quadrant:**

* Lab-grown meat: A technology to grow muscle cells that are harvested from animals in an appropriate growth medium. This will not only allow us to consume real meat without killing animals, but also has the potential to completely change the relationship towards meat. We can consider eating endangered species, maybe extinct species, hybrid meats like horse and bird (Pegasus, sort of like a mythical cuisine), or even meat made from our own cells. ***Examples: Mammuty, Bistro In Vitro, ..***
* Vertical farming: Crops are grown in vertical stacked layers. This technology optimizes water usage and reduces the area needed to supply a growing population with food. Farms can enter urban spaces to meet the demand for nutrient-rich and fresh crops. ***Examples: Growing Underground, Square Roots, ..***

**2nd quadrant:**

* Plant-based meat analogues: We have seen more and more plant-based meat imitations that not only look like meat, but imitate meat in their cooking process and eventually even taste like meat. ***Examples: Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat, ..***

**3rd quadrant:**

* Insect proteins: Insects are a highly nutritious and healthy source of food but face great resistance in western cultures due to their unfamiliarity. More and more companies are rolling out snacks utilizing insects as a nutritional boost. ***Examples: Beneto Foods, Bugfarm Foods, ..***

**4th quadrant:**

* Food delivery apps: Having meals or groceries delivered to your door is not only convenient, but changes entire cityscapes. What were traditionally considered undesirable locations in neighborhoods are becoming dispatch centers for dark kitchens and food-delivery businesses. ***Examples: Uber Eats, Blue Apron, Amazon fresh, ..***
* Blockchain technology: Blockchain technology not only allows us to trace the origin of our food in seconds, but also increases transparency of the food chain. ***Examples: IBM Foodtrust, ..***

**\~ Center:**

* Biodegradable packaging: Reducing plastic waste by using biodegradable plastics. Building on the urgent need to reduce synthetic plastic packaging one can make seaweed-based plastics in their home kitchen lab. ***Examples: Notpla, ..***
