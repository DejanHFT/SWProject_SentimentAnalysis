Told my partner to break up with me if he can't financially support me for a year,Superb_Ad_4986,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17238ew/told_my_partner_to_break_up_with_me_if_he_cant/,47,80,"I 19m & my partner 21M are planning on moving overseas for a year because he has compulsory civil service in his home country. We've been living together for about a year and got our relationship legally registered this month. I'm physically disabled and currently receive a pension and have been unable to work but do part-time study and some volunteer work. Partner studies and works part time.  


I'm a bit hesitant about moving because I won't be able to receive my pension if I go to a different country. I've tried talking to my partner about this but he seems to think I'll just be able to find a job over there. I haven't managed to find anywhere that will hire me with my illness here, so I'm doubtful that a foreign country where I barely speak the language will be any better. I suggested that I stay here and we do long distance for a bit, but my partner is very against that.

  
I told him that, realistically, I won't be able to work and that he'll be responsible for financially supporting me for the most part. My illness isn't going to magically go away, it is degenerative, and he knows this. I do have savings, but not enough to support me for an entire year. I don't think he's really thought about this, because I'm pretty self-sufficient at the moment because I have a consistent income.

  
He won't budge and thinks I'll be able to be a bartender (have done training, but can't physically stand longer than ten minutes) or support myself through art. I clearly said to him that if he really doesn't think he can help support me, then we need to either think about long distance or break up. He's now really upset and thinks it's unfair that I expect him to look after me when he wants us to be equals. I feel like I'm being an asshole for both expecting him to pay my way and for saying we have to break up if he can't. I really don't want to break up, but I need to be realistic about my future.

tl;dr: Partner wants us to move overseas for a year but doesn't want to financially support me after I lose my income"
