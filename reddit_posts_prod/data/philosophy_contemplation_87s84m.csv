Getting Past the Truth Debate,StumblingForwardPod,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/87s84m/getting_past_the_truth_debate/,43,9,"**tldr: the bolded text**

A couple friends of mine, Reid and Matt, and I [talked about the definition of truth](https://youtu.be/1kHpEN7XNFE?t=12m), referring to [an episode of Sam Harris's podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gdpyzwOOYY), “Waking Up With Sam Harris”.

**Introduction:**
Sam’s holds that truth is that which has happened; something that is verifiable, provable (ie. history, scientific truth). His stance reflects his staunch atheism, and he believes that a lot of religious stories are false, since they most likely haven’t happened.

Jordan holds a Darwinian, romantic perspective of truth. He argues that there are truths that share how to act in the world; these are not necessarily objectively true. He explains that these truths are revealed through communication and writing, fiction and nonfiction.

Sam argued that human truths are embedded inside objective truth, and Jordan argued vice versa.

**Our Discussion:**
Upon listening to Sam’s podcast, I discerned three variations of truth:
 
* *Objective truth* (everything that exists down to a molecular level), which is persistent, no matter how we perceive it
* *Knowledge*, which is human-defined interpretation of objective truth
* *Wisdom*, or how to act in the world (resembling Darwinian truth)

I noticed that **none of the truths are complete**. We don’t understand the physical world down to the quantum level, nor do we fully understand our brains. Therefore, it is difficult to make a definitive statement that one truth is embedded in another. 

Matthew was surprised by how **the idea of truth can be perceived in multiple valid ways**. Sam and Jordan are both esteemed intellects and have a point in each of their arguments. He pondered whether there are other words that we use with such varying definitions.

Reid sided with Sam’s definition of truth since people seemingly operate using this definition. He can easily wrap his head around the sense of objective truth. However, he gave credence to Jordan’s meta, pragmatic, and ethical perspective of truth. **Many stories have lessons that contain truths that may not have actually happened but are valuable nonetheless**. 

The world is made up of matter as well as space. Humans can therefore abstract and categorize. I pose that our idea of objective truth has been perceived through the lens of a human and spoken through human-constructed language. Therefore, **the actual objective truth is only a theory**. For example, we perceive different colors dependent on how photons are hitting our eyes. I argue that color doesn’t exist in the objective world, yet we can nevertheless say that something has a definite color.

Matthew draws a comparison to how speed doesn’t contain any information about direction, while velocity tells a fuller story of reality. He makes note that truth is current; it is what we know, right now. At one point, society thought the world was flat, and that fact was true. However, that **truth has changed over time**. He proposes that we may need separate words for instantaneous truth as opposed to persistent truth.

Reid makes note that society accepts truths such as, “the Earth is round”. Until something significant happens to the shape of the Earth, that fact will always be true. **Society has a clear idea of scientific consensus**. The scientific method is our tool to determine whether something is true. The words “theory” and “law” are used to distinguish the weight of different truths. We recognized, however, that we still aren’t completely certain that something currently predictable will always persist.

I pointed out that **most truths that we consider consensus are human-constructed abstractions**. If you ask someone, “what are you sitting on?”, they will most likely answer, “a chair”. However, chairs are made of wood, plastic, etc. And furthermore, something such as “wood” is just another human-constructed word that represents a certain arrangement of atoms, and so on with subatomic particles. We can’t even determine a clear definition of a chair since we include “bean bag chairs” and “sofas” all in the same category. “Things that people sit on” would still be inaccurate since we sit on many things that aren’t chairs. **In many cases, what is true is in accordance with what is most useful to us as we communicate**. By abstracting, we can efficiently convey ideas.

There are other human-perceived truths such as pain that cannot be disputed. Maybe, once we understand the whole brain, we can fully explain what is happening to create pain. Will the understanding of the whole brain allow us to understand consciousness?

Reid struggles with the idea that truth varies from person to person. He brings attention to the post-modernist idea: each person might have a different perception of truth. So what is actually true? He argues that **if two people have two different interpretations of the same event, they should not use the word “truth”**. There needs to be some kind of separate word.

The human brain has the ability to distort perception at an individual basis, because of genetics and experience, as well as phenomena such as hallucination and confirmation bias. It seems that **society decides on truth by majority understanding through language**. Human’s development of truth has been dependent on our ability to vocalize individual observations that most people can understand. By having a consensus on perception, we can determine the truth.

We contemplated why Sam and Jordan disagreed so strongly about the definition of truth. As a clinical psychologist, it makes sense that Jordan values a human perception of truth. Sam values objective logic and facts and does not want to skew the definition of truth to cater towards a species that will, at some point, cease to exist.

We conclude that **we need to be careful in our speech and that different types of truths need to be distinguished in conversation**. We brainstormed that, although inconvenient, we should try to use descriptors such as “objective” and “ethical” when describing truth. Nevertheless, the concept of truth deserves attention and discussion in our society.
