How do I get that drive to workout back,jab17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/a6pb4h/how_do_i_get_that_drive_to_workout_back/,412,1642,"I’ve been going to the gym for about a year and I’m at the point where I have an extremely low body fat percentage, with a decent amount of muscle to where my body looks really good.

 Lately I don’t have motivation to go to the gym. I go about once or twice a week instead of every day. I don’t have that drive I used to have, I assume it’s because my body looks good and in my mind I’m satisfied with how I look.

 I don’t want to be satisfied, I don’t know how not to be satisfied.I want to go to the gym but the motivation isn’t there. Any suggestions on how to get that drive back."
