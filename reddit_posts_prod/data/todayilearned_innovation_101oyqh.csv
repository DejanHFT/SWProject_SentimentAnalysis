"TIL right hand traffic in the US stemmed from the 1700s use of freight wagons pulled by several pairs of horses. These had no driver's seat, so the (typically right-handed) postilion held a whip in the right hand and thus sat on the left rear horse, preferring oncoming traffic to pass on the left.",anogre8me,https://infogalactic.com/info/Right-_and_left-hand_traffic,8,134,No text content
