Help me refine my Ethics!,TotoTheDog,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ef9s9/help_me_refine_my_ethics/,46,3,"I follow Kant's Categorical Imperative described in his *Groundwork*. I fully believe in a community of coordinating rational agents. However the CI is a test that tells me what **not** to do. It reveals which maxims are illegal.

Amongst those actions that pass the CI, I follow Aristotle's ethics. I have self-knowledge and I know not only that I am a rational agent, but my specialty is abstract thinking. I behave in such a way to manifest virtue in abstract thinking. This involves contemplation and action. I find the mean and manifest moral virtues of temperance, bravery, etc. These ethics tell me what **to** do.

What does /r/philosophy think? I'm not only constantly striving to behave in line with these ethics, I'm also trying to refine my ethics. Please share your thoughts!"
