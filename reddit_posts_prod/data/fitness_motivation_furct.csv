1 year doing select P90X DVDs + 2mi runs 1-2 wk (i.e. turning 30 is one hell of a motivator),MadScientist420,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/furct/1_year_doing_select_p90x_dvds_2mi_runs_12_wk_ie/,200,285,"I just looked at my before pictures for the first time since i took them and I was shocked at how different I [looked](http://imgur.com/7LxxN). Went from 195-200lb to 170lb (5'11"").  

Put more emphasis on getting lean rather than bulked (hence P90X).  

Anyway... hopefully this adds to the pile of motivational posts to help push those thinking about getting fit in the right direction!

Edit: thanks for all the praise all! I appreciate it. "
