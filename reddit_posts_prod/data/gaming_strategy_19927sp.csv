Best modern strategy games?,Fixylicious,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/19927sp/best_modern_strategy_games/,25,0,"I'm looking for stuff similar to AoE and AoM, but AoE 4 disappointed me for example, it just wasn't what I expected. Command & Conquer Generals was also nice back in the day.

Which ones would you suggest today, with improved graphics and a challenging gameplay?"
