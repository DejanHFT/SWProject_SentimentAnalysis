Your Unpopular opinions here! Whatâ€™re some Highly recommended books that you personally hated/DNF?,sputniksweetheartt,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/sabsyg/your_unpopular_opinions_here_whatre_some_highly/,5848,3180,"Iâ€™ve really found some awesome gems on this sub & r/suggestmeabook, but Iâ€™ve also come across some highly regarded, constantly suggested, +4 star rated titles that totally fell flat for me personally. Maybe itâ€™s just a difference in tastes but weâ€™ve all read some super hyped titles that just werenâ€™t it! Some popular books I really couldnâ€™t vibe with at all:

-The Night Circus - Mawkish, cloying far less thrilling a story than the book description suggested. But cool atmosphere.

-The Invisible Life of Addie - Awesome premise, but god was the story repetitive. MC felt hallow, extremely difficult to sympathize with.

-The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo - ðŸ¤® lifetime/hallmark overload for me

-The House on the Cerulean Sea - Iâ€™m all for fantastical uplifting stories with messages of acceptance & diversity but this story for all its hype sadly felt cliched, lacking in nuance & emotionally pandering. Maybe Iâ€™m just a cynical bastard but this book felt familiar in a bad way- like some YA fiction I wouldâ€™ve loved in middle school/high school but as an adult couldnâ€™t get past some glaringly trite literary elements in order to fully enjoy the story.

Alright sub letâ€™s hear some of your unpopular takes!"
