Human Centipede - Motivation to lift,tryitonce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/h83my/human_centipede_motivation_to_lift/,79,61,"OK so I was curious and it was on Netflix. Needless to say this is a horrible movie that is barely entertaining. The only good thing that came from it is that I had a chest day coming up....


So there is this scene where a ""skinny-fat"" guy is strapped to a hospital type bed and is being told this horriffic stuff that will be done to him by a deranged doctor. He starts trying to break free and yells and grunts etc. (obviously he isnt able to escape) In my mind I thought ""thats just a chest fly exercise, I can do that!"" So, I get to the gym and have my best chest workout in months. Im pretty sure any horror flick could be used as motivation because people are always getting tired from a 2 min run from a bad guy, unable to hang on to loved ones suspended over certain death, trapped in some way, or sentenced to some horrible fate that they could have avoided with a good sprint, more strength , or a super punch to a masked idiots solar plexus (plexis?)


If I was in a horror movie, it would be about 20 min long and boring, ending with a shot of me standing over the broken body of whatever retarded evil doctor tried to mess with me as I drink a protein shake."
