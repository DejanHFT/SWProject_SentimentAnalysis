Why are none of the COVID vaccines Live vaccines? Would a Live vaccine not offer better immunity given that the actual whole virus is present?,piggyballs,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/oq0iyf/why_are_none_of_the_covid_vaccines_live_vaccines/,16,0,"Follow up questions, would a recovered infection provide a stronger immunity (damage caused by illness notwithstanding), and would Live vaccine/ recovery provide better protection against variants?

I've tried looking this up but seem to only find fact-checking articles debunking claims about the vaccines containing the virus, or articles explaining how the current vaccines work. It also seems there isn't as much information about recovered immunity as opposed to the vaccines.

Appreciate any help"
