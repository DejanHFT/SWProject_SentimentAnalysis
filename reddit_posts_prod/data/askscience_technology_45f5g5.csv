What technologies actually use our understanding of general or special relativity?,infinitum17,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/45f5g5/what_technologies_actually_use_our_understanding/,28,23,"I've got this friend who keep saying that all this new astrophysics research is totally useless, and that Einstein's theories don't actually help anyone. But I know that's not true. Can you guys help me out and give some examples of of technologies that wouldn't be possible without understanding relativity, and how? 

Thank you so much!"
