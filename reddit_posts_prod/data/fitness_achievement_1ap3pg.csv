1000lb club achievement unlocked! Only if the road to a PhD were as linear....,Renyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1ap3pg/1000lb_club_achievement_unlocked_only_if_the_road/,74,105,"Sex: male

I finally reached my goal of 1000lbs for a set of 5 reps today after doing SS since last September, with a period of deloading during the holidays. For the most part, the progress was linear. I started out supplementing with GNC multivitamin, GNC fish oil, and ON whey protein, and then started taking ON creatine in January. 


Now that I've achieved my goal, I want to reduce some of the mass that I have gained for triathlon season without losing the strength that I worked so hard for. I would ideally like to go down 10 lbs, and incorporate swimming/running/biking into my weekly workout regime. Currently I'm leaning towards leangains, and would love to hear any input from fellow r/fitness members!


ps. my PhD is in human genetics, and my thesis is focused on the understanding of the genetic mechanism typing together aerobic capacity and metabolic health using a rat model. We've studied glucose/lipid utilization, aging, health risk factors, metabolic markers, and genomic regions that confer advantage for intrinsically performing exercise. I'd be happy to answer any questions about any of these topics.
