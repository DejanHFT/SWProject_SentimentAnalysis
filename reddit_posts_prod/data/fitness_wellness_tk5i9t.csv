Input needed! Handling diet and nutrition critiques,MCHammerCurls,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/tk5i9t/input_needed_handling_diet_and_nutrition_critiques/,58,214,"Diet and nutrition are key to achieving the goals many of our users have whether they be weight loss, weight gain, body composition changes, or general wellness.  As such, we see a lot of diet questions come through our daily thread or post approval requests.  Today, these are pointed to the daily questions posts without much guidance.

The mods have been discussing whether a weekly thread to capture diet questions would be useful.  Similar to our Physique Fridays, users would post their questions or plan for feedback.  Our knowledgeable members could provide suggestions, recommend macro adjustments, or reassure someone that they're on the right path.

Alternatively, we've discussed adding diet critiques to our [Rule 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules/rule9) and requiring submitters to provide a baseline of information about their stats, their goal, and their plan when commenting in the daily questions thread.

With either approach, we'd hope the responses are more thoughtful than the ""eat less"" and ""eat more"" reactions we see now.  While that's often the basic need, it misses the nuance or specifics that would better help someone to reach their goal, and these thoughtful responses are what should set us apart from r/loseit and r/gainit.

We welcome your votes and your thoughts as we decide what to do!
