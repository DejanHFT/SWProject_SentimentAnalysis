Science AMA Series: We are University of Sydney physicists working at the nanoscale – from quantum engineering to photonics (light). Hear how we are building technology using the most fundamental constituents of matter and trying to change the world. Ask us anything!,Nanoscale_science,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4k49mm/science_ama_series_we_are_university_of_sydney/,317,2605,"Hi Reddit!
 
We (Professor David Reilly, Professor Benjamin Eggleton, Associate Professor Michael Biercuk) have just moved into a $150 million purpose-built research and educational facility at the University of Sydney. The [Sydney Nanoscience Hub](https://sydney.edu.au/nano/) building has been specifically designed to enable new science at the nanoscale and will form the centrepiece of an innovation ecosystem enabled by access to the most precise lab environments on earth. 
 
We seek to manipulate matter at the scale of a billionth of a metre to transform areas as diverse as health and medicine to communications, IT and [security](https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2016/03/22/breakthrough-technology-to-improve-cyber-security-.html). Some have described it as [science fiction come true](https://au.news.yahoo.com/video/watch/31057235/science-fiction-comes-true-in-sydney/#page1).
 
[Professor Ben Eggleton](https://sydney.edu.au/science/people/benjamin.eggleton.php) – Ask me about the evolution of nanophotonics (behaviour of light at the nanoscale). I am building a photonic chip that will essentially put the entire optical network on to a chip the size of your thumbnail. This research has the potential to exponentially increase internet speeds.
 
[Associate Professor Michael Biercuk](https://sydney.edu.au/science/people/michael.biercuk.php) – Ask me about building technology atom by atom, quantum simulation, and putting quantum systems to work for us!
 
[Professor David Reilly](https://sydney.edu.au/science/people/david.reilly.php) – Ask me about quantum nanoscience and how this research will change our world. I recently answered a heap of questions about this topic from Huffington Post readers, I also evaluated Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s definition of [quantum computing](http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/05/03/justin-trudeau-quantum-computing-dave-reilly_n_9835088.html).

Ask us anything!

edit: Thanks for all your amazing questions, we'll be on in less than an hour to answer them.
