"""I Like Beautiful Melodies Telling Me Terrible Things."" What song fits the description?",rahil_cyclone,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/16hedt0/i_like_beautiful_melodies_telling_me_terrible/,664,324,"It's a quote by American musician Tom Waits. A song called Komm SÃ¼sser Tod - Come Sweet Death from the anime Evangelion fits this description perfectly.
