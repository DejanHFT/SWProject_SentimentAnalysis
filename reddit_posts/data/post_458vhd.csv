Gravitational Wave Megathread,AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/458vhd/gravitational_wave_megathread/,2713,19493,"Hi everyone! We are *very* excited about the upcoming press release (10:30 EST / 15:30 UTC) from the [LIGO](http://www.ligo.org) collaboration, a ground-based experiment to detect gravitational waves. This thread will be edited as updates become available. We'll have a number of panelists in and out (who will also be listening in), so please ask questions!

FAQ:

> Where do they come from?

The source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). 

> How fast do they go?

Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity)).

> Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?

The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16).

In 2014, the [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.

> Does this mean we can control gravity?

No. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html).

> What's the practical application?

[Here](http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.

> How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (See limits on gravitons below!)
