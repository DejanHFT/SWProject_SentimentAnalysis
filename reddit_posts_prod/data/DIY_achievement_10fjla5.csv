Using a manual Router to carve channels into Acrylic Sheet? Only seen done with CNC,eNJineer99,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/10fjla5/using_a_manual_router_to_carve_channels_into/,6,7,"I am looking to create a sign in a similar fashion to this video:[https://www.tiktok.com/@hdjsign2/video/7162092144918809899](https://www.tiktok.com/@hdjsign2/video/7162092144918809899)

I can't find anyone online who has done the same thing with a non-fixed router instead of CNC, and I can't understand why.

I understand acrylic is brittle, but I can't afford to have the specific patterns CNC'd for me. Can I achieve passable results with a woodshop router and a carbide cutting bit on 1/4"" acrylic? I have mediocre woodworking experience.

TIA"
