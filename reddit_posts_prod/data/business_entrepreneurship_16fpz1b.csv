Looking for entrepreneurship events or seminars to attend,Hot_Builder7317,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/16fpz1b/looking_for_entrepreneurship_events_or_seminars/,0,1,"I live in India and Im interested in entrepreneurship/business and am looking to engage with people that are aspiring entrepreneurs as well. 

Attending events/seminars and interacting with people in the community can prove helpful. One can get more clarity on topics like finding good business opportunities/problems, low capital situation, committing to a field/industry, looking at what other people are doing etc. 

Please feel free to share details of any such events that you might know or have heard of, maybe attended in the past. Thanks"
