Retaining information is so difficult,MovieMuscle25,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/g2tv1j/retaining_information_is_so_difficult/,16,18,"I like reading a lot of historical books, but I have no idea how to retain the information of these 1000+-page books.

For instance, I'm reading a lengthy book on the history of the Middle East. It's very fascinating as I read from page to page, and I grasp the information pretty well. However, a week or two later, I don't really remember the details of the previous chapter. I remember vague details like bombs being dropped that cause plenty of damage in certain areas and a lot of people dying, but is that really what I read 60 pages of a chapter for? What's the point?

How do you guys end up retaining a lot of the information from these detailed and insightful historical books? Sometimes, videos help for me, but there's only so many documentaries out there on certain subjects...

EDIT: I appreciate all the feedback. Just to clarify, I am reading for pleasure, not studying or professional purposes, but I think note-taking is fair.

Keep in mind, this is Robert Fisk's ""The Great War for Civilization,"" and he spends a lot of time on his personal worldviews. There's a lot of pages that graphically describe deaths and destruction just to further heighten his argument. Also, there are so many books (fictional, historical, and non-fictional in general) on my docket that I don't know if I can spare time re-reading whole chapters of a 1,000-page book."
