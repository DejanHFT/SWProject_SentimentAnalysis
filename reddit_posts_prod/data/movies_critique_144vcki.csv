Watched American Psycho and Wow,rattler1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/144vcki/watched_american_psycho_and_wow/,75,78,"This film has been on my to-do list for a long time. I know it’s a classic, and I’ve seen clips. I actually started it thinking “I’ll watch a bit and a finish it later” but I watched the whole thing. I was sucked in from the first moment to the last. I will say I was very disturbed, but the story telling was exceptional. Christian Bale was also incredibly cast. This film left me feeling a bit disappointed in most of Hollywood lately. It reminded me of the art behind film making. I know I’m way behind the times here but I had a really enjoyably viewing experience and I really want to watch more films with this kind of grittiness. Anyway, I’d give it 5 stars but that’s me. What’s your take?"
