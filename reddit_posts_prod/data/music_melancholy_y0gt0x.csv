What song would you like to have played at your funeral? Why?,grabmyeye,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/y0gt0x/what_song_would_you_like_to_have_played_at_your/,181,27,"For me, it would be ""Where rainbows never die"" by The Steeldrivers (Chris Stapleton). It's so melancholy and sweet and fits the theme perfectly. Tells the story of an old man ready to die. https://youtu.be/uBx76N9tudQ"
