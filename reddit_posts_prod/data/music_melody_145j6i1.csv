familiar classical melody in a modern song,Null_cz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/145j6i1/familiar_classical_melody_in_a_modern_song/,3,3,"I recently stubmled upon [this song on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_a02WPla6k) - Once Again by Scrap Guys. I know the melody from somewhere else, but I am just unable figure out what it is.

Friends are saying it's some classical music like Mozart, but were not able to find it. I am almost sure I heard it in the older Piano Tiles games, but could not find it in any of the piano tiles playlists.

Please help, this spreads like a virus, anyone I share this with becomes obsessed and has to search for it too. I just infected you too, so please help us all find a cure - what is it similar to? Why does it seem so familiar?"
