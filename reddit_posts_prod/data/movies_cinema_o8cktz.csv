Please watch Cinema Paradiso,ElCapi123,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/o8cktz/please_watch_cinema_paradiso/,15,19," Today I saw one of the best movies of my life, besides being beautiful it has a simply perfect soundtrack, directed by Ennio Morricone. Few times has a movie marked me so much and made me cry like a child, I recommend them to everyone.

Here the Synopsis of the film: 'Cinema Paradiso' is a love story for cinema. It tells the story of Salvatore, a boy from a small Italian town where the only hobby is going to the movies. Overwhelmed by moving images, the boy blindly believes that cinema is magic; but, one day, Alfredo, the operator, agrees to teach the little boy the mysteries and secrets that are hidden behind a movie. Salvatore is growing up and the moment comes when he must leave the town and look for his life. Thirty years later he receives a message, in which he is told that he must return home.
