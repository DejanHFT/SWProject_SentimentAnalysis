Laminate side table water damage. Want to fill and paint?,mondo_matt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/193jen8,12,0,Hey this table has a laminate on it but it’s badly water damaged and flaking underneath. I’d like to just somehow fill this so it’s solid again. Maybe I need to cut the laminate away and fill? Then paint the whole thing. Can anyone advise what the best materials would be to achieve this? Thanks in advance.
