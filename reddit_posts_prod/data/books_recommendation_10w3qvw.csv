I was recommended reading more ‘grounded’ books?,Winduer,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10w3qvw/i_was_recommended_reading_more_grounded_books/,591,1108,"The other day I went to get tested for ADHD and the consular and I got to talking about books. I mentioned that I mainly read fantasy and how that is my general interest. She recommended that I start reading more nonfiction books to get more grounded in reality. 

Is this good advice? 

I do not know how I feel about this. Is there a reason for me to broaden my reading interests? I’ve felt like I’ve learned a lot from fiction books, sure some are nonsense (I do not think I need to learn how to care for a dragon) but I’ve learned how to deal with people emotionally and other such things. 

Would reading nonfiction books or some more based in reality ground me more? (I do not think I need grounding… although that might just be me) What do you guys think?"
