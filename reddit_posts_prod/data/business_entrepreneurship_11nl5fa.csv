Can someone recommend me business books that would equip someone with enough knowledge to start a business.,MrCensoredFace,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/11nl5fa/can_someone_recommend_me_business_books_that/,6,2,"Hi guys, so i really like to learn about stuff and recently developed a slight interest in business and entrepreneurship. Can anyone recommend me a list of books that a person would read before deciding to start a business, assuming i have no certifications in business. Ofcourse i know that merely reading would never help, but I'm sure that there is some quintessential knowledge needed to run one. Like i can build a machine without knowing engineering. Same way, i cant build a business without knowing the business knowledge."
