* Critics Consensus: Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire proves Zack Snyder hasn't lost his visual flair, but eye candy isn't enough to offset a storyline made up of various sci-fi/fantasy tropes.

>Snyder, who shot the film himself, stages it on an impressively lavish scale (all the CGI sprawl a budget of $166 million can buy), and a handful of the episodes are fun, like one where the noble hunk Tarak (Staz Nair) frees himself from indentured servitude by harnassing a giant blackbird who’s like a Ray Harryhausen creature. Sofia Boutella, as Kora, holds the film together with her dour ferocity, and Djimon Hounsou (as the fallen but still noble General Titus), Charlie Hunnam (as the mercenary starship pilot Kai), and Anthony Hopkins (as the voice of Jimmy the droid, who’s like C-3PO with more acting talent) make their presence felt. Yet “Rebel Moon,” while eminently watchable, is a movie built so entirely out of spare parts that it may, in the end, be for Snyder cultists only.

>By the end of ""Rebel Moon,"" the closing title card of ""End Part One"" feels more like a threat than a promise.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/rebel-moon-part-one-a-child-of-fire-review-zack-snyder-netflix-1235757555/):

>Snyder never met a superhero team roundup he didn’t love, and although he’s put aside capes and spandex for rugged galactic garb, the screenplay he co-wrote with Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten plays like the result of someone feeding *Seven Samurai* and *Star Wars* into AI scriptwriting software.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2023/12/rebel-moon-review-zack-snyders-visual-splendor-narrative-disarray-1235668946/):

>*Rebel Moon* is a film that struggles to find its own voice amidst a litany of borrowed themes and styles. While visually impressive, it lacks the coherence and character depth needed to elevate it beyond a mere pastiche of its influences. Snyder’s fans might find elements to appreciate, but for those seeking a fresh and engaging sci-fi adventure, this film may not hit the mark. Then again, this is part one so maybe part two will give the narrative room to breathe.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/rebel-moon-part-1-a-child-of-fire-review-zack-snyder-netflix/):

>“Rebel Moon – Part 1: A Child of Fire” isn’t a complete film. The story will continue and presumably conclude in the next installment. So perhaps some of this movie’s issues will be addressed later on, and “Part 1” will improve with the benefit of hindsight. Or perhaps it will look worse after the follow-up comes out, which is equally plausible. Until then it is simply what it is, and that is a hugely expensive but uninspired “Star Wars” knockoff with some thrilling action sequences, and some truly ugly moments that taint the entire thing.

>With Rebel Moon, Snyder is positively bursting with exciting ideas, but they lack compelling characters and a solid plot to hold them up.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-part-one-review-netflix-zack-snyder) (4/10):

>Despite a great ensemble cast, Zack Snyder's space opera is let down by a derivative patchwork script, mediocre action sequences and a superficial story that fails to live up to its expansive promise.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/rebel-moon-part-one-a-child-of-fire-review-zack-snyder-netflix-1234935678/) (D-):

>I assume that we’ll learn a little bit more about Djimon Hounsou’s drunken tactical genius when the Imperium descends upon the Veldt in the second part of “Rebel Moon,” and that Anthony Hopkins’ robot will explain why it’s wearing a pair of antlers in the last shots, but it’s also possible these unanswered questions are merely a pretext for another Snyder Cut — one that Netflix can use to squeeze a few more view hours out of a movie so insufferable that it should be measured in milliseconds. Whatever the case, it’s hard to be even morbidly curious, let alone excited, about any future iterations or installments of a franchise so determined to remix a million things you’ve seen before into one thing you’ll wish you’d never seen at all.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/rebel-moon-part-one-review-netflix/) (3/5):

>Zack Snyder never does anything by halves. But even by his standards, the first part of his long-gestating space saga is a thunderous, portentous, gargantuan slab of mythological sci-fi fantasy. 

[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/rebel-moon-review-zack-snyder-b2463306.html) (1/5):

>The ‘Justice League Director’s Cut’ filmmaker has made his own version of a Star Wars movie, only filled with motivational speeches, sexual violence and Charlie Hunnam stumbling his way through a soon-to-be-infamous Irish accent

[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20231215-rebel-moon-review-zack-snyders-new-space-opera-is-gushing-star-wars-fan-fiction) (2/5):

>Nothing exciting happens. There are no challenges to meet, no obstacles to overcome, no Death Stars to destroy. Despite the grandiosity of the film's bombastic tone, the story turns out to be disappointingly minor, presumably because Snyder's main aim was to introduce the cast and to set the scene for Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver, which is due next year. Part One itself ends up feeling a bit pointless.

[Inverse](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/rebel-moon-review-netflix-zack-snyder):

>*Rebel Moon* may come off as a blitz of interesting ideas that have yet to be fleshed out in earnest. It doesn’t help that *A Child of Fire* ends on a cliffhanger of sorts, effectively demanding a follow-up. The optimists among us — and yes, the Snyder bros, too — may read this first installment as an overture, its many loose threads more like a breadcrumb trail for future installments to circle back to. It’s ironic to expect more from a director that’s already synonymous with maximalism\*.\* Beneath all its spectacle, though, the *Rebel Moon* universe could do with a bit more context.

[Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24001958/rebel-moon-part-one-child-of-fire-review-zack-snyder-star-wars):

>It’s a bummer to have to dunk so hard on a brand-new piece of fantasy nerddom, delivered just in time for the holidays. But try as he might, Snyder just can’t match the archetypal sincerity nor the outlandish imagination of the films he’s trying to emulate here. *Child of Fire* may not be his worst film, but it’s certainly his least inspired. Thanks to those five scary words in the end credits, it’s also his worst-looking. *Part Two: The Scargiver* is set to be released in April 2024. What fresh hell awaits us then?

[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/rebel-moon-part-one-a-child-of-fire-zack-snyder-review/) (40/100):

>This first half of Snyder’s diptych (the second is due in the spring) is more of a loosely doodled mood board than a functioning film – a series of pulpy tableaux that mostly sound fun in isolation, but become numbingly dull when run side by side.
