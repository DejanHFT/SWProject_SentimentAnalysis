Advice regarding diet to achieve Body Weight skills,DrPotato231,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/g79mln/advice_regarding_diet_to_achieve_body_weight/,4,2,"Hello, everyone! This is the first time I'm posting here because I wanted to  look for quality advice regarding my eating lifestyle.

For  the past 1.5 years, I've been training a mix of calisthenics and  weight-lifting to attain skills using my own body weight. Specifically  speaking, I've been training to achieve the planche, muscle-ups, front  lever, free handstand push-ups, etc. Pretty much everything that allows  me to control my body completely. I've made very good progress.  Comparing the videos of my performance in the tucked planche, tucked  front lever, weighted pull-ups, negative straddle, etc. 6 months ago and  now, I'm quite happy with the way things worked out, although there's  still much left to train for.

Now,  with all of that context taken out of the way, I wanted to focus on the  role of diet, since it is an important factor in body weight training. 2  years ago, I used to weight 94kg (207lbs) and my BF% was at around  \~30%. Currently, I weight 78kg (172lbs) and my BF% is hovering around  \~12%. Obviously, that allowed me to make huge progress when I began  exercising. The problem, however, is that I believe I'm starting to hit a  plateau in my progress towards the skills, and I wanted to know if it's  just a matter of patience (keep exercising and not expecting too much  progress, as it gets harder and harder) or if I should change my diet to  further improve my performance.

Regarding  details of my diet, I've been trying to maintain a caloric deficit with  a high amount of protein to cut all the unnecessary fat and keep/gain  muscle at the same time. I'm not entirely sure how many calories I need  for maintenance, but I try to consume \~1800-2000 calories per day with  at least 150g-170g of protein. I don't consume too many carbs (bananas  are one of the few sources I consume, as an example). Surprisingly, I've  noticed that I haven't lost weight in the past couple of months, so I  think that either I'm not calculating my calorie consumption correctly  or those \~1800-2000 calories are my new maintenance. It doesn't really  bother me, since I've already lost a lot of weight and gained muscle,  but that got me thinking whether it's impacting my performance or not.

So,  it all boils down to the question, once again, of what I should do regarding my diet with the only objective of achieving said skills. Will maintaining the ""caloric deficit"" help me achieve the body weight skills? Should I go for a caloric surplus  instead? Should I cut my caloric intake a little bit more to lose more  fat?

Thank you very much!

P.S: It felt like the way I wrote my post and phrased the sentences was horrible, so I apologize if it was a boring read."
