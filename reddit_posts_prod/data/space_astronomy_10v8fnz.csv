"Making a Astronomy focused bday present for a friend - anyone have any (very obscure) cool space photos with really interesting stories behind them, or just cool stories about Astronomy that not many people know about?",GiveMeTheFullerenes,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/10v8fnz/making_a_astronomy_focused_bday_present_for_a/,10,21," Basically the title; It’s a friends 18th and I’m making one of those letter-art galleries, and painting small photos of cool space photos, and writing thier stories on the back of the letter - of course having some reference to her birthday.

Eg: story of the mariner 4 probe whose researchers colored a wall according to the 1’s and 0’s they received, and ended up with a pre-visualization of the photo the probe sent back before actually processing the image."
