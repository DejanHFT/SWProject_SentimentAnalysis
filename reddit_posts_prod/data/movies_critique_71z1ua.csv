[Spoilers]Off-topic Kingsmen: Golden Circle critique,SmoresPies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/71z1ua/spoilersofftopic_kingsmen_golden_circle_critique/,2,0,"So, I saw this movie last night along with a handful of 10-13 year olds, treated by their fathers. Nothing wrong with that. My dad did the same with for me with Bad Boys II. What stuck out to me as completely odd about Kingsmen is the complete joke the traditional relationship has become.

SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT:

Scene 1, with the lovers: We're shown Eggsy and the Princess in a happy relationship, getting ready for the next big step- meeting her parents.

Scene 2: Eggsy is at dinner with his girlfriend's parents for the first time, while he's simultaneously researching the antagonist with another field agent, a smoking hot fox who's been vetted to the nines as a sexy-librarian. Once their work is complete, they exchange a few flirty-winky texts, while he is literally staring at his girlfriend between her parents.

Scene 3: THEN in the middle of the film, Eggsy quite literally calls his girlfriend and straight up asks her if he can sleep with this other girl, who's working for the antagonist. Now, I understand that the story builds up to this point that he has to do it in order to save the world(i.e. the running joke at the end of the first film) but, as the scene progresses.... she says it would only be fine IF he asked her to marry him, then she would be okay with it...*what?!* 

She's only a little mad and smokes some contaminated weed to cope. But, it's okay though he can't go through with it. He just fingers the other girl instead...

Finally, scene 4: at the end of the film...the Kingsmen save the day and Eggsy marries the princess.

That's it. Those are the only scenes you see their relationship in. It really seemed to encourage infidelity for men, because you'll still get the one girl at the end if you try hard enough, while encouraging complacency for women to absorb all heartache for the ring. 

I don't consider myself an old-fuddy-duddy just yet. I'm all for the zany wild adventure a film like this brings but overall, the subplot just struck me as out of place, pushing a narrative that no one, at least in my golden-social circle would adhere to"
