Cheap but delicious gifts?,Goodlemur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/rh5w28/cheap_but_delicious_gifts/,76,39,"Hey guys. I'm at the point of Christmas where I'm low on money. Looking to make some cheap food-related gifts (jams, jellies, herb butters, nuts..?)   


Could you guys please help with ideas/recipes? Preferably things that can be made on a stovetop, but oven is fine too. Thanks in advance!"
