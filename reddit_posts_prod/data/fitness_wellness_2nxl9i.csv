Lifting well selling plasma.,aggzilla,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2nxl9i/lifting_well_selling_plasma/,8,7,"Hello, I was wondering about lifting/getting cut while selling plasma. With the plasma I'd go twice a week and they return the red blood cells and replace the plasma with a water solution. I was wondering, if I workout before the donation and still get my macros, would this effect my cuts?"
