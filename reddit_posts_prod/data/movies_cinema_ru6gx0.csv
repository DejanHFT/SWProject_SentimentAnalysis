"Growing up on films like The Abyss and The Big Blue, I feel like cinema needs to rediscover its fascination for the deep.",shannister,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ru6gx0/growing_up_on_films_like_the_abyss_and_the_big/,377,2416,"Somehow it seems we can only treat the depths of our oceans as horror films lately. While we’ve had a somewhat healthy dose of inspiring journeys into space, I’d love to see a major filmmaker reconnect with the wild, magnetic attraction of losing ourselves in the deep oceans. I’m actually curious to see where Cameron will go on Avatar 2, but it I’d love to see what someone like Nolan or Villeneuve could do."
