I'm an autistic adult who would like to get a chance to get a higher education. I had to drop out of high school due to my disorder but I did get my GED. In most subjects, I'm perfectly comfortable but when it comes to Math, I have panic attacks.

I'm curious if anyone knows of a good online resource for relearning math? I'd like to start at a fairly low level, above subtraction and addition, so I guess at division onward. I do suffer from dyscalculia which has been a major challenge throughout my life but if I want to actually get a degree I need to work hard on my issue with Math.

I'm also 40 years old if that changes things? I would like the resource to be free and hopefully interactive and with tests. I've searched around a bit but the options are a touch overwhelming and for a lot of them I end up wasting time signing up only to find out the website doesn't meet my needs."
