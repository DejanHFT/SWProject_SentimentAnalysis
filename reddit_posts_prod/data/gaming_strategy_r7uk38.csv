Strategy game recommendations needed.,daeowa,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/r7uk38/strategy_game_recommendations_needed/,12,3,"I'm buying a PC soon, solely because I miss playing good strategy games. I tried Civilization on PS4 and enjoyed it; however, it wasn't *exactly* what I was looking for, so I'm looking for recommendations - any would be greatly appreciated. 

Here are the factors I'm looking for:

1) I want a game that would allow me to favour people under my rule - such as royalty, generals, etc, etc - basically allow me to not only rule a nation but also create heroes. To get a better idea of what I'm talking about, I thoroughly enjoyed Shadow of War's nemesis system - it allowed me to be a d*ck to one person under my rule, and completely favour/strengthen another. 

2) A game that wouldn't punish me for being too reckless/hot-headed. I basically like wrecking stuff lol I want to be able to ruin alliances in seconds and destroy other nations with pure military strength.

3) I *prefer* medieval and/or fantasy genres, and extremely dislike sci-fi/spacy games; however, I wouldn't mind modern settings.

4) Politics. Kinda like how Stellaris has that whole system where you choose what kind of nation you want to be. 

Thank you to anyone who suggests me games they think would fit my preferences. I know they're a lot to keep in mind, so please don't try and be 100% accurate - even something that fits 60% of my preferences would be appreciated.

Edit: grammar."
