Explore London near LHR having 10.5 hours layover T3?,ascension1110,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17pp6bd/explore_london_near_lhr_having_105_hours_layover/,5,1,"Hi

Never been to UK and have layover at LHR from 8.30 until 19:00, everything booked directly with BA under 1 PNR. I was wondering if I can see something beautiful nearby , I know that not everything is possible but I think something worth seeing which takes like 4 hours\~

The only one thing I know is this Heathrow express to paddinton which I can take from T3 I guess after clearing immigration? I see round trip( for 35 pounds)

**My interests would be to see things like London Eye, beautiful/historical buildings from outside, Stonehenge(not possible I think haha)** *not into parks or checking out museums from inside. If anything famous cuisine to try then yeah that too.*

I will definitely plan UK in future with proper stay but for now just a quick trip.

Please suggest if I should venture out f the airport , if yes then what do you suggest to see in such a short span of time?

Thanks in advance
