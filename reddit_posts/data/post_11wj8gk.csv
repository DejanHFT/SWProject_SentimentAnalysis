What the hell is the actual difference between an isotope and a nuclide??,amypinecone,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/11wj8gk/what_the_hell_is_the_actual_difference_between_an/,17,19,"I've been spending the past few hours looking everywhere for answers and I just can't find anything that makes sense to me. Everywhere I looked, the definitions given one after the other for isotopes vs nuclides were almost exactly the same, but then they'd say something vague afterwards like ""but there are a few aspects that make them different to eachother"" and then it wouldn't elaborate further. Like, all the articles and websites would describe isotopes as ""the sum of the neutrons and protons in an atom"" and then they would describe nuclides as ""the combination of neutrons and protons in an atom"". I even interrogated an AI model on this in depth and got basically the same vague confusing answers. What is the difference in those definitions?? Please help."
