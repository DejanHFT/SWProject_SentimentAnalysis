How is quantum mechanics responsible for modern-day technology?,sarvagnap,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ngzn9/how_is_quantum_mechanics_responsible_for/,35,41,"We hear this a lot but I just wanted to know how exactly quantum mechanics discoveries are responsible for the modern day technology revolution.  Perhaps as a start-off point, how did it lead to the invention of a computer?  Why would a computer be impossible without quantum mechanics.  

I have a good understanding of undergraduate level introductory physics.  Am a Biology major myself."
