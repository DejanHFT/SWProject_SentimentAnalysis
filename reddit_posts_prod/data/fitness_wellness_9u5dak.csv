How to eat well while traveling on a budget?,coffee_snake,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9u5dak/how_to_eat_well_while_traveling_on_a_budget/,29,25,"Hey all,

I am going to be traveling for 2 solid weeks.  I plan on visiting some gyms along the way, and I've even scheduled my workouts accordingly, so i'm not actually missing any days of training.  The only issue for me is how I can manage my diet/nutrition while i'm without a kitchen.  I have about $40/day to spend on food, but I may or may not be able to find good quality food along the way.  I know fast food is easy to come by, but I'd rather not resort to eating crappy calories.  I don't really have enough space in my vehicle to load up on 14 days worth of good food.  I do plan on making one last Costco trip before I leave and getting a bunch of cans of tuna to manage my protein intake, but any other food ""hacks"" would be great.  Mostly, I want to maintain around 2500-2800 calories and all the essential macros during my trip.  I'm 6' 160 lbs.

My goal is to arrive at my final destination as if I had never missed a training day and had no breaks in my diet/nutrition.

Thanks in advance!"
