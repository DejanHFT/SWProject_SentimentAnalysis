Literary Podcasts,nyav-qs,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/b111sy/literary_podcasts/,45,27,"Does anyone listen to any book-themed podcasts? Not about a specific book or series, I’m looking for something where people discuss trends, topics or authors in the industry. I usually listen to true crime pods but I definitely need a break. Any favorites? I’ve looked through some listicles but nothing jumped out at me. 

Edit for anyone viewing this at a later date. I will update as I go through the suggestions. My fave lit podcasts as a result of this thread:

Overdue for episodes on specific books, over 300 and counting 

Book Riot the Podcast for literary industry news and hot topic discussions"
