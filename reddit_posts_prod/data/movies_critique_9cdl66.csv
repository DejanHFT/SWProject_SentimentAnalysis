"Creating a movie subreddit to discuss, critique, remember, quote, and otherwise enjoy classic/cult movies of the last 25 years or so. Does one exist and if not, what’s the best way to create this subreddit?",bdlcalichef,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9cdl66/creating_a_movie_subreddit_to_discuss_critique/,19,10,"I’d like to create a subreddit/community of people who would like to discuss 3 or more classic/cult movies of the past 25 years or so.

Working for 20 years or so in kitchens and restaurants I’ve noticed there’s a good deal of people who absolutely love quoting cult movies, discussing behind-the-scenes information and otherwise just appreciating the movies of my youth and early adulthood. 

My plan would be for moderators to jump on every day or every other day and drop the name of a classic/cult movie. For instance, as a moderator I’d start with a movie title headline:

Tombstone 
(1993)
[Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott, Michael Biehn]

The film is based on events in Tombstone, Arizona, including the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and the Earp Vendetta Ride, during the 1880s. It depicts a number of Western outlaws and lawmen, such as Wyatt Earp, William Brocius, Johnny Ringo, and Doc Holliday.

Tombstone was released by Hollywood Pictures in theatrical wide release in the United States on December 25, 1993, grossing $56.5 million in domestic ticket sales. The film was a financial success, and for the Western genre, it ranks number 16 in the list of highest-grossing films since 1979.[6] Critical reception was generally positive.

This could then spawn a great conversation ranging from great quotes from the movie,

“Maybe Poker’s just not your game, Ike. I know – let’s have a spelling contest!” - Doc Holliday

Anyone subscribed to this subreddit could then riff off one another with quotes before or after this. This movie has amazing dialogue between the characters and it seems like people love quoting great movies with great dialogue.

Others could chime in with some trivia,

In an interview with True West Magazine in October 2006, Kurt Russell admits that after original Director Kevin Jarre was fired, he directed a majority of the picture. According to Russell, George P. Cosmatos served merely to make things run smoothly. Also, in the True West interview, Kurt Russell states that the film was nearly cast with Richard Gere as Wyatt Earp, and Willem Dafoe as Doc Holliday.

And still others could reminisce about what the movie meant to them when it was a movie in regular rotation for someone personally,

For me, when I was about 14 or 15 (1994-1995) is when I started watching this movie over and over. It was that age where my friends and I first discovered alcohol and weed, and we’d just drink horribly cheap beer (Natural Lite, Old English Malt Liquor and horrible “bammer” brick weed full of seeds. We would sit in our respective parents basements or wherever and make up drinking games to play along to this movie. Drink whenever someone pulls a gun. Smoke whenever Doc Holliday is on screen.

To my knowledge there aren’t any subreddits like this. Most of the movies being discussed on r/movies are current movies. I’d like to create a subreddit community entirely based on discussing the cult classics of the 80’s until recently. Here’s a sample list of some movies I had in mind:

I could obviously go on and on and on but you get the idea. Also, the awesome part is that once each thread has been started it stays up for all time for people to add to whatever tangents appear over time. I would imagine with a core group of just a hundred or so redditors this could become an active and fun subreddit to contribute to. 

Anyway, I’ve never started a subreddit so I have no idea how to go about creating one, how to moderate one, how to get the subreddit out into the World to attract people to contribute or anything really outside of posting shit talk from my phone on Reddit. I imagine it’s probably best that I get this started from my laptop and not my tablet or phone.

Any advice, tips, ideas, or anyone wishing to contribute, moderate or be involved in anyway please let me know. I appreciate any and all feedback and I hope to get this going sometime soon. I know I’m not the only 38 year old who has spent a significant part of his life watching and rewatching movies over and over. Now I just need to find the other movie buffs spread across Reddit and hopefully get this subreddit going.

I was toying with the name r/cultandclassicmovies but would love and appreciate any feedback. Thanks Reddit Community!
