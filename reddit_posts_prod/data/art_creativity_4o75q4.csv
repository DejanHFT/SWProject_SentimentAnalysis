How much creativity per day is too much?,BesTCracK,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/4o75q4/how_much_creativity_per_day_is_too_much/,1,1,"Hello my dear art fellows,  
  
I was wondering how you manage to stay ""creative"" throughout the day if you for example work on multiple projects and stuff. I am a very creative person with (I would say) a pretty excellent imagination which I put to my work daily. I write stories, compose music and do graphic design/video compilling and or editing every single day and I wanted to add to this list practicing my digital drawing skills, since I have the next 4 months free, I wanna put them to good use.  
  
The thing is, if I happen to jump from writing to composing music, then to designing, then back to writing and then finally to drawing, I feel like my whole creative energy has been drained up and I need to take a break. So I take a break and play video games, but then I get too lazy and just end up playing them till midnight or until I pass out.  
  
How do you schedule your work so that you always stay with a ""full energy bar"" (for the gamers out there :P ) and with your creativity prepared for anything to come? I am a very impulsive person and when I wanna do something else instead of the thing I'm working on right now, I happen to instantly abandon the ship and go work on the other thing I wanna work on and I end up just jumping back and forth, draining myself to ""death"".  
  
Do you have any advices/tips/personal experiences to share with a fellow creative freak who just happens to work on too many things at once per day and wonders how much is ""too much""?"
