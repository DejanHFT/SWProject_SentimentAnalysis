Looking to mix a trip with a social adventure (Europe),Nearby_Source,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/wreuzr/looking_to_mix_a_trip_with_a_social_adventure/,6,2,"Hi!

I'm from northern Europe, and I try to do a trip each year around October to somewhere warmer in southern Europe to catch some much needed warmth and sun before the long winter. Last year I went  solo traveling for the first time, to Portugal, and I went for some semi-social activites. It was stuff like pub crawls, but also open guided tours and so forth. What I realized is, I really liked encountering strangers and getting to know some new people. I also realized that I regret never taking part of the Erasmus experience that a lot of people in Europe have done. I'm 32 now, so my studying days are behind me, but I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for something similar, but that could be achieved in the space of a trip?

As an example: I have a friend who went on a silent yoga retreat for two weeks, or something like that. Now, obviously I'm not sure I'd go for a silent yoga retreat, but the way he described it, that people all over Europe came to the same spot, and that he made new friends through it (when they stopped being silent, that is) sounded great. For me, there's something envigorating in encountering new people, and I want to know if anyone has any suggestions along those lines. I realize I partly don't know exactly what I'm asking for, I neither want a silent yoga retreat specifically, nor do I want a full-packed adventure of rafting in the wild or bungijumping. I just kind of want an interesting experience where I could meet fellow travelers. Now, some of you might say ""just stay in a hostel"" or ""keep doing that pub crawl thing"", and I guess those are legit answers, but if anyone understands what I'm talking about and have stories to share, please do!"
