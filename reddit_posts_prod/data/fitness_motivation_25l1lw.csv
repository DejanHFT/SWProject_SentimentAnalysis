How do you stay motivated while cutting?,DBish95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/25l1lw/how_do_you_stay_motivated_while_cutting/,94,52,"I have been cutting for the last two weeks after coming home from college and I seem to be hitting a wall of sorts. I seem to be constantly wondering if this is worth it and how the hell I am going to keep up with this for the rest of my life (not neccesarily cutting). I have really good self control but I love eating large portions and it is difficult forcing myself not to. 

How do you guys keep your motivation up?"
