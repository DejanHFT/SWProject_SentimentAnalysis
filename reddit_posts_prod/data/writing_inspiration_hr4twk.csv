There’s a difference between inspiration and ripoff.,CapriciousSalmon,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/hr4twk/theres_a_difference_between_inspiration_and_ripoff/,81,966,"Nowadays I feel people are sort of quick to call stuff ripoffs. But I do think there is a difference between something being inspired genuinely and saying it’s inspiration when really it’s a ripoff:

Inspiration is being genuinely motivated to tell a similar tale or use it to improve your own work. A rip-off is taking stuff from the work without realizing what made the work so great. 

If you want a comparison, a rip-off of South Park would be you trying to be South Park without realizing what made South Park so great. In drawn together, they made a parody of South Park that missed the mark: the SMT girl is basically cartman, who puts on a show that’s disgusting and raunchy, and it ends with her giving a stapled on message about the economy. It’d count as a rip-off because even in the worst episodes, South Park makes a whole story about the issue, and the messages are “tacked on” because the characters are children. The episodes are allowed to be raunchy because they make fun of everybody. When they did the episode where randy becomes the “n word guy”, they don’t repeat the word 100 times because they just want an excuse, but because the point of the episode is that if a racist word towards white people existed, it’d be quickly banned. 

Ripoffs don’t have their own identity because they spend too much time trying to be that one show, they don’t try in any other aspect: going back to drawn together, it had a really good premise. But because it wanted to be family guy without realizing why people liked it, it quickly went downhill and got cancelled in season 3. 

Even if you watched an episode of game of thrones and want to do a show like it, you should always try to be different and stand apart. What can I get out of your work I can’t get out of the original? What story can you tell that the original work(s) couldn’t? Suppose you wanted to a show on Fox and it was inspired by hey Arnold, a show where the censors said that helga’s mother had to drink smoothies because they couldn’t show alcohol. What could you tell me that hey Arnold can’t? Maybe you could focus on an issue like depression. Or something like having to deal with a really sick friend. 

If you want an example of inspiration, it would be gravity falls and twin peaks. Gravity falls is about a town of weird mysteries with weird characters and deep arcs, much like twin peaks. Fun fact: David lynch was originally supposed to voice bill cipher but when it went through, Alex hirsch did an impression of David lynch. Gravity falls wanted to have its own identity and so it did and it is considered a cult classic.

I say this because I’ve nearly given up a lot of works because I think they’re just ripoffs or rehashes. 

Again, it’s not the cliches you do, it’s how you do them."
