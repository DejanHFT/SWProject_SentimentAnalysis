3 Weeks exploring & photographing Madagascar,EpicAdriann,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/ztieth,278,7706,"In September we visited Madagascar and spent 3 weeks exploring the country, and photographing all the incredible landscapes and wildlife along the way! 

To date this is probably the most unique and diverse country I’ve visited, and absolutely beautiful - here’s some of my favourite photos from the trip

If you have any questions about travelling Madagascar, let me know - I’ll try my best to help!"
