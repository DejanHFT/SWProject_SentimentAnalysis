Crafting Crisp Edges in Epoxy: Seeking ideas for Dremel Lathe Technique,d_arthur,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/15uz0s5/crafting_crisp_edges_in_epoxy_seeking_ideas_for/,0,1,"I like creating model diorama bases with 2-part epoxy resin to simulate water, and while I've taken steps to prevent resin creeping up the sides of the mould, I'm still encountering some irregularity in the way it sets. 

My goal is to achieve impeccably smooth and crisp sides and a level top surface, like the precision of a cut gem. The pieces are only 3-5cm in diameter and about 1-2cm high. And I need suggestions on how to do this. 

My current idea is to use a [Dremel and a 220 Workstation](https://www.dremel.com/gb/en/p/dremel-workstation-26150220jb) as a mini lathe/pillar drill sander. I'd then have a method to polish the sides: Stick the underside of the diorama base to the bottom using a circular bit with a disk bit (like a saw bit). Once spinning, sand/polish off the irregularities by holding a sanding stick against the edge. 

And polish the top: Employing the Dremel like a pillar drill with a sanding attachment to file the top edge while the base is secured underneath. 

A point to note is that the sides of the base are bevelled.

My main hurdle lies in attaching the circular tool to the concave bottom of the base with enough strength and precision. I'm considering options like hot glue, super glue, or double sided tape as they offer a strong bond that can be removed later. However, precision is key here. The attachment must be PERFECTLY centered and level with the base. Even a minor imperfection could lead to the base spinning off-kilter along the X/Y axis during polishing, ruining the desired effect.

I'm seeking insights on a few fronts:

1. **Feasibility:** Does this idea sound viable to you?
2. **Attachment Method:** What's the best way to securely attach the base while ensuring accurate centering and leveling? Are there alternatives to hot glue or super glue that might work better?
3. **Adjustability:** Is there a specialized bit that allows for fine adjustments (around 0.1 mm at a time)? I tried it this once already just using a screw bit or the Dremel, and noticed that when the base spins, I can see if it's off-center because the way the edge looks blurry.  I'd love a setup that facilitates these minute corrections if possible.

Your experience and suggestions would help me achieve the flawless finish I'm aiming for. Thanks in advance for any advice!
