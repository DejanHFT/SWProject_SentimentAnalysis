Games where you attend to a colony and look for supplies and add bases.

New to the genre haven't really played anything but not sure where to start. 

Would like post apocalyptic but fantasy or military styled ones would be cool to

I'm mostly on pc and xbox/Nintendo switch 


Games you have a bunch of people to look after"
