What engineering improvements allowed the LTE standard to support higher data download rates when compared to 3G technologies such as HSPA & CMDA2000?,to_change,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/pushex/what_engineering_improvements_allowed_the_lte/,5,17,"Hello AskScience community! I am an ordinary consumer who recently took notice of the truly staggering improvements seen in the field of wireless data networking over the past 2 decades. Simply put, when I effortlessly play high quality YouTube videos on my phone with no issues, it truly feels like the engineering community is practicing black magic. I'd like to learn about how the RF engineering discipline was able to accomplish these improvements in a bit more technical detail. With that in mind, my question is as follows: **what specific engineering improvements (signal processing techniques, electronic hardware on the user terminal side or the RAN/base-station, backhaul, or core network ) allowed for LTE to have higher download speeds than comparable ""3G"" technologies, such as CDMA2000 and HSPA?**

I've tried to keep this question as specific as possible, but I do want to note that the same question could be posed of the various ""3G' technologies relative to their ""2G"" predecessors (GSM, CDMA) and that what I'm interesting in understanding is the full evolution of mobile technologies in at least a non-cursory level of detail. Resources would be welcomed!

Additionally, a sub-question that is of particular interest to me is about the interplay between hardware and signal processing techniques in generating improvements in data rates that I am asking about. Specifically, one of the key reasons that I have seen noted for the increase in data throughput in moving from 3G technologies to ""4G"" technologies is simply moving the channel to higher frequencies, where there is more bandwidth to play with. But this raises the question - why didn't the (very smart) engineers who were designing 3G technologies like CDMA2000 and HSPA design those technologies to work at the same higher frequencies? It could of course be that operating at those frequencies was not possible until new techniques - which weren't conceived of prior to the \~2005-07 period when LTE hit its stride in development - were developed. But I suspect that at least part of the reason has to do with the fact that electronics improved in some fashion to allow cost-feasible construction of RF circuits that can operate at such frequencies. But perhaps I am wrong!

Would greatly appreciate (relatively) technical answers to either the broader question of why LTE is faster than comparable 3G technologies and/or the more specific one about improvements in electronics!"
