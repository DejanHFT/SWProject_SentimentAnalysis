I find many BookTok recommendations not for me,QuietFoundation5464,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/16w2tx6/i_find_many_booktok_recommendations_not_for_me/,269,427,"I was actually trying to get into BookTok and I find myself disappointed by what's actually popular there.

One of the most recommended genre were either romance fantasy or just book about romance in general, which isn't my cup of tea at all. I could care less about those that have love scenes  being majority of the book.

Some of my most favorite books tend to be faster reads and in either fantasy (minus romance), action or mystery genre, and I very rarely see them getting as much hype as romance fantasy or romance genres on BookTok.

A lot of the most hyped books were mostly books about romance, like Colleen Hoover ones. even ACOTAR (a Court of Thrones and Roses) series didn't seem to attract me despite it's overhype."
