Rare and delicious fruit,Wise_Explorer_9342,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/plibq7/rare_and_delicious_fruit/,34,9,"Is there a fruit from your region that is amazing but difficult to get anywhere else?

- What is its name? 
- What makes it special? 
- Where is it available? 
- When is it in season?

There is a type of lychee in southern China called ‘mochi lychee’ and it’s huge, sweet, fragrant, juicy and has a tiny seed. IMHO it’s the best type of lychee. It’s in season around June I think. I have a craving for it now but it’s not available at the moment. There must be so many delicious fruits I haven’t tried because of regional limitations.
