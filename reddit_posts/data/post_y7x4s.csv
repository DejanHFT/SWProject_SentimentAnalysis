Found a penguin!! Need Help! ,mochacup,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/y7x4s/found_a_penguin_need_help/,1537,2311,"My kids just found a little penguin on our beach! 

We have called the local environmental agencies, but they will only be here tomorrow.

The poor little thing does not seem to be doing well.

Is there anything we can do until tomorrow?

The kids just named him Gunter  :-)

I am in the extreme south of the state of Bahia in Brazil. It is very rare to find penguins this up north, but this week alone, 3 washed up on the beaches. This is the first one that is alive. 

We are in a very small town, far away from any major cities, so there are no zoos or vets who can help around here. The people we called were not much help (it was the end of the day and the specialists were not in) but we were told that they will come by tomorrow. 

I would just like to know if any biologist here knew if there is anything we can do to help keep him comfortable (and alive) until tomorrow. Anything we can give it to eat? Where would he be most comfortable - in a cool place or not? He is not getting up, but he is moving a lot more now.

EDIT 2 - Gunter made it through the night!!! He is resting in his towels, and was following me around curiously with his little head when I walked in to check on him. He is sooooooo cute!! We checked him for dehydration and to see if his temperature was ok (as per instruction of a biologist specialized in penguins) and he seemed just fine). He drank and also ate a little. I called the people who will come and pick him up, and the good news is that instead of keeping him the small center until they had more animals for the trip, they will try to drive him off today to the really big center 4 hours north!!  I will take more pics before Gunter goes, and ask the people in the center to keep me updated. Thank you all for the help!!!

EDIT 3 - Gunter does not seem to be doing well at all!! :-(   :-(  He is not responding to when we walk in, and when we touch him, he does not move his head much. He is sleeping and his eyes are closed, but he is breathing heavily. I think he is dying... :-(   :-(   ARGH!! And they called saying they won't be here until the afternoon. It will be too late!! I did not want him to die here  :-( 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT 4- Well, maybe he was just sleeping really deeply? Because he woke up and ate TWO live little fish!! He was not interested with the dead stuff yesterday, but he gobbled up the live fish! He also had water!  I am afraid to hope, but how can I help it? Fight Gunter!!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT 5- They called again, and should be here soon.

Arrive already, Mrs. Biologist!
