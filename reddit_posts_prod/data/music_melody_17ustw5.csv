Help! Boygenius -Not Strong Enough melody???,GnrlPrinciple,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/17ustw5/help_boygenius_not_strong_enough_melody/,3,1,"Pleeaaaase help me figure out what the Boygenius Not Strong Enough melody sounds like (not the Sheryl Crow inspo). 

Not the chorus. 

Maybe 80’s 90’s indie pop/rock where each melody is followed by , “o-oo-o-ooO” 

“Something something something something  sooomething o-oo-ooOh!”

“Something something something something  sooomething o-oo-ooOh!”"
