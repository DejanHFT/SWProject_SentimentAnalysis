Why does it seem like many historically acclaimed writings geared for the working class are more thoughtful than modern day writings?,LiveAndLetTrade,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/58fh8r/why_does_it_seem_like_many_historically_acclaimed/,425,2350,"As you know, many great writings ex. The federalist papers, communist manifesto were written to working class people. I feel most people today could not read and understand these works (among others).  Also, I can't think of any wide spread thoughtful writings published today's world. Is this just a complex that is always felt living in the present? Or is the public truly becoming less thoughtful and only functionally literate?

Edit: thanks for all the great responses. There seems to be some confusion   Yes, both of these works were intended for the working class. Marxs purpose of writing the manifesto was for the greatest distribution possible. That's why it's his shortest and least philosophical work--least philosophical by far, too. There seems to be less debate of the federalist papers. They were published in news papers. Yes, while not everyone was literate, those who were most likely read the paper. Conversely, most people Today  do not read the paper. So, per capita readership might even be might have been higher then. "
