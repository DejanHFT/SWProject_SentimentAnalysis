How quick was travel in Western Europe in the late 1800s?,hdhdhgfyfhfhrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/s1keve/how_quick_was_travel_in_western_europe_in_the/,48,219,"I am listening to the audiobook of Dracula and the travel times were a bit eye-opening to me. I know the world had shrunk a bit by 1897 when the book came out but I think I was still believing that travel times were a more lengthy ordeal. Was travel by steam engines that available and affordable?

For example, Van Helsing is popping back and forth to London and Whitby in England to/from Amsterdam. He makes this trip in a turn around of under 24 hours at times. At one point Mina leaves England, sails to Hamburg, and then heads to Budapest. The time based on her letters/journal escape me but it was not overly long, or as long as I would have thought.

Not trying to be exclusionary asking about Western Europe, any examples of travel times in that era would be interesting to see.
