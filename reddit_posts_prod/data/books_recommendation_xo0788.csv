So many people recommended Piranesi to me,onelass,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xo0788/so_many_people_recommended_piranesi_to_me/,109,1145,"It’s almost midnight where I live. From the moment I picked up the book 5 hours ago to now I feel like half an hour has passed. I took three sips from my glass of wine and then set it down - forgotten.

I went in blind. I thought, I‘d have a relaxing sunday evening after a hell of a week… oh boy did I not know what I was getting myself into.

About halfway in, I began to understand glimpses of the bigger picture and even though I was intrigued from the very first sentence on, now my curiosity was burning. I HAD TO KNOW what was going on. What and where is the house? Who is the narrator?

Every page that half satisfied my hunger for more also left me wanting, and so I read on. And on and on and on until I was done. 

My husband has gone to sleep two hours ago, and I didn’t manage more than a „yes me too“ when he went to bed and told me he loved me, not even looking up from the pages. Sorry, love, for the gross neglectance. And sorry my beautiful pinot noir that I was so looking forward to and then simply forgot. You both deserved better.

But I needed to know. I had to continue. There was no stopping this train. 

I thank you all for asking me to read this book. And if you haven‘t: I kept it spoiler-free on purpose, because please read this astonishing work of art!

Thank you for reading my rant. I am utterly floored."
