Achieved my biggest success today!,Mswolfman,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1n92f7/achieved_my_biggest_success_today/,23,68,"A year ago I started working out and it's been a turbulent journey with various injuries and defeats.

But today I achieved something I never thought possible: I ran my first 5k race and finished in 31:52 minutes! 

It might not be much to some, but for me it's the start of everything. I am going to train and train and train until the next run (annual run sponsored by my uni) and then beat my time and go for the gold :) 

Just really wanted to share my joy of accomplishing this with you guys! "
