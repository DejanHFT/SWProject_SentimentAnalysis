I want to start planning Thanksgiving.. wanna keep it simple and delicious. Nothing stressful just delicious comfort food.,makeupyourworld,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/j8ebar/i_want_to_start_planning_thanksgiving_wanna_keep/,39,25,"I’m thinking I really want to do a Cidar-Glazed Turkey this year, with herbed butter under the skin and finished with an apple cider and butter glaze on the skin. Cranberry sauce is a must, Mom’s recipe of course (3 ingredients, 1 bag fresh cranberries, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup water). Simmer til all the berries burst. This is the first thing i ever remember cooking (she just let me stir the pot when i was around 4?) Brussel Sprouts roasted with Bacon, as it’s just out of this world. Some good ‘ole stuffing, with chicken stock, cubed bread, poultry seasoning, onions, celery.. Mmm. And a potato. Everyone loves a mash but I’m a roasted gal all the way. Hopefully we can agree on roasted. My family loves my mashed potatoes but i hate em! Even last year people finished em off and I was like why dont i like mashed potatoes? Slow roasted potatoes and onions are my heaven on earth. Mom and I’s tradition is to roast extra turkey necks since it’s our favorite part. We roast like 6 or 7 and munch on them before dinner and the next day. My mom’s sweet potato casserole too of course. She uses yams, pineapple, white sugar, cinnamon, marshmallows. Goodness it is bizarre looking (kind of ugly LOL!) but man its AMAZING. 

Dessert.. hmm. I’m a savory gal but I’m thinking a make ahead dessert like a classic cheesecake would be heavenly. How’s everything sounding? We are more of a honeyglazed ham family but its hard to time it out with turkey, and we do ham often. Whats everyone planning? We have a small family (3 of us), may have a friend or 2 over so it would be 5 or 6 max. But we like leftovers and send friends home with leftovers. What is everyone planning this year? Best wishes to u all. Hoping for a good holiday thats stress free. Normally spend the whole thing worried about trying to exercise and dont want to stress this year."
