Hey Reddit.....Please help me come up with a suitable punishment for my teenagers.,Mish61,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/euy0q/hey_redditplease_help_me_come_up_with_a_suitable/,2928,796,"Ok so the wife and I go out last night and came home a little early. Low and behold we find a teen party at our house. Cars lining a usually empty street, stumbling kids coming down our driveway and 30-40 teenagers in our back yard smoking and drinking alcohol. The inside of the house has another 10-20 and the place is looking pretty trashed. Everything is cleaned up now and no one (that we know of) got popped for DUI or hurt. We have 4 co-conspirators ages 15-20 all equally guilty in our minds.

So what punishment fits the crime reddit ?  We will dole out the most creative and who know maybe post pix later.

Edit...Downvotes ??   Really ??

Edit...in a way, them knowing that 'the internet' is determining their fate is punishing. Thanks for your suggestions !  

**Final Edit** - Oh Reddit. I used to love to hate you and now I hate to love you. Sniff. I've decided that the punishment will be for us to sit as a family and for the kids to take turns reading your suggestions aloud and choosing from any actual consequence you came up with. Not only will they get a glimpse into the possible consequences and punishments but I feel we will have fun and come together in the process. The best part is that none of this will come from Dad and Mom. Special thanks to Hamakua for planting the seed, and to all of you for being part of my evil scheme. I'm such a dick.....Muuuuaaaaa....haahaahaa. "
