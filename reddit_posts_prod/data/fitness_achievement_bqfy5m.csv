can i achieve much with 20kg dumbbells at home?,RIPTemperr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/bqfy5m/can_i_achieve_much_with_20kg_dumbbells_at_home/,28,13,"i’m relatively new to lifting and don’t have access to a gym but got a pair of dumbbells that can go up to 10kg each, which isn’t much but i have minimal experience. so is it better to do body weight exercises or shall i do a dumbbell plan. i looked on the wiki too but i also don’t have a bench for some exercises

my goal is to basically recomp. build muscle and lose some fat"
