What historical person do you have beef with?,ThePaperSolent,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/4b9h4v/what_historical_person_do_you_have_beef_with/,245,65,"I have a thing with Alexander III of Macedon because I think he was a generally terrible person, invading other people, trying to take over the world.
