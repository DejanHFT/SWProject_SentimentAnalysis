recommendation for party strategy / survival RPG?,KushKenobi,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10tzyf0/recommendation_for_party_strategy_survival_rpg/,4,2,"I've been really into top-down strategy rpgs lately such as mount and blade, total war, xcom/xenonauts. 

I really want to find a game like Kenshi, but I don't think I could tolerate the art style of that game enough to play it. 

I basically want something with a lot of variety and more intimate with strategy and progression."
