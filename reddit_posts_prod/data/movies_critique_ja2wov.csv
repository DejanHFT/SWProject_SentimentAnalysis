Robocop 2 (1990) is a worthy sequel.,EmilioEarhart,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ja2wov/robocop_2_1990_is_a_worthy_sequel/,93,91,"Paul Verhoeven's *Robocop* (1987) has long been one of my favorite movies - it's a violent, satirical masterpiece of science fiction filmmaking, full of memorable scenes and characters.

It goes without saying that the 1990 sequel isn't as good as the original, but the second installment did an honorable job of keeping with the *feel* of Verhoeven's work - the ultraviolence, the social critiquing.

It's a worthy follow-up."
