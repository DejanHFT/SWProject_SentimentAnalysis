Turning a bedroom into a gaming room/inside of a space ship. Is this achievable? [PICS],silentpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/11fae6/turning_a_bedroom_into_a_gaming_roominside_of_a/,23,24,"Here's the concept.

I want to create a room that looks [like this](http://imgur.com/a/EHK3F).

The panels would be made of styrofoam covered probably in vinyl or fake leather (suggestions welcome). As most modules would be light I plan on gluing them to the ceiling/wall and the storage unit modules would be custom built. 

The room is to look like the inside of a space ship with the projector showing an [orbital view of Earth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG0fTKAqZ5g&t=14) or flying through space. Kind of [like it's shown here](http://i.imgur.com/JkSzr.jpg) though on a smaller scale

The windows would have roller blinds with blackout fabrics. 

Would 6-8 weekends be enough to finish the project?"
