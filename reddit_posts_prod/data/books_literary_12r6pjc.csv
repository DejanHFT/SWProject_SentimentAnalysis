Literary Fiction - Why aren't there any series?,GentlyTurning,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12r6pjc/literary_fiction_why_arent_there_any_series/,76,0,"It seems to me that while genre fiction thrives on sequels and series, literary fiction, almost by definition, does not, even when the authors write many books. 
Can you imagine fantasy without at least a trilogy like Lord of the Rings or Wheel of Time? Mystery has Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Periot, Kinsey Millhone, and countless others. Romance has the Bridgertons, the Princess Diaries,, Westerns have the Sacketts etc., etc.

One the other hand I am hard pressed to think of any literary fiction that has sequels. I think Barbara Kingsolver has one or two sequels, but in general this type of fiction doesn't seem to want to repeat itself.

Is this so? Does art reject imitation, while entertainment encourages it?"
