"Found an interesting insight into history, and a rather unfortunate prediction... [ England, early 20thC ]",The3rdWorld,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/xvmfw/found_an_interesting_insight_into_history_and_a/,5,52,"Just [proof-reading an old book for Project Gutenberg](http://www.pgdp.net/c/) and came across this unfortunate prediction; he's talking about popular designs of horse brasses and their 'modern' use by motorists...

>The brass mascot used in every form, large and
small, by motorists and worn by many others so
extensively is the ""Swastika"" of Buddhist fame,
traceable in its varied form to Egyptian and other
early nations. These mascots in brass, made in
thousands to-day, are brass curios in the making;
possibly in a century or so they may be classed with
the oldest brass amulets described in this chapter,
and so add to the metal relics to be collected by
future curio-hunters!

Kind of crazy to think that cars in England frequently has a Swastika on the front grill pre-'30's - does anyone have a picture of one, or of an example of the brasswork?

also his comment on these brasses is actually a really interesting little insight into the fading away of a tradition, this section explains more (and comes just before the previous one)
  
>The amulet or charm is not altogether banished at
the present day. It has been worn at the watch
chain, round the neck, on a bangle, and suspended
from the chatelaine or the girdle. The greater use
of the road by motorist and cyclist has once more
brought into prominence the amulet or mascot,
carried in front of the rider. The river-girl places
a mascot on the prow of her boat, and the aviator
screws his mascot into position ""for luck."" Why
this should be done we cannot tell; the general belief
is in some mysterious advantage from the presence
of the mascot--an accepted theory by the sceptical
man who shakes his head and secretly marvels at
the folly of the belief.
  
The Horse Brass had been used as a magical ward against the 'evil eye' and bad luck since Celtic times, if not longer - many of the symbols trace right back to protociverlizations of the east.  Here in a world only just realizing it was inexorably changed by the technology it had created we see the lingering traditions of the old-world now mostly irrelevant but not yet forgotten; very much like the horse cavalry who'd be facing off against the German machine-guns the very year which the book was written, no doubt proudly displaying all kinds of antiquated finery.
