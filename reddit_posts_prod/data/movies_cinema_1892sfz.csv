Vaping in Cinema,Mennosforth,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1892sfz/vaping_in_cinema/,55,0,"I can't help but notice the absence of vaping in cinema, especially considering its increasing popularity in real life. Given that smoking in cinema has a long tradition of conveying meaning, it's interesting to observe the slow adoption of vaping. Do people think cinema will eventually depict vaping in a way that mirrors the symbolism we associate with smoking?"
