Wanna talk about the old “school kills the joy of learning”,gdjhsfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/gke9iw/wanna_talk_about_the_old_school_kills_the_joy_of/,46,13,"Background: I’m a 19yo female currently trying to get (the local version of a) GED after dropping  out of high school, with aims of becoming a sex education teacher.

I’m sure you’ve heard this before and as education stakeholders I want to hear your opinions. Following paragraphs are my experience, you can skip them if you want.


 I grew up with Turkish public education which taught me next to nothing of value and I had extreme problems with real and perceived power abuse by teachers. I had bad anxiety at the time and the fact that they expected respect without giving it really bothered me and ended with dropping out. It overall felt like an incredibly oppressive environment where I was “less” and they could take my stuff or order me around and that along with the pressure caused me to not even enjoy the classes I liked. I was yelled at and threatened with police for not joining the national anthem ceremony.

People kept telling me I had to do math because “math is life” to the point they cancelled Gym for it but they always left it at that. They didn’t seem to have anything behind that statement themselves, when I asked they talked about daily calculations I can do on my phone now. Only this month in my bed watching videos did it occur to me that it’s actually the language of the universe. I find it beautiful now, but I’ve cried when I was younger because not even private classes could help me figure it out. Even now a part of me flinches when I look at numbers because of school. Physics? Might as well have been Chinese, now I look around me and find it in everything and it gives me joy, even if I don’t understand the fine details. History? Was full of propaganda, my own research enriched me. English? I learned this language on my own and still had to do worksheet even though I knew everything already. They told you what but never told you why. They took things that enrich you and made them dull."
