Emotional Cheating- Need Help/Support,Hum07270727,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12ule64/emotional_cheating_need_helpsupport/,11,0,"Me (39F) and my fianc√© (39M) have been together for about 4 years and have a 6 month old together. He had been through a bad divorce 2 years before meeting me. We had a long distance relationship for the first 2 years of dating. The story is his ex-wife would sporadically message him throughout the first year. Every 2-3 months he would tell me he received a random text from her, and replied but kept it light.

I told him that she is obviously fishing to see if he was single, and is not getting the hint. We would argue endlessly, and then drop it till the next time. Some of her messages were flirting, so I asked him to be more direct with her, but he said he felt bad for her. Eventually he deactivated his Facebook, and all messaging stopped. 

About a week ago, it came up after all this time. The conversation got heated and I asked to see the messages. Turns out, they were messaging nonstop for the whole year. I‚Äôm furious and completely betrayed. The messages were mostly conversations about their lives, with some flirting in between. They had a ‚Äúclosure‚Äù conversation at one point, and he told her his life was in a weird place, and that even though things would not be the same, he was going to put effort to move on. This was about 11 months into our relationship. 

I am going to try to work it out with him, but struggling with so many questions. Any suggestions on how to get past needing to know every detail? For example, I want to know why he even bothered telling me about a message every 2-3 months, if he was going to hide 80% of it. Or, am I second fiddle to her, even now? His answer is always vague, like he doesn‚Äôt remember most of this. He‚Äôs completely committed to working on it, and is pretty devastated himself. Help üòî

TL/DR! Fianc√© emotionally cheated with ex-wife our first year together. Need help getting past obsessive questions that have no answers"
