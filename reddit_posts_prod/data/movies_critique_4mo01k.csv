Do anyone else feel themselves get taken out a movie because you try analyze and critique it too much as you're watching?,ItspronouncedGruh-an,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4mo01k/do_anyone_else_feel_themselves_get_taken_out_a/,10,1,"I've noticed myself get taken out of movies a lot lately because I have a hard time stopping myself from thinking too hard about what I think about the movie as I'm watching it, instead of just enjoying it spontaneously as it is happening.

It's as if I fancy myself a film critic and constantly try to think about what I would tell someone if they asked me about the movie.

Do anyone else feel they have this problem sometimes?"
