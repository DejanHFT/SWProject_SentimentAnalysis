How do I achieve this stain color... (or something similar),Royally_Recked,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/dhxb66/how_do_i_achieve_this_stain_color_or_something/,11,3,"I'm putting together a desk for my office with some 2x6's (pine). 

I'd like to give it a grey-ish top. 

When it comes to which colors to mix, or to wash out - I'm completely lost.   I've never been good with colors or tones, but know I'd like to achieve something *SIMILAR* (not exact) in color to the floor in [this photo](https://imgur.com/a/cYkzVeF).   


Any input as to where I should start, would be greatly appreciated!"
