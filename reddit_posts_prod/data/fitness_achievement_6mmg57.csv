Need advice on how to achieve a certain stretch.,gr00ve88,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6mmg57/need_advice_on_how_to_achieve_a_certain_stretch/,18,3,"I have a tight lower back/hip tilt.

I laid flat on my stomach and had someone basically sit on my hip to flatten it out.  Imagine it arches up a little if i'm laying flat.  It was kind of painful, but the relief I felt afterwards was amazing.

However, I don't know how I can achieve this stretch without another person.  I have bands and stuff, but I'm not sure if its possible to do.  Is there a way?

Enjoy my crude drawing of what i'm trying to achieve! http://imgur.com/a/Bkv2M"
