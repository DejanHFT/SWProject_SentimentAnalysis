Should I stay in one place or explore multiple countries?,Ta1kativ,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/x6bov9/should_i_stay_in_one_place_or_explore_multiple/,18,1,"I'm planning a **3-month** trip to France next year on a tight budget. I've been studying French for the past few months and am near to fluency. I always feel very rude whenever I visit a country without knowing the language. There are many places in Western Europe that I'd love to visit but that I've decided I should save for a future trip, once I know the language of the country. 

It seems that many people who take a long-term trip don't just stay in one country, and that's got me thinking about whether I should do the same. Would it be much more expensive to travel Western Europe by train, bus, and foot as opposed to staying in one city mainly? Is it better to plan stuff like this ahead or arrive and France and play it by ear? I'm new to doing this all on my own, so I'd appreciate any words of advice. Thanks!"
