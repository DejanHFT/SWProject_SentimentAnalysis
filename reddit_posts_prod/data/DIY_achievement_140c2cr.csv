Restricting flow safely on a transfer pump,Psych0matt,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/140c2cr/restricting_flow_safely_on_a_transfer_pump/,20,22,"Long story short I’m using a transfer pump as a makeshift pool heater, running it through about 100’ of 3/4” black irrigation tubing in the sun. It’s working well, but I’m running into the issue where it’s just going too fast to be effective. I thought about reducing it somewhere to restrict flow (at rhe outler would be easiest) so it moves slower allowing more time to heat up, or the other idea being to get a plug in dimmer to restrict the power so that it moves slower basically achieving the same outcome. I’m just wondering if there’s any other ideas that I hadn’t thought of that could work as well or better for longevity, not to mention not burning up the pump haha thanks guys!

More info: this is just to try and help raise the temp a bit for comfort, fresh water was just added and it was probably below 60° yesterday, but it’s been in the mid 80s so it’ll eventually warm up on its own. I figured this would just help get it there sooner, it’s not a necessity for using it, the kids wouldn’t care if it was near freezing!"
