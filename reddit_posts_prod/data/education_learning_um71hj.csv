"What is ""whole child"" learning?",tssouthwest,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/um71hj/what_is_whole_child_learning/,22,34,"There are a ton of buzzwords in our community but ""whole child"" seems to be an emerging trendy one.  A [news report](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/national-survey-teachers-believe-whole-100000150.html) today claimed that ""**91% of teachers believe students perform better when schools prioritize whole child learning**""........but doesn't that just mean that educators think students do better when educators have the time to get to know each and every student? Connecting with students to do well academically has kinda been the goal of academics, right?"
