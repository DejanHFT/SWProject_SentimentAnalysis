Name of ceiling texture?,oneoftwoleft,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/156yu7b/name_of_ceiling_texture/,5,1,"First time painting over a stain/blemish in my ceiling and want to match the texture pattern. Any idea what this texture pattern is called, and/or how to mimic it? I saw a video of spraying orange peel texture and spreading it flat but I'm not sure how to achieve these discrete flower shapes. Thanks
