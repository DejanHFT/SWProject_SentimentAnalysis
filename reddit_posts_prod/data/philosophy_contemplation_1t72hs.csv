"Unofficial Beyond Good & Evil Reading Group week the fifth: ""The Natural History of Morals""",NeoPlatonist,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1t72hs/unofficial_beyond_good_evil_reading_group_week/,6,14,"I hope everyone had a nice interlude and did well on their finals. We resume our study of Beyond Good & Evil with what is perhaps the most difficult chapter of all of Nietzsche’s works: The Natural History of Morals. Do not mistake this chapter for Nietzsche’s subsequent work, “The Genealogy of Morals”, which shall be the object of our next reading group.

Nietzsche begins chapter 5 with a brief critique of what he calls the “Science of Morals” or “the collection of material, the comprehensive survey and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worth, and distinctions of worth, which live, grow, propagate, and perish…as preparation for a THEORY OF TYPES of morality.” Clearly, Nietzsche is making one of the earliest investigations into meta-ethics. He distinguishes himself from other philosophers that “concerned themselves with morality as a science” by pointing out that they sought only to give morality a BASIS while Nietzsche has other activities in mind, viz: “How far from their awkward pride was the seemingly insignificant problem of a DESCRIPTION of forms of morality!” Philosophers hitherto “…did not even come in sight of the REAL problems of morals - problems which only disclose themselves by a comparison of MANY kinds of morality. In every “Science of Morals” hitherto, strange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself has been OMITTED” and “that which philosophers called giving a basis to morality has proved merely a learned form of good FAITH in prevailing morality, a new means of its EXPRESSION.”

N makes a brief mention of Schopenhauer, who he argues was not REALLY a pessimist because he ACTUALLY played the flute…daily after diner…one may read about it in his biography… Brought up under the NeoKantians, N turns immediately to the categorical imperative:
“Apart from the value of such assertions as ‘there is a categorical imperative in us’ one can always ask: What does such an assertion indicate about him who makes it? There are systems of morals which are meant to justify their author in the eyes of other people; others are meant to tranquilize him and make him self-satisfied; others he wants to crucify and humble himself…take revenge…conceal himself…glorify himself…and so on. This system helps its author to forget, that system makes him forgotten. Many a moralist would like to exercise power and creative arbitrariness over mankind.” Here N ties the activity of moral system-building as just another expression of the will to power. “What Kant gives us to understand by his morals is that ‘what is in me worth of esteem is that I know how to obey - and with you it SHALL NOT be otherwise than with me!’ In short, systems of morals are only a SIGN-LANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS.” Here we see expressed, as MacIntyre argues, N’s own meta-ethical position (or at least one of his positions - it can be argued he expressed many) of EMOTIVISM, which the meta-ethical belief that moral/ethical propositions express feelings of approval or disapproval and absolutely nothing else.

N then argues that “Every system of morals is a sort of tyranny against nature and also against reason.” But that this is no objection “unless one should again decree by some system of morals that all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful.” We see here that N is NOT NECESSARILY OPPOSED to all or any system of morals. He will spend a good part of this chapter arguing how employing various systems of morals can be and have been INSTRUMENTAL . He argues that what is essential and invaluable in every system of morals is that it is a “long constraint”. We shall see what he means by this.
N criticizes the anarchists and socialists of his day who were against any form of tyranny, or in their own words “no gods nor masters”. “The long bondage of the spirit,” he writes, “the distrustful CONSTRAINT in the communicability of ideas, the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think in accordance with the rules of a church or a court, or conformable to Aristotelian premises, the persistent spiritual will to interpret everything that happened according to a Christian scheme, and in every occurrence to rediscover and justify the Christian God: all this violence, arbitrariness, severity, dreadfulness, and unreasonableness, has proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the European spirit has attained its strength, its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility.” Systems of morality TRANSFORM the will to power, educating it and sharpening it.

“Thou must obey some one, and for a long time; OTHERWISE thou wilt come to grief, and lose all respect for thyself - this seems to me to be the moral imperative of NATURE, which is certainly neither categorical nor does it address itself to the individual (what does nature care for the individual!) but to nations, races, ages, and ranks; above all to MANKIND.”

In 190, N provides an analysis of the moral system of Plato, which argues “No one desires to injure himself, hence all evil is done unwittingly…the evil man would not do evil if he knew that evil is evil. The evil man therefore is only evil through error; if one free him from error one will necessarily make him good.” N writes, “This mode of reasoning savours of the POPULACE, who perceive ONLY the UNPLEASANT consequences of evil-doing and PRACTICALLY judge that it is STUPID to do wrong while they accept ‘good’ as identical with ‘useful and pleasant’ without further thought.

In 191, N confronts the ‘old theological problem of faith and knowledge’, which he reterms ‘instinct and reason’, and asks which deserves more authority? He examines Socrates, who he labels an ironist, stating that in his method Socrates first takes the side of reason and through dialectics discovers “the awkward incapacity of the noble Athenians (who were men of instinct, like all noble men) to give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions.” Socrates then says to himself, “But why should one on that account separate oneself from the instincts! One must set them right, and the reason ALSO, one must follow the instincts but at the same time persuade the reason to support them with good arguments!” **N is careful to point out here that Socrates was not being serious, that in fact he ‘perceived the irrationality in the moral judgment’**. N then writes that Plato however (and N is careful to distinguish the real Socrates from Plato’s representation of him) ‘wished to prove himself’ and so argued with ‘the greatest strength a philosopher had ever expended’ that ‘reason and instinct lead spontaneously to one goal, to the good, to God and that ever since in matters of morality instinct has triumphed - with the exception of Descartes, the father of rationalism, who recognized only the authority of reason (which N then argues is only a tool and Descartes superficial)’. 

In 192, N asks us to investigate the history of any single science and that we will find in its development a process common to all knowledge and cognizance that, therefore, will be reflected in our science of morals, viz that ‘our sense learn late and never learn completely to be subtle, reliable, and cautious organs of knowledge’. “Our eyes find it easier on a given occasion to produce a picture already often produced, than to seize upon the divergence and novelty of an impression: the latter requires more force, more ‘morality’. It is difficult and painful for the ear to listen to anything new; we hear strange music badly. Our senses are hostile and averse to the new and generally, even in the ‘simplest’ processes of sensation, the emotions DOMINATE.” Here N is developing a very early conception of cognitive bias, wherein our beliefs and values distort our perceptions and prohibit us from integrating new information that is counter to the beliefs and values we currently hold. He continues his foray into psychology writing that “Even in the midst of the most remarkable experiences, we fabricate the greater part of the experience and can hardly be made to contemplate any event except as inventors thereof. All this goes to prove that from our fundamental nature and remote ages we have been accustomed to lying, or to express it more politely and hypocritically, in short, more pleasantly - **one is much more of an artist than one is aware of.**”

N spends the next few sections investigating the fictions we construct for ourselves, then how they relate to romance, concluding that, “Only then does he feel the beloved fully in his possession, when she no longer deceives herself about him, when she loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealed insatiability, as for his goodness, patience, and spirituality. One man would like to possess a nation, and he finds all the higher arts of Cagliostro and Catalina suitable for his purpose. Another, with a more refined thirst for possession, says to himself: **One may not deceive where one desires to possess’** - he is irritated and impatient at the idea that a MASK of him should rule in the hearts of the people. ‘I must, therefore, MAKE myself known, and first of all learn to know myself!”

“Among helpful and charitable people, one finds the awkward craftiness which first gets up suitably him who has to be helped, as though he should ‘merit’ help, seek just THEIR help, and would show himself deeply grateful, attached, and subservient to them for all help. With these conceits they take CONTROL of the needy as a PROPERTY, just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a desire for property. One finds them jealous when they are crossed or forestalled in their charity. Parents involuntarily make something like themselves out of their children -**they call that ‘education’**; no mother doubts at the bottom of her heart that the child she has borne is thereby her property, no father hesitates about his right to HIS OWN ideas and notions of worth. Indeed, in former times fathers deemed it right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly born. And like the father, so also the teacher, the class, the priest, and the prince still see in every new individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession.”

In 199, N states that there have always been human herds (family alliances, communities, tribes, peoples, states, churches) and always a great number who obey in proportion to the small number who command. That “the herd-instinct of obedience is transmitted best and at the cost of the art of command. If one imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent, commanders and independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether, or they will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience and will have to impose a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to command just as if they also were only obeying. This condition of things actually exists in Europe at present - I call it the moral hypocrisy of the commanding class. They know no other way of protecting themselves from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executors of older and higher orders (of predecessors, of the constitution, of justice, of the law, or of God himself) or they even justify themselves by maxims from the current opinions of the herd, as ‘first servants of their people’.”

“On the other hand, the gregarious European man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the only kind of man that is ALLOWABLE, he glorifies his qualities such as public spirit, kindness, deference, industry, temperance, modesty, indulgence, sympathy, by virtue of which he is gentle, endurable and useful to the herd, as the peculiarly human virtues.”

In 201: “As long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only gregarious utility, as long as the preservation of the community is only kept in view, and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in what SEEMS dangerous to the maintenance of the community, there can be no ‘morality of love to one’s neighbor’…After all, love to our neighbor is always a secondary matter, partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to our FEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR…How much or how little dangerousness to the community or to equality is contained in an opinion, a condition, an emotion, a disposition, or an endowment - that is now the moral perspective, here again FEAR IS THE MOTHER OF MORALS.” It may be said that here lies the grandest of ironies, as N has laid out for us a BASIS of morals. “If one could do away with danger, the cause of fear, one would have done away with morality at the same time, it would no longer be necessary.”

The remainder of the chapter, from 202 on, is N’s criticism of socialists and progressives. It is very complex and this post is already too long. It needs to be said that N believes that the objective of the progressives is ‘undoubtedly POSSIBLE’ but warns against it, as he believes it means ultimately opposition to EVERY right, for when all are equal, no one needs ‘rights’ any longer.

DISCUSSION: Are you at all swayed by N’s arguments that real progress requires a bit of tyranny, discipline, obedience, and inequality? Do you agree with N that the (to him) so-called progressives are in fact misguided?
