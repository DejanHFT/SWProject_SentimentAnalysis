Motivation,neonrose2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1kf86c/motivation/,13,1,"I posted on this sub some months ago and since then a lot has change since then. Eventually things slowly went back to how it used to be but not has bad. I changed something that has set me back very much. My eating habits. Now I (sometimes) cook my own food which consists of protien(chicken breast)/carbs(brown rice)/nutrition(mushrooms/broccoli). But then I lost my way. NOW I'M BACK. I feel it again.

When I started my workout routine and started eating healthy, I had the mentality of ""If it doesn't help my gains, it will only cause me pains."" But I lost that mentality along with everything I was working towards...I lost all motivation. After eating some beef jerky and fat snacks(Reeses) I suddenly feel super motivated again. I don't know what it was but I hope it stays. What helps motivate you, if anything?

P.S. Sorry if this isn't the right sub, it just seems like it was."
