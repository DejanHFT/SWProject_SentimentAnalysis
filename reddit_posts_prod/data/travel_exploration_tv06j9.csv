How can I explore the world?,undefeated36,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/tv06j9/how_can_i_explore_the_world/,20,3,"I always dreamed to explore the world, but I don't know where and how to start. I'm still 20/F and I have a strict parents, I live in an Asian household which can be difficult to convince my family that I want to travel on my own and just be independent. I feel like a bird in a cage that urging to get out of it and see the world I never seen in my life and places I have only seen on the internet. I just have this burning desire to always be on the go and to not settle for anything. I'm in university and it bores me already and thinking then I have to get a job after, I just don't want such a life. Passion means everything to me, I can't force myself to do something I don't want to do, none of these day to day activities fit me, and my passion is to explore the world but I don't know where and how to begin the journey."
