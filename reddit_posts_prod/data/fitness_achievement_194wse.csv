"Stance on Tough Mudder, Spartan Race, etc...",manoli_e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/194wse/stance_on_tough_mudder_spartan_race_etc/,312,254,"What're you're opinions here on /r/fitness on all these obstacle courses and events that seem to be the big thing now? 

I've always wanted to do one, but it seems like as I look into them, they're not all they're cracked up to be. I know only a few people who have actually participated in one, and they told me how it was easy because they allowed you to skip obstacles and cut through the event, which took away some of the achievement in my eyes, and of course the website and /r/Toughmudder would say that that doesn't happen and that it really is a huge achievement, but I figured I'd get a less biased response here. 

Also, what are the main differences between all of them as far as the difficulty, rules, fitness level required? "
