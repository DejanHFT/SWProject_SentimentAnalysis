Hunting is an Objective Moral Good,steph-anglican,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/kqo6qf/hunting_is_an_objective_moral_good/,39,0,"I should perhaps begin this argument by admitting that it is based on reading, observation and thought, not direct experience of hunting.

As with all discussions of morality, one must begin with a meta-ethical inquiry. Before we can say what is good for an entity, we must ask what it is, what is its nature. In the case of humans, the normally given answer is that we are rational animals and I will certainly be using that definition in this essay. However, in this context it is important to say that we more than just rational animals, we are a specific type of animal that is rational. Our ancestors for tens of thousands of generations were cursorial hunters, that is chase predators.

Further it should be noted that there is a deep relationship between our nature as cursorial hunters and the existence of our rationality. It was because our ancestors were able to consume foods rich in fat and protein that they were able to develop a nutritionally expensive organ like our large brain constituting only 2 percent of our body mass but consuming 25 percent of the calories we eat. An organ that allows us to contemplate the nature of the good.

So, it might seem that to ask the question, is hunting good and to define your terms, is to answer it. Man is a hunter by nature and its good is obviously to live in accord with its nature. I do believe I could stop here, but for so variable a creature as man, there are many questions and objections that might arise.

Perhaps this the time to address the fact that there are at least four types of hunting that many people view differently: management (sometimes called therapeutic) hunting, subsistence hunting (hunting for food), protective hunting, and trophy hunting. I want to deal with all of these, but to continue our inquiry I want to begin with the morality of hunting for food.

For every living creature its life and that of its offspring is its highest value. For humans who must produce food so that they can live, food production is one of its highest goods. While agriculture is the main way we produce our calories today, hunting is certainly one of the ways we produce food and is therefore a good.

Closely related is the hunting of pest animals. Either predators that want to eat our livestock or consume our crops. Since the production of food is a high order good, this form of hunting is also justified.

As rational creatures one of the ways we ensure our survival is by transforming landscapes to better suit our purposes. From clearing forests for fields and pastures to produce food to building villages, towns and cities. So naturally enough we even try to manage the area’s we keep relatively wild. One way we do this is to use hunting to keep the population of pray animals in check since we have eliminated most of the other predators that would normally do so. So, to the degree that we think managing prey populations to prevent unnecessary suffering from starvation and the like is good, then hunting for population management is good.

The first thing to note about trophy hunting is that trophies of the hunt: antler knife hilts, lucky rabbit’s feet, clothes made from the skins, and yes racks or heads on the wall are perfectly appropriate in themselves, if the purpose of the hunt is otherwise justified. After all, to hunt and kill a deer, to take one example, is an impressive accomplishment and to display part of it as form of bragging is not necessarily wrong. Further to the extent the trophy use is practical, it constitutes reduction of waste. All waste is ethically questionable and to reduce waste is good. The problem would come if the trophy was the only use made of the animal and the rest wasted. This is especially the case with the higher animals.

By now I can almost hear people say that I am missing the point. What, about the suffering of the animals. The answer to that is threefold. (not in order of importance)

First, it is not clear that ending human hunting would reduce animal suffering. In the absence of hunting all animals would die due to predation, accident, starvation and old age. Anyone who has seen films of a lion or a pack of wolves literally eating their prey whilst it is still living, knows that modern human hunters are merciful by comparison. Likewise, disease, which is fundamentally a form of predation, is not kinder than a bullet. Accidents if immediately lethal might be no worse than a human hunter, but if it leads to extended pain followed by death by starvation it certainly is. Death from starvation due to population pressure is not a painless way to go. As for old age, most animals die of old age by weakening to the point of falling prey to one of the forgoing.

Second, while suffering is bad, harm reduction is not a viable central moral principal even when applied to humans. While we should not desire to suffer and we should not wantonly inflict suffering on other humans, human life, flourishing and happiness is the central ethical value.

Third, I do not consider humans and other animals of the same moral value. Humans, in general, are valuable to me in ways that animals are not. Because we are a social species, we have an inclination to work together, share values, and to make ourselves useful to one another in a way that most animals do not. (I am not going to go into the status of pets here)

So, when a human good comes into conflict with the good of another animal, the human good must prevail. This is clearly the case when it comes to food, clothing, and shelter. But even lesser human values can and usually should prevail.

In that context, it is interesting to note that the internet provides evidence that hunting makes young humans happy. If you search youtube for “father son hunting” or “my son/daughter’s first deer,” you will find that killing deer usually results in smiles, fist pumps, cheers, and verbal expressions of happiness, but somewhat frequently in a state that one could fairly label ecstasy. They need to be taught to hunt, but not to enjoy it.

Nor should this surprise us, we are the descendants of tens of thousands of generations of successful hunters.  It would be as strange for hunting not to make us happy, as it would be for us as mammals not to have love for our young."
