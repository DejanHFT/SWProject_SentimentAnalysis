"Describe kind, supportive sister actions.",dashindorie,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cjiqy1/describe_kind_supportive_sister_actions/,4,0,"My mega quick backstory:  Only child, frequent mover, distant mother, absent father. I am super bad at social interaction. If you recorded my actions and played them back slowly, you could point out each of the various characters of TV shows and movies that I've gathered and smiushed into a Frankenstein's monster-esque 'personality'. The impostor syndrome is real. Fortunately, my weirdo husband is into that and we've been cozy for a minute.

He has two siblings that I've watched grow up (BIL is 18, known since three). It is generally a very big family, everyone has at least a sibling or two. My SIL is getting married this year. She's just great. Her dude is just great. This feels like it should stand apart from aunt/ cousin/ mom weddings I feel like I have no actual orthodox interactions to pull from. What is the best way I can be the best sister for her at this life event? Or, like- if you were getting married, how could your sister enhance the experience?

TLDR: SIL is getting married. How can I be the best sister?"
