How to support my [23F] boyfriend's [24M] super annoying new hobby?,KindlyGoose,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/62b1jo/how_to_support_my_23f_boyfriends_24m_super/,177,591,"My long term (5 year) boyfriend has been wanting to play guitar since he was a kid. He just recently bought a guitar and is learning to play on his own. I'm really proud of him for taking this step and making himself practice, but, like most new musicians, he sounds awful. 

The guitar is loud, the apartment is small, and there is no escape when he decides to practice for an hour in the evening. His practice sessions are random, too, so I can't plan to be out of the house for a while.

  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend bought a guitar. I really want to support him, but practice is driving me up the wall. What can I do to encourage him but keep my sanity?

**Edit 1:** Wow, I had no idea my post would blow up so much. Thank you all for your input and encouragement! For a few FAQs, he is learning acoustic guitar, we are both college students, and the college won't let someone not in a music major (i.e. us) use the music rooms."
