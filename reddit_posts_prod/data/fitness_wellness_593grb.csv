"Do health and wellness products such as Advocare, Thrive, Herbalife, etc. have a place in the fitness world?",SandDuner509,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/593grb/do_health_and_wellness_products_such_as_advocare/,13,1,"Do these products actually work? Or are they temporary feel good products that only last as long as you're regularly using the product? What's the difference between products like these and those usually associated with the fitness world?

Quick fixes, such as a patch you wear to make you feel better, have always made me feel leery. You always hear about them when someone Is regularly using them, but what happens when you stop using them all together?"
