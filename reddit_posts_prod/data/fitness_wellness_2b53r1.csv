Well-rounded leg day?,londonmeanswild,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2b53r1/wellrounded_leg_day/,9,1,"So I've done some reading on fittit, but am not sure how to find exactly what I'm looking for. 

I'm doing Phrak's greyskull and have been seeing progress with my squats and deadlifts. However, my 'teardrop' muscle and my ass look great, while the back of my upper legs is noticeably lacking (according to my girlfriend). 

So, fittit, what can I add (within the structure of Phrak's GSLP, and working construction) to make my legs more even?"
