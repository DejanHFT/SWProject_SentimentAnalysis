"A reminder: Keep your fitness-related new year's resolutions to yourself and you'll be more likely to achieve them. Happy new year, fittit!",fatfuckery,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1u67lh/a_reminder_keep_your_fitnessrelated_new_years/,138,1394,"Here's a [link to an old TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself.html) briefly (~3 minutes) explaining the phenomenon. There's mention of this in the FAQ, but it bears pointing out this time of year. This advice applies to all your new year's resolutions and goals for 2014, too, not just fitness ones.

So go make some new year's resolutions, come up with realistic plans to achieve them â€” and then shut up about them!

Happy new year, fittit!"
