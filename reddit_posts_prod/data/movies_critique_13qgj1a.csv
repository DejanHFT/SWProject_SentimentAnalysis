I really want to include it as I love it however I would want to know if anybody agrees with this decision, thank you kindly, friends. 

I found the movie to be really philosophical actually as a whole, it presented the idea of life just going forward and its structures falling apart, being rebuilt, then burnt down and human life being banal, inconsequential and absurd, however that is far from the truth, as we can all become part of something bigger, of an idea, that remains, or we can be cockroaches that remain cynical and just critique others. 

Also about the human decadence, how they all so hypocritical during the Hollywood change into elegance, then back to where they began anyway. 

This is just my idea. 

Thank you kindly."
