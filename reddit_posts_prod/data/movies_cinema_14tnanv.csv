Best portrayals of violence in cinema,juggernautjames,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/14tnanv/best_portrayals_of_violence_in_cinema/,79,30,"I’ve always been attracted to how violence is shown in cinema, which I attribute to my parents letting me watch Paul Verhoeven films at a very young age and has ever since left a lasting impression. I’m not talking about the most violent movies, but rather moments of violence in movies that leave an impression.

In my opinion five filmmakers, alongside Verhoeven, are excellent at showcasing violence that stands out above the myriad of banal bloodshed that saturates cinema:

S Craig Zahler (Brawl in Cell Block 99, Dragged Across Concrete)

Jeremy Saulnier (Blue Ruin, Green Room)

Nicholas Refn Winding (Drive, Only God Forgives)

Park Chan-wook (The Vengeance Trilogy)

And finally David Cronenberg, particularly in his later films (Eastern Promises, A History of Violence). His portrayals definitely intrigue me the most because of how immediate and intense the moments are. And his direction makes them more impactful through the use of close ups and letting the camera linger on the aftermath longer than it should.

Also a special shout-out to ‘Wind River’ - that final shootout was so brutal and the interactions between the advisories felt so real in the moment.

Obviously this question is open to interpretation, so I’m curious to see what other people have to say."
