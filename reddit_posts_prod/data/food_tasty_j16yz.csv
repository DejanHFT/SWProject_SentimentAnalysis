I'm learning to love veggies - what are some tasty ways to eat them for breakfast?,cheesezombie,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/j16yz/im_learning_to_love_veggies_what_are_some_tasty/,56,17,"For most of my life, I hated the majority of vegetables. When I began to cook for myself and started focusing on eating healthier, I began to experiment in making veggie dishes that were more flavorful and palatable to me.

Luckily I've been decently successful and gained a newfound respect/love for vegetables. However I haven't really explored/found any good breakfast recipes to incorporate veggies, and I'd love to make something before work that is filling, tasty, and veggie-filled.

Can anyone recommend any recipes or dishes?"
