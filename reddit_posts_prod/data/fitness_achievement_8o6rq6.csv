ABS! How do I achieve them,AlexR6336,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8o6rq6/abs_how_do_i_achieve_them/,11,0,"I’m a guy, 19 years old, always had the unfortunate tendency to get fat around my lower body. I’m short as hell, 160lbs, but I’ve been working out lately, mostly upper body and some core. Dieting too, I’ve lost some fat doing that, trying to lower my calorie intake and focus on eating more protein and fruits and vegetables. I was wondering if I could get some tips on how to tone my stomach and chest, I’m having a pretty tough time. What kind of foods should I avoid and exercises I should do? I don’t always have access to a gym, so things I could do at home (I have a set of weights) would be great. "
