[24F][25M] Have been LDR for one year but his parents are not supportive of our relationship is it worth the move?,ThrowRA-tucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zwzu57/24f25m_have_been_ldr_for_one_year_but_his_parents/,2,1,"TLDR; boyfriends parents don't like me and are not supportive of our relationship, he is very close with them but it seems like keeping me around is putting a strain in their relationship as well. is it worth moving there if nothing changes?

my boyfriend (M25) and i (F24) have been in an LDR for the last year, although we have our ups and downs we've always been able to over come our differences and make it work in a healthy way. we've came to the conclusion that in the end i would move to where he is because his career and mine would thrive in his city.

but i do have reservations about moving there because his parents do not like me and do not support our relationship, it seems like his mom is overly attached to him and does not want any female influence in his life besides herself. my boyfriends ex has broken up for this reason and it seems to be a pattern. although his parents have not been malicious to me, they do not care to get to know me, always have something to say, and when i am around his family i am treated like i am not even present in the room. my boyfriend has tried standing up for me and has asked why they do not support our relationship but all his parents have said is that my lifestyle is not as active as my boyfriends and that it's not possible for my lifestyle to change. it is also clear that his mom wants someone who is of the same ethnicity, religion and someone as successful as my boyfriend as a partner for him -- i do not fit what she wants. this deeply hurts me for many reasons to name a few: whenever my boyfriend visits my city he is only showered by love and support by my family, i feel like no matter what i do i will never be good enough and i do not want to spend the rest of my life having my in-laws hate me or be at battle with them. although he has started to stand up for me and our relationship, it has also created created a barrier between the relationship between his parents and himself.

my boyfriend has a habit of always trying to make his parents happy and seeking for his moms validation, to the point where he did not have any boundaries with them before me. both him and i value family deeply but it seems like not everyone has a seat at his parents table, and knowing i won't have familial support moving to a new city makes me nervous. i have struggled for a long time with my mental health and it took me a very long time to build it back to where it is now, is it worth me leaving my life, my supportive and loving friends and family to move to his city?"
