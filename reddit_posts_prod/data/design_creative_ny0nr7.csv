How do I become an art/creative director?,friedchickenlicken,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/ny0nr7/how_do_i_become_an_artcreative_director/,6,2,"Hey everyone,

I'm an undergraduate student completing a BA in Media and Communications but my end goal is to become an art or creative director either for film or advertising (haven't decided). My degree is heavily focused on film, videography, video editing, writing etc, but I have been taking advertising, marketing and design classes on the side. I flipping love designing (i'm pretty good at Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) and have made a portfolio to show companies and agencies. Since then, I've done a social media and marketing internship and just have been accepted into a Jr Creative Producer internship. All my life I always thought I should be a producer or film/tv director, but my passion also lies with design. 

What are the steps would you guys recommend for me to achieve my dream? Or am I doomed to never become one in the future? What classes should I take to advance my skills? 

Please help me ouuuut!!"
