Recommendations for Headphones that work well with vigorous exercise?,haidruh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2993c8/recommendations_for_headphones_that_work_well/,21,3,"I am in the process of trying to get my weight under control, and I have found that listening to music really helps motivate me and keep my tempo up etc. (Obviously haha).  I have tried several styles of headphones but most do not work well for me.  The cheap earbud style with ear wrap-around (I have sonys) bounce off of my ear when I run.  The more expensive ones (also from sony) that have adjustable ear wrap-arounds unadjust themselves and I end up constantly having to adjust them.  The regular earbud style (I tried both the Apple style and the ""noise-cancelling"" rubber stick-in-your ear style) seem to slip out of my ear.  I have seen people wearing the larger full headset style (i.e. Beats) but I dont want to spend anymore money on experimentation without some recommendations.  Do I have mutant ears?  Does anybody else have this problem?  Has anyone found a good solution?  

Thanks for any replys ahead of time, let me know if this is not an appropriate topic for this subreddit (seems like the right target audience haha)."
