"My dad became paralyzed, my girlfriend not being supportive?",Present_5583,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ilsaw2/my_dad_became_paralyzed_my_girlfriend_not_being/,14,14,"I'm  31 and she's 29. First off, let me just say I recently discovered im a  codependent and I've been very consumed in my relationship with my  girlfriend. I can be needy, too sensitive, etc.

But  my dad, who is my best friend and business partner was in a car  accident a week ago and hit his head, has brain bleeding, and is  paralyzed on his left side. Only time will tell if he fully comes back.  I've been at the hospital for days coordinating everything. I've also  taken over his business in the meantime. Its been stressful. The first  two days my girlfriend was super super supportive and helped me so much.  Then she had to go back to work and basically became distant. Said that  she didnt think we should spend too much time together (we just got  back together after a break up about 2 weeks ago) I told her I partly  understood that but under the circumstances i didn't care i needed her  support right now.

The drill has  been i leave the hospital after a long day, i check in with her and see  how shes doing and if I feel shes being short or i feel shes being  distant, I'll either make the conversation short or tell her shes being  distant - both of those seem to produce fights. She'll come back and say  shes not being distant, etc.

I  need someone who's not gonna fight with me, or be distant in times like  these. I don't want to deal with trying to read if she wants to hang out  with me or not, I just want her to be there after a long day dealing  with this stuff.

I've told friends  about this and they say if shes being anything other than supportive  and loving towards you right now, you don't need to be hanging out with  her.

Am I asking for too much? Am I being too needy? Because I know that I can be.

TL;DR my girlfriend is being distant or am i being too needy?"
