"Historians of Reddit, if you could give one history book to a historical figure, what would the book be and who would you give it to?",AdmiralAtvar,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5egwts/historians_of_reddit_if_you_could_give_one/,396,475,I recently read a book on the winter war and wondered what Mannerheim (Finnish millitary commander) would have done differently with the book i was reading. So who do you guys think would be interesting to give a history book to?
