I [29 M] feel bad for how hard it is for me to be supportive to my gf [28 F],Alfa9414,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15qo4th/i_29_m_feel_bad_for_how_hard_it_is_for_me_to_be/,0,1,"What once was a relationship so full of love,  has become an entangled mess of miscomunications, resentment and lack of empathy. Honestly I feel heartbroken atm because I don't know how to handle the current situation and I end up being really awful to her. 

We've been together for 7.5 years now. Lost a baby. She had an affair around 2 years ago, and I chose to continue because I didn't want to leave things that bad, she agreed and we moved on. It's been good most of the time, we're working on doing the best we can. 

Nontheless, some issues from her childhood have brought our growth as a couple to a halt, and I've become resentful about it. And oh men, life is such a harsh master to follow... 

Out of nowhere evrything began to change  from one day to the other. 
1. Her mother lost her lifelong job.
2. Her father was diagnosed with cancer.
3. I got a new job on site. (Was doing home office, would see each other everyday) 

So... Life as we knew it has changed unexpectedly in just a couple of weeks. 
And well, I'm finding it very hard to be supportive on how bad the situation became for her, she's all stressed out, tired, sad, anxious, afraid and I have trouble being empathetic to her and I acted like an asshole today, and I couldn't stop thinking that it is all of the repressed resentment that's making me act like that. I ignored her at some moments, and made her feel more pressure about the changes we'll undergo. I don't want to be like that to her, I love her deeply and sincerely, but I don't know what to just be there with a smile on my face and open arms... And now I'm thinking of all the times that I was a bad person to her in the past.

We both have been to each other in different times and situations, there's been a balance with the good and the bad. 

I just want to be there for her, but with how stressful things have been lately, it's very hard...

There's a lot of context left out, I just wanted to write this somewhere to relieve some of the despise I feel about my behavior towards her today...

Any advice on what could I say or do to make things better? 

Tl;dr- Gf is having a rough time and I was an asshole."
