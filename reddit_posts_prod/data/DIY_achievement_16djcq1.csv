what is this cable? WI-FI EXTENSION HELP NEEDED (floor plan included in photos),throwawayguitar3-563,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/16djcq1,23,1,"i am trying to extend my grandparents wifi range into the guest room in the garden. the wifi router is in the front room (point A on the map photo).  can i use this cable somehow, i think it may be a coaxial cable but i am not sure. apparently there has been wifi in here before, but my grandparents do not know how to get it back. there is also a language barrier between us and i am having to communicate via translator apps so itâ€™s very difficult to share concepts and understanding. if anyone could give me a description of what i could do to achieve getting wifi in this room i would be very grateful."
