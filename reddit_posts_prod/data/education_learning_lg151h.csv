It is targeted to people with learning disabilities.  Are there any suggestions on what I should make??
I'm thinking of making a slant board. Is there any ways to make it more better catering for the people with learning disabilities?
My slantboard needs to be something very unique.
So any suggestions on how to make a really unique slant board?"
