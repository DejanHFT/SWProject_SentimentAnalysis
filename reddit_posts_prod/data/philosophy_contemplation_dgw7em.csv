A short discussion of philosophical questions surrounding Hong Kong (repost from r/academicphilosophy),EdisonCurator,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/dgw7em/a_short_discussion_of_philosophical_questions/,5,9,"While it is good that the online community is supporting Hong Kong's cries for democracy, I've noticed a lack of substantive discussion on issues surrounding Hong Kong's recent protests which certainly warrant deeper contemplation.

Here are the issues/questions I'd like to discuss:

Does China's sovereignty imply that other countries ought not to interfere with China's internal policies (such as those regarding Hong Kong and XinJiang)?

My short answer: No, there are some circumstances in which foreign interference is justified.

Do protesters in Hong Kong have a moral obligation to obey the laws of China? (specifically the anti-protesting laws)

My short answer: Probably not, due to doubts regarding whether the Chinese government have legitimacy over Hong Kong.

Does Hong Kong have a unilateral right to secede/become independent?

My short answer: Probably not. I'm not sure.

Before I go into the arguments, I think it's best to introduce myself. I am a Chinese student studying BPhil in philosophy at Oxford University. I've lived in the US and UK for the last 6 years, but I go back to China regularly. I don't have much background. in political philosophy. Nevertheless, I would like to offer my thoughts on the philosophical questions that I think arise in recent Hong Kong pro-democracy protests.

1 Does China's sovereignty imply that other countries ought not to interfere with China's internal policies (such as those regarding Hong Kong and XinJiang)?

This is an important issue to tackle because this is one of the most commonly made arguments by the Chinese government whenever government officials make comments about China's involvement in Hong Kong and XinJiang. However, this is also one of the most straightforward questions to answer. To some extent, international conventions are such that all states have external sovereignty, or a state's freedom from outside influence upon its basic prerogatives. This is why it would be improper for foreign governments to interfere with US elections because for a different state to interfere with the governance of the US is to violate the US government's external sovereignty. Similarly, for example, it would be improper for foreign governments to unilaterally influence China's economic policies on dairy products.

However, I think it is clear that external sovereignty ought to be limited. The best argument for this comes from Nazi Germany. It is clear to me that other states are not only justified to stop the holocaust, whether or not if happens within German territory, but they might even have a moral obligation to interfere in this instance.

Therefore it looks like, given certain atrocities are being committed, foreign interference is justified. Now, I am not saying that such atrocities are happening in Hong Kong or XinJiang. I don't know enough to say that. I am making the negative claim that China's sovereignty doesn't imply that other countries ought not interfere with its internal policies unconditionally.

2 Do protesters in Hong Kong have a moral obligation to obey the law of China? (specifically the anti-protesting laws)

A state's right to be obeyed should be tied to its legitimacy. It is clear that a tyrant doesn't have a moral right to be obeyed. There are three main proposed sources of legitimacy - A. consent; B. democratic approval; C. beneficial consequences.

Firstly, given that an estimated number of more than a million people from Hong Kong (with a population of 7.4 million) joined the protests for democracy. I think there is a good case to be made that Chinese rule in its current form would not get consent from the majority of people in Hong Kong. But I have a general problem with the consent as a source of legitimacy. It is simply not clear to me why people who haven't given consent (or wouldn't give consent even given ideal conditions) have a duty toward the state.

Secondly, there seems to be a good reason to believe that Chinese legitimacy cannot be derived from democratic approval since democracy is precisely what the protesters are fighting for.

Lastly, on the beneficial consequences front, I am not qualified to evaluate if China could have received legitimacy from this source.

But even with legitimacy, it is not clear if citizens of a state have an obligation to follow unjust laws. Again, it seems clear that Nazi soldiers do not have an obligation to follow orders to send Jews to concentration camps. I am, however, not sure if the laws in China are unjust enough to warrant non-compliance.

3 Does Hong Kong have a unilateral right to secede/become independent?

A tempting idea is that if most people who live in Hong Kong desire independence, then they ought to have a right to become independent. But I don't think this is true.

I assume that China has a territorial right to Hong Kong and XinJiang. Given this, and the fact that the stateâ€™s territory is popularly 'conceived of as the territory of the people as a whole, not just those who at a particular time happen to reside in a portion of it' (from the SEP article on secession), it seems like the mere fact that the majority of people who reside in an area desire independence is not sufficient for them to have a claim for the territory. For example, a neighborhood in London could not simply take a vote and proceed to declare independence.

Popularly, a right to secede is thought to require persistent injustice done to the group of people in question. Now, one might argue that people in Hong Kong have enjoyed a relatively high amount of freedom and it is not clear if China has perpetrated enough injustice to the Hong Kong people for them to have a right to secede. Although some of the recent events involving the Hong Kong police might be seen as injustices. But I am not sure if they are worse than the persistent injustice the police in the US have perpetrated upon African Americans.

However, if the reports on a million Uighurs being imprisoned in XinJiang is true, then there seems to be good reason to believe that people in XinJiang have suffered sufficient injustice to gain a right to independence."
