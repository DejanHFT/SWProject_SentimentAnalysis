Is it possible for current human technology to destroy ALL life on Earth?,brwilliams,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/faqhm/is_it_possible_for_current_human_technology_to/,53,34,"I understand that destroying all complex life seems very possible. However with so many extremophile bacteria that live in places like ocean vents and below arctic ice it seems unfathomable to me that destroying ALL life would be possible even with the destructive power of technology like nuclear weapons.

EDIT: I learned a lot! I had always assumed that we has enough nukes stockpiled to kill every last human many times over. As many have pointed out it would be nearly impossible to actually do so using current stockpiles. Much less all other life."
