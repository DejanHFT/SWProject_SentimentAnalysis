"Long night layover at Denver airport, what can I explore ?",DefinitionOfTakingL,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/19blml2/long_night_layover_at_denver_airport_what_can_i/,28,0,"I am taking a flight from California to east coast next month and will have an 8 hour layover in Denver airport. In my journey to visit all 50 states, I have been to 28 and would like to step out in Denver and spend some time to tick off CO. Any ideas what can I do from 10 pm to 6 am ? Like 24 hour eateries etc ? Thanks."
