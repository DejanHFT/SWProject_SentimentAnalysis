How do I motivate my roommate to start getting fit?,Dothatshizz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5cpe9j/how_do_i_motivate_my_roommate_to_start_getting_fit/,64,52,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask, but I though it would be a good start. So my roommate has been through quite a bit recently. Her first boyfriend of two years broke up with her, she found out she had a miscarriage 3 months after they broke up. Fast forward 8 months later and lots of spiralling down and weight gain. She hates herself, keeps eating badly, hasn't dated, and extremely self conscious. I want to help her out cause I know how much of an amazing person she can be. I just don't know how to get her butt into gear. I know it's her choice to make, and she has been trying, but not enough to get her anywhere. I want to push her to achieve her goals, but I'm not sure how to go about that. I have been changing introducing a healthier diet by cooking meals for us, cause I am the one that cooks the most at home (don't get me wrong, love cooking!) but I know that's not enough. What's something I can do to get her started in being fit and eating healthy? Should I be blunt with her and tell her to get her ass into gear? I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I know she is giving me lots of excuses. Help please!

TL;DR: want to help roommate lose wait and feel more confident. Don't know where to start, don't want to hurt her feelings "
