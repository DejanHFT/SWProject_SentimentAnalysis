What do you think is the most historically important event(s) for an American citizen to know?,collid-o-scope,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/67g9qp/what_do_you_think_is_the_most_historically/,1842,5705,"Let me elaborate. I need your help 'saving' my marriage. My husband knows startlingly little about history. (And geography and biology and ... well, you get the idea.)

""Who won the American civil war?""
                     The..... South?

""Who were the Axis powers in World War II?""
                     Germany... And China.

""Find India on this map.""
                      I can't.

""What does the First Amendment guarantee the right to?"" 
                      No idea, but the second amendment is guns! 

He has no idea what the Dust Bowl was. Completely in the dark about the Great Depression. He wasn't even sure what the Civil Rights movement was. 

He graduated public school in Louisiana with a 4.0 GPA. But that's beyond the point.

I believe being a good citizen and well rounded individual means having at least a basic understanding of history. (Especially the history of the country you reside in.) So, I have decided to try to get him up to speed with history. (He's on board, too, I'm not just pushing history down his throat. :P)

So my question is: What are the most important historical events that every voting, tax paying adult should know? (In American history or worldwide.) 

Bonus: Any good books that deals with the aforementioned historical event(s) in engaging and accurate ways. 

Bonus Bonus: Any good history teaching tips.
