how would i go about making a big tree for my classroom?,Kindly-Small-4845,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15fnlxt,3,3,i’m doing a jungle theme in my kindergarten class this year and want to make a big tree. i’m not sure what to look for so i could DIY it. I tried looking up big construction paper or bulletin board paper rolls but i’m having a hard time. any ideas how I could achieve something like the images in a cost efficient way?
