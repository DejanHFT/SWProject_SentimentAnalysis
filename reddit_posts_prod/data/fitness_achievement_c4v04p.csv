How to achieve small waist to large glute ratio?,grandpa_milk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/c4v04p/how_to_achieve_small_waist_to_large_glute_ratio/,14,12,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

So I'm 28/M currently on a PPL for aesthetics. One of my main goals is to have more defined glutes -- namely a sort of ""notch"" where the lower-back/waist meets the upper glutes. Example of what I'm talking about [here](https://i.imgur.com/rO06ddM.jpg) (mildly NFSW).

&#x200B;

Right now I have fat in my love-handle area, so you can't really see the ""notch"". [Photos here](https://imgur.com/a/YyUhJO8) (slightly NSFW, in my underwear). It looks more like my glutes just kinda blend into my love handles. My torso looks more like an hourglass than an upside down triangle. Lower glutes are fairly defined though.

&#x200B;

Is it merely a matter of bulking the glutes and then cutting to a low body fat percentage? Or are there other muscles at play that will help accentuate this? I also have wider hips for a man -- does this have an effect on anything?

Thank you!"
