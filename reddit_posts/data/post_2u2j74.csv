"Does ""I don't know/maybe"" exist in AI logic?",melbournematt,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2u2j74/does_i_dont_knowmaybe_exist_in_ai_logic/,4,4,"I was wondering if programming AI in ultimately True/False binary outcomes is what's preventing AI from excelling?

Is there any AI work that includes a ""maybe"" option. Could programs learn to ask for the bits of information they need to give a Yes/No answer?"
