"If all technology disappeared and all that remained were humans and their knowledge (including books), how long would it take to build back up to our current technology?",speakeasy42,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/eur3n/if_all_technology_disappeared_and_all_that/,50,63,"I'm really just hoping to stir some discussion on what things are necessary to build other things, and the time it would take going from wood and stone tools back to we are without having to relearn everything.


edit: to clarify, I am talking more or less about the technological requirements that must be in place successively to build things. For example, microprocessors require very precise manufacturing capability and the machines that build them too require some sort of technology, and so on and so forth. 


I guess I should have phrased my question differently as I'm not really interested in the social requirements to rebuild, but the technological walls that have to be climbed to go from rocks, to hammers, to metal forging, to chemical processing, to fabrication, etc, etc. I suppose it's a really open ended question but I guess I was hoping for more talk on what would be required to be done first before we could have tvs, microchips, etc etc."
