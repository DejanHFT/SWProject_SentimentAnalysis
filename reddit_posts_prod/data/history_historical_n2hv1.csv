"We list strange, obscure and bizarre historical events from the 20th Century",MONDARIZ,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/n2hv1/we_list_strange_obscure_and_bizarre_historical/,281,185,"I love history and have chewed my way through most of the 20th century. However, my main love is the little known events and happenings that rarely make it into history books. Wikipedia is a great source for these historical bits, but I was hoping Reddit could list a few that I have overlooked.

Example:

During Second World War the British Royal Navy worked on attacking Germany by releasing free flying helium balloons: [Operation Outward](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Outward). Despite releasing more than 100.000 balloons the only confirmed German ‘casualty’ was a generator in the Leipzig power plant (knocked out by a short circuit). In fact more damage was caused in neutral Sweden, when unexpected winds carried a number of War Balloons the wrong way. Sweden filed an official diplomatic complaint. 

Please note that the bits need not be related to war – it could be anything.
