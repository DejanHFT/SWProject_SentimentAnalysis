"Is there artificial intelligence that can ""learn""?",starrydome,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3hppf4/is_there_artificial_intelligence_that_can_learn/,8,2,"Do we have AI that can ""learn"", or is it just responding to new environments with programming we already gave it?  For example, take self-driving cars. Let's say the car registers some kind of problem/damage when it went over a speed bump too fast, could it go back and rewrite or add to its programming to go slower the next time it encountered a speed bump?  Or would a human have to fix the programming?  "
