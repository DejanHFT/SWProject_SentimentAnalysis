"Ideas for shelving ,ideas are appreciated",Ok_Organization9369,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18704a1,1,0,"Hey guys hope you can help. My wife’s closet has this L-shaped shelf above her hangers. As you can see, it’s hard to organize things like this. I know I can do shelves, but I hate how that back corner is hard to access and inconvenient to get to. What I’d love to do is have half drawers on a track that rotates out. (Imagine two rows of the puzzle in the second picture). 

I have no idea how to make tracks that run that way, but feel like it’s possibleto achieve. If anyone has suggestions or could point me in the proper direction, it would be much appreciated. 

Of course, I'd love to execute this idea, but i'm not dead set on it. As long as the back corner doesn't become a forgotten wasteland, im open to any other ideas. 

thank you"
