Warcraft: Critiquing the Critics,kyu2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4lxeey/warcraft_critiquing_the_critics/,118,16,"Last week saw a lot of ups and downs for fans of the Warcraft universe that were looking forward to the impending release of the movie. Some terribly negative reviews, followed by more moderate reviews and even some highly positive ones. The film opened very well in a few European markets, but there's still been a lot of back and forth on this sub-reddit regarding reception of the movie. The naysayers have repeatedly pointed to [RottenTomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/warcraft/) as an indicator of the quality of the film. So, I wanted to take a bit to look over some of the negative reviews, namely the 3 of 4 ""top critics"" on RottenTomatoes that gave it a rotten score.

**The Reviews: Summarized**    
I tried to highlight all the critiques in these reviews, as well as points I found interesting or important, but feel free to read them yourself.

[Tom Huddleston - Time Out](http://www.timeout.com/london/film/warcraft)    
- Bias against World of Warcraft(incorrectly cites it as source)    
- Says acting is bad and characters are dumb    
- Draws comparison with Lord of the Rings(comparing Anduin Lothar with Aragorn)    
- Snide remark about CGI    
- ""Fantastical, perhaps, but far from fantastic""

[Geoff Berkshire - Variety](http://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/warcraft-film-review-world-of-warcraft-movie-1201780459/)    
- Bias against video game adaptions    
- Says movie steals from LotR, Game of Thrones, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and Avatar    
- Father/Son relationships exploited for melodrama    
- Characters too emo    
- Garona looks and sounds silly    
- Movie and characters should be more silly/fun    
- Says CGI and aesthetic is a swing and a miss    
- likens it to ""those animated ads for iPhone apps""

[Alonso Duralde - The Wrap](http://www.thewrap.com/warcraft-review-swords-sorcery-and-stupidity-abound-in-game-adaptation/)    
- redefines ""Soulless Corporate Filmmaking""    
- Incorrectly cites WoW as source    
- Likens it to Battlefield Earth    
- Too many characters, locations, motivations and subplots    
- Bad CGI including overuse of green screens(most sets were not green screen) and not-very-expressive orcs    
- Mages are Jedi!    
- Lots of action but boring    
- Cinematogropher presented ""artificial"" aesthetic(don't think that's the cinematographer's fault)    
- Score generically percussive    
- Bad acting    
- Super Mario Bros. movie was better

**What They Agree On**    
- This film shouldn't have been made - They all open their reviews with pretty clear bias against the film, albeit for different reasons.    
- They all comment on CGI - Admittedly, Tom Huddleston doesn't outright say the CGI is bad, but more implies that the amount used is off-putting. The other two do say the CGI is bad, which flies in the face of what most other reviews are saying, even some of the negative ones.    
- 2 of them say the acting is bad - Though they don't agree on which actors are the worst.    
- 2 of them say the characters are dumb

**Final Thoughts**    
Overall, I don't feel like there's a whole lot you can take from these reviews other than that the reviewers didn't like the movie, which isn't the job of a critic.  The only critique they agree on that I find informative is the bad acting and bad CGI, but the obvious bias they show at the start of their reviews discredits those critiques, at least in my eyes. And the CGI has been pretty widely praised so far, which further speaks to their lack of credibility.

Anyway, the baby's up, so I have to go...what do you guys think?"
