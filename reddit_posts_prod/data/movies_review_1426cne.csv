**Reviews**

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-review-1235506416/):

>These Hasbro action figures, and their onscreen incarnations, are capable of reducing even the most mature, jaded adult into an awestruck child who just wants to get down on the floor and play with them.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-review-1235632703/):

>It’s got a relatable human story that works, and thanks to a script that actually has sustained bursts of dialogue, the robots felt more real to me as characters than they usually do.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2023/06/transformers-rise-of-the-beast-review-exciting-action-sequences-and-generi-1235409327/):

>Rise of the Beast is another generic story about an intergalactic menace from the sky carries all the plot predictability of a broken clock.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-review-1234871253/) (D):

>It’s as if some executive saw Mattel and Greta Gerwig turning “Barbie” into genuine art, so they made a George Costanza-style decision to veer in the opposite direction purely out of spite.

[Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/05/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-review-sequel) (1/5):

>Everything has a vague partial finish, as if director Steve Caple Jr and the five-person brain trust responsible for the script banked on the audience’s familiarity with the shape of a movie to fill in the gaps they’ve left.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-review/):

>Where Bay’s movies where incoherent messes that necessitated heaps of migraine meds, Caple Jr. actually manages to pull off something articulate and rousing with “Rise of the Beasts,” thanks in large part to the ever-relatable presences of Fishback and Ramos, and a parting note that’s just witty enough in its suggestion of a bigger universe.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-review) (7/10):

>Transformers: Rise of the Beasts proves that the Transformers franchise is accelerating in the right direction, delivering solid Autobots action and a solid voice cast behind the infamous robots in disguise.

[Slash Film](https://www.slashfilm.com/1305351/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-review/) (5/10):

>There are bursts of inspiration here and there, such as when the plot shifts to Peru and suddenly takes on an ""Indiana Jones"" flavor (which, annoyingly, the characters can't help but comment upon) or when an early horror-tinged sequence puts a new spin on the famous ""Raptors in the kitchen"" scene from ""Jurassic Park."" But such joys don't arrive consistently enough to make this venture worthwhile.

[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-review/) (2.5/5):

>It's a serviceable blockbuster, but familiarity in nearly every aspect muddles an obvious attempt to revive a franchise that might be better dormant. 

[io9](https://gizmodo.com/transformers-rise-of-beasts-review-hasbro-optimus-prime-1850479893):

>Coming back to the world of robots in disguise, the bar is basically “Please don’t suck.” And we’re happy to report Transformers: Rise of the Beasts does not suck. It’s actually quite entertaining, especially for a Transformers movie.

[The Film Verdict](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-review-1235506416/):

>Gives you some people to care about, sprinkled among the clanging heavy machinery that remains the real star of the series.

[Blu-ray.com](https://www.blu-ray.com/Transformers-Rise-of-the-Beasts/1445570/#Review) (8/10):

>Returns “Transformers” to bigness with a fresh set of players, creating a successful sequel and quite an entertaining viewing experience.

[UPROXX](https://uproxx.com/movies/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-review/):

>It’s kind of remarkable what can be done with a Transformers movie with a director who actually likes these characters. (And also very much loves his mid-90s needle-drop jams.)

[Movie Nation](https://rogersmovienation.com/2023/06/06/movie-review-transformers-rise-of-the-beasts/) (1.5/4):

>But the half-hearted attempts to build a hero’s quest story about these increasingly collectible toys and ongoing campaign to wash the humanity right out of the franchise is something all the shiny, tactile and identifiable Freightliner, Porsche or Ducati parts in humanoid robotic form cannot hide.

[Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-review-theres-more-here-than-meets-the-eye/) (3.5/4):

>No Michael Bay. No Mark Wahlberg. No oppressive bombast.

[The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-review-did-robots-make-this-rusty-garbage-wznvst6wc) (1/5):

>On the positive side, at just over two hours it’s one of the shortest in the Transformers franchise, and so unfolds like a brutalising yet mercifully limited attack on the occipital lobe.

[Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/transformers-rise-of-beasts-movie-review-47f943b2530f272b8081205d618f4d74) (1/4):

>Look, maybe we should be anxious. ChatGPT clearly could have a written a better movie.
