A quote of inspiration,Mistrdogfish_,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18x4vhr/a_quote_of_inspiration/,2,3,"I have been writing for a bit now, majority of it is for my personal use. In the past few months however, I have really been diving deep into it, getting more serious about my works. For Christmas one of my roommates bought me Stephen King’s ‘On Writing’ which I have been going through. He says a quote pretty early on in the book that goes, “Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open.” That really stood out to me, and I hope it sticks with you too. The simple saying has made me rethink all my processes of writing, and how I truly want to execute my works. In a way, rekindled the passion once again, I just wanted to share that before I started diving head first into my own stuff once again. 

Have a great day!"
