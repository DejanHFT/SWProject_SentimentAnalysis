Is Under Armours new rush technology legit or a snake oil?,NeogeneRiot,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/c381m4/is_under_armours_new_rush_technology_legit_or_a/,42,87,"Under Armour is claiming that they infused fabric with minerals and that ""Your body emits energy, Mineral infused fabric absorbs energy, Energy is reflected back into your tissue and you gain strength and endurance"" This claim seems like major BS. They said it uses Infrared Technology and that it is scientifically tested and athlete proven. I cant find any claims to back it up at all."
