How to develop your creativity/creative thinking?,Icy_Ad6604,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/oh231c/how_to_develop_your_creativitycreative_thinking/,4,1,"Im a designer. In western societies many professions are highly specialized, even in design. Even though in design being also a generalist is a strenght. You can specialize on certain fields, design products or certain part of process. But on top of that, what is the thing designers are paid to do? On top of knowledge that is embedded in designing and the knowledge it produces, creativity/creative thinking or abductive thinking is intrinsic to design - and that is in my opinion, the greatest strenght designer can have. 


So how can I develop it?"
