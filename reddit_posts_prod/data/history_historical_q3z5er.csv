Why is Jan Žižka the “One-Eyed General” so under-appreciated in modern historical texts and videos?,OurLoyalSunBoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/q3z5er/why_is_jan_žižka_the_oneeyed_general_so/,262,1487,"Jan Žižka was the military leader of the Hussites in the 15th century (specifically the Táborité Hussites and later the Sirotci Hussites,) and used innovative tactics to hold off three crusades. After that his tactics were used to hold off two more even after his death. For most of this he was without one of his eyes and towards the last moments of his life he was completely blind. He had never lost a battle, and his most famous victory had him outnumbered seven to one. I would easily consider him one of the best generals in history. So why is he never mentioned anywhere? We learned about him in our Czech education system, however, he isn’t mentioned anywhere else, and it’s hard to find any dedicated information about him unless you specifically search for it or already know his name. He is completely overlooked by most mayor historical channels, kept out of books from the era and generally just forgotten or unmentioned. Why? If anyone here has some thoughts or something to share, please do, I find it an interesting subject. Thank you."
