What are some cheap delicious meals?,sunlitstranger,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/p4gh92/what_are_some_cheap_delicious_meals/,69,24,"When I grocery shop I’m doing it to be cost effective versus takeout, but I always end up making the same two things. Rice, beans, chicken, and a veggie / or spaghetti with sausage, or ground beef with onions and peppers. Want to make something tonight but I’m not savvy like that to think of something new. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated, and clearly I’m not a 5 star chef so go easy on me haha

Edit: Did not expect so many answers. Gonna be busy and well fed these next few weeks. Even if I don’t comment back I’m reading all of them, and will visit back here to keep trying these suggestions. Thanks everyone"
