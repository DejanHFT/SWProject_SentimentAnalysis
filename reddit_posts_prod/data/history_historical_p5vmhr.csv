Are cornrows in C-dramas a historical accuracy or a creative choice?,SimishlySimkins,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/p5vmhr/are_cornrows_in_cdramas_a_historical_accuracy_or/,58,257,"I’m a huge fan of historical C-Dramas with little to no fantasy but I’ve noticed a trend of characters who are supposed to be evil or tough always have their wigs styled in what looks like cornrows as opposed to the rest of the casts whose wigs are much different. *See Tuoba Yu (Prince of Nanan/the antagonist) in Princess Li Weiyoung as well as Lhawang Dorji (the Mongolian prince) in Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures.* I find the intersection of cultures really interesting, such as the similarities between the braids of Tibetan women and Maasai men but with all the digging I’ve done on this topic in particular, I can’t find any real life photographs or art work of anyone from ancient China having hair braided onto their head in this specific style. The closest results I get are Tibetan women’s braids and that is visibly not the same. I don’t want to assume the worst and believe that the costume departments for these shows have a negative connotation of cornrows due to how western media depicts Black Americans therefore equates stereotypes like physical strength and/or danger to the hairstyle, because the hair might just be a cultural intersection that is unrelated to my culture could have historical relevance to them. Does anyone references of people in ancient China wearing a hairstyle that looks like cornrows?"
