Where do people find their inspiration for fantasy world and languages,_takeitupanotch,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/14nn4lq/where_do_people_find_their_inspiration_for/,6,1,"As hard as I try I just canâ€™t seem to get creative enough to make up names for fantasy worlds and languages. I have no problem writing scenes and coming up with dialogue and plots but the details like the names of worlds and languages stumps me. Right now, I am currently trying to come up with a rhyming spell to take a character from one realm to another and I have writers block about it so just wondering if anyone can share their inspirations or tools for writing this type of fantasy content."
