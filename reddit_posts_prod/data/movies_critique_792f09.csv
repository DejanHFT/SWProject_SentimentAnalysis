War for the planet of the apes critique (Spoilers),kingslayers0,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/792f09/war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes_critique_spoilers/,2,0,"I watched this movie last night and I was enjoying it but there were a few things I disliked so much about this movie, I would like to know if I'm not alone in this:
1. The humans were in their base getting ready to battle the other humans, why is their base a bomb? Why are they fighting basically next to a gas tank that's going to blow up their whole base? Writing like this ruins the movie for me, why couldn't they (people responsible for the script) thought of a better way less stupid than that?
2. The way the monkeys got the key from the guard. They basically threw crap at him and the guard acted in the stupidest way possible, again, why wasn't this caught in the process of making the movie to come out with a better way to get the key in a less lazy way?
3. When the humans are fighting each other at the end they get buried by snow. Were the writers of the script and director or whomever just gave up on this movie? People told me this was a good movie but all I saw was pure laziness and/or stupidity, you come out with a lazy way to just end the movie and people are supposed to be happy with it?"
