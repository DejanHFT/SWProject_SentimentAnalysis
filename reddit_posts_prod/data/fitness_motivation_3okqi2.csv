How do you get motivated to exercise at the end of a long day?,Hales666,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3okqi2/how_do_you_get_motivated_to_exercise_at_the_end/,219,113,"Hi r/fitness. I'm F(25) and am finding it really hard to stay motivated and make myself exercise at the end of a busy work day. I have no other time to go to the gym or workout at home apart from when I get home. By then I'm tired and hungry and just want to sit on the couch and eat my dinner. Not to mention I walk 3km to work and 3km back every day. I have recently lost 18lbs and don't want to give up now! Ideally I would like to loose another 18! Can anyone give me any useful tips of getting motivated at the end of the day?


Edit: WOW thank you all so much for the great advice I cant tell you how helpful it has been. I definitely think I am ready to change my mindset about going. So nice to have written a post which has generated so many positive comments instead of some of the gym snobs you can get slagging you off for your question on here. Also for what its worth just back from the gym and feeling great thank you all so much! "
