AMA!",ghostcondensate,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/d6vb8q/im_sam_copeland_a_bestselling_published_writer/,77,184,"Hi there! My name is Sam Copeland and I'm an author and literary agent. My debut children's book was published by Penguin Random House in February and the sequel came out last month, and it's become the bestselling middle grade debut of the year! I'm also an agent for lots of top writers at one of the best literary agencies in London. Ask me all about my journey (I even submitted anonymously to other agents!), how to get published - whatever!
