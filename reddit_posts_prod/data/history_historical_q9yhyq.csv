Can anyone explain in a dispassionate historical manner why the Baptist denomination ended up becoming the largest Protestant denomination in the USA?,luxtabula,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/q9yhyq/can_anyone_explain_in_a_dispassionate_historical/,343,1544,"I found [this wonderful post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8yd9qj/the_american_south_is_mostly_baptist_yet_many_of/) that explains why the Church of England/Episcopal Church collapsed and became the dominant religion of wealthier and well-connected WASP establishments in the USA. But is there a similar explanation for why the Baptist denomination became the largest protestant denomination? There were several other denominations to pick from at the time (Methodist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, Reformed, etc...) so I'd like to know what made Baptist gain an edge.

EDIT: There seems to be a common theme - Lower bar to entry for founding a church compared to the other denominations.

>The argument was that much less was required of a person to become a Baptist preacher than many other denominations, allowing quicker growth.

>Baptists also don't require a degree from a seminary (often 2 to 3 years) to lead a church, so it's much easier to become a pastor. With a larger pool of potential pastors, you can start a lot more churches more quickly.

>Baptist churches are pretty uniquely fitted to America. Americans tend to prefer a high level of independence, grassroots democratic organization, and a lot of mobility. Baptist churches are congregational--individual churches vote in their elders and pastors, and even their doctrinal statements. They are also easy to found. You pretty much just have to rent out a building and tell people you're starting a church and voila! new Baptist church in town. Plus, their strong emphasis on evangelization and relatively simple message are easy to spread and adopt.
