"Trying to lose weight, going to be eating a lot of chicken breast; how do I keep it delicious?",drew_tattoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/58izbe/trying_to_lose_weight_going_to_be_eating_a_lot_of/,320,464,"Hey /r/cooking! The title explains it all; I'm about to be on a diet of mainly chicken breast, veggies and rice. Thing is I'm not the biggest chicken fan because I kinda suck at cooking it, especially breasts. The only chicken recipe that comes out well for me every time is [A Chicken and 40 Cloves](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/40-cloves-and-a-chicken-recipe.html), which is good and all but I do want to mix it up. 

Mainly I want to know how to keep my chicken from drying out when I cook it? I've heard brining can be a good option for that. Also I'd love some recipes that don't add on too many calories if possible. So ya, any advice and guidance would be wonderful! Thanks in advance.

Edit: Another question would be which is the ""safer"" way to cook chicken? Roast or pan fry?

EditEdit: I guess I could have phrased things differently. I'm not going to exclusively eat just chicken breast, I'm more concerned with a caloric goal and I've heard breast is a good way to feel full and eat less calories. I'll also be eating fish and pork tenderloin(which I'd forgotten about until I made this post). I appreciate all of the weight loss advice but I'm mostly concerned with how to make tasty chicken at the moment."
