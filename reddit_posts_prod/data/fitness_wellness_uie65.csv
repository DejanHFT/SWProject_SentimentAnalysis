Squat advice for well-worn knees?,dcolt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/uie65/squat_advice_for_wellworn_knees/,31,12,"M, 55

Around the beginning of the year I decided I wanted to see what being strong was like before I got too old and started doing SL Mo./Wed./Fri.

I've been progressing reasonably well, except that recently, as I approach 220lbs, my knees (particularly the right one) have been sending messages. I've deloaded to work more on form a couple of times to make sure I'm getting below parallel, getting the bar positioned lower on my back, etc., and the problem persists. They seem to recover pretty well Fri-Mo, but 5x5 three times Mo.-Fri. seems to be more than they're comfortable with.

I should add that my right meniscus is pretty much shredded (I have the tomograph films somewhere).

So given that I need to take it easier on squats, is it better to reduce the number of sets, or skip squats entirely one day?

(And if it's the latter, I'm open to suggestions for other exercises I can do in the time freed up.)

Thanks!"
