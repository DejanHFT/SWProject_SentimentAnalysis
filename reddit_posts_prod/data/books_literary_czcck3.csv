Does anyone feel like the term “literary fiction“ is pretentious?,Carstairs_01,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/czcck3/does_anyone_feel_like_the_term_literary_fiction/,112,0,"  Recently, I’ve met a lot of people who refuse to read any fiction that isn’t “literary fiction” and it’s been getting on my nerves.  These are also the people that believe fantasy and science fiction have no literary value.  Forgive me for going on a tangent, but in my opinion, the only concrete difference between other works of fiction and fantasy/sci-fi is that fantasy and science fiction novels take place in worlds that work differently than our own, and I find that to be a beautiful thing to explore, not something to be dismissed and scoffed at.  
  
  Different books will mean different things to certain people and I feel it’s unfair to arbitrarily label a book as being more meaningful than its peers.  Good or bad, all written fiction is literature, and your choice of reading should be based on whether or not a book interests you, not some label that makes you feel superior for reading it."
