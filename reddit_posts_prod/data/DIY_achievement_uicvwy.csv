I would like them to be horizontally straight and have an equal amount of space in between them (consider them all as full circles when thinking of equal space between them).

This is the result I would somewhat like to achieve:

PS: I am a DIY noob. I tried drawing a straight horizontal line on the wall with a non-digital levelling tool (the one with the air bubble) and it ended up being not straight at all, even though the air bubble was pretty much in the middle.

Thanks in advance."
