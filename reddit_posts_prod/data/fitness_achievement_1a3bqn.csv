"QUESTIONS --- Alternatives for running Cardio, while achieving the Same Results.",J_U_D_G_E,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1a3bqn/questions_alternatives_for_running_cardio_while/,21,3,"Hello everyone

In my experience, there is nothing like running Cardio for weight-loss, however, I wanted to quickly ask if you guys can suggest a comparable alternative to Cardio, with the same results as running cardio.

Eliptical seems to be the way to go for me?
Others have suggested the rowing machine, but my gym does not have one.

Any suggestions? Do you suggest I just stick to running and let the pain flow?"
