I think therefore I am?,hybridthm,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f89nq/i_think_therefore_i_am/,6,0,"So a while back some philosopher called Descarte was wondering if we existed or not, and came up with a simple yet pretty neat proof of his existence, 'I think therefore I am'. Basically since I can think, I must exist, or at least something must exist to which I can claim some sense of I. It's pretty hard to doubt this, but I did my best.
So i start with the statement, this statement is true. Now you can argue that the statement is true, since, well, if it's true it's true. But you should also be able to see that the statement can be false, since if it's false it's not true, therefore false. 
So this got me wondering, if this statement can be both true or false, or maybe either true or false, then can thinking in some way be linked to both existence and non-existence?
Imagine a computer program, which you program to say I think therefore I am, when asked to contemplate it's existence, similar to cleverbot. It will be adamant it exists, and in fairness it would probably be right. Which is fine.
But now you delete it, so it doesn't exist anymore. Can you say that it is no longer capable of coming to the conclusion I think therefore I am. Because let's be honest, none of us have seen the flip side where we don't exist (presuming we do) to justify that only things that exist can think. Which is what the whole assumption relies on"
