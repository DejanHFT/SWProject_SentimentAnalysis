Contemplation of Pain and Death,IEnjoyCornbread,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/pwz9w/contemplation_of_pain_and_death/,10,4,"I've hardly any experience with philosophy, so excuse me for what could be a lack of clarity and/or exquisiteness. 

I was watching a squirrel today, and as I approached he frantically ran away (all I want is a squirrel to hang with). I began thinking about what he was actually running from, or what any being actually runs from when they perceive danger. Was the squirrel running away from potential pain, potential death, or both. Can the two even be separated?

I began to question whether or not the two are synonymous. Our ability to feel pain is an evolutionary mechanism that helps keep us away from the painful stimuli. I then figured that, pain being a survival mechanism, its role was not only to keep us from avoiding pain but, on a larger scale, keeping us away from death. When we are in a state of pain, aren't we in a state that is closer to death (as a process) than we are in a state of non-pain? Pain, I think, serves the purpose of indicating the shortening of distance between existence and non-existence (these thoughts being completely independent of any idea of an afterlife).

If I accept that this is the role of pain, to avoid death and prolong life, than couldn't I also say that life is inherently valuable, and death is an obliteration of that value? (This begs the question, I suppose, of whether not good = bad. Does it? Or does not good simply = not good, or some neutral state). 

In my thoughts about death, I have found no luck whatsoever in transcending the Epicurean viewpoint that death cannot be an evil. But if we are driven to avoid pain, and thus driven to avoid death, I feel like it must mean that life is valuable in and of itself, and a loss of a value, death, is an evil.

Thanks for reading and I appreciate anything you guys have to say. I feel that death is the only inevitability in life, (disregarding any ideas of singularity) and so I find it quite worthwhile to think about!

TL;DR: Being in a state of pain is being in a state closer to death than if one was in a state of non-pain. We are inclined to avoid pain, and thus inclined to keep ourselves closer to life than death. Does this make life valuable, and make death, a stripper of that value, evil?
