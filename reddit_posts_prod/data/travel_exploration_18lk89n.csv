Suggestions on Exploring Christmas markets in Europe ?,silver_wingzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18lk89n/suggestions_on_exploring_christmas_markets_in/,0,0,"I am living in the UAE and have got a Schengen visa from Netherlands recently . I am planning to travel to Amsterdam in the coming weekend for a quick trip of 3 days . 
I was thinking of exploring Rijksmuseum and spend the evening exploring Christmas markets ( I have been to Amsterdam couple of times inthe past and have explored the place quite well ) . However I learned from some online platforms that Christmas markets in Germany are the best compared to Amsterdam or Belgium . That now made me think if I should get a train/bus to the nearest german cities like Cologne or Dusseldorf . 

What are your thoughts , which city would be better - Cologne or Dusseldorf ? Or should I stay back in Amsterdam?"
