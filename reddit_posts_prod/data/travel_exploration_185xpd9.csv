Do you have any travel rituals or habits that you swear by when exploring new places?,ChaseBrockheart,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/185xpd9/do_you_have_any_travel_rituals_or_habits_that_you/,216,337,"Anything that you do that helps you really enjoy a place better?

Example: For me, I like to go to a local supermarket - not a bazaar or fancy tourist market, but an actual supermarket where normal working folks do their daily shopping, and shop around and see what they buy. I usually buy some snacks and treats to keep in the hotel, and then when it's time to go home, I bring a big bunch of things like spice packets, etc so I can cook fun foods for a month or two after I get back.
