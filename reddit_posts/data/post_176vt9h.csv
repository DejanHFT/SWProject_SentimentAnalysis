Space research budget question,MicroBluElephant,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/176vt9h/space_research_budget_question/,33,0," Humanity is ready to spend trillions on space research and space exploration. This budget is spreaded across huge areas of interest. One conclusion that comes up from every new research is that us as humans were not designed for space travel. Adding the human factor to any mission will increase its price about 10-100 times. So what is the point in investing so much in inter solar system research (except for finding signs of life)? For example, I do believe we will get to mars but what's the point? Does developing the capability to sustain life on Mars worth its budget? From a scientific perspective only (disregarding economy, military and greed needs) Why not focus most of the budget on breaking our solar system boundaries. For example signals of life on other planets or something like the Starshot Breakthrough Initiative that really can make a difference. What do you think? "
