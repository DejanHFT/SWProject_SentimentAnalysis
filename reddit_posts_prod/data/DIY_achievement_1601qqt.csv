Garden Sheds / Outdoor Rooms,bobsmithirl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1601qqt/garden_sheds_outdoor_rooms/,8,3,"Hi all, I’m a complete noob when it comes to D.I.Y living in Ireland.

A dream of mine is to construct an outdoor room in my garden where music production / rehearsal will be the main purpose. (Timber frame).

My question is how achievable would this be for someone with little experience? I had thought about maybe trying my hand at a small garden shed first.

Would you guys have any opinions / resources that may be helpful? I don’t intend on constructing the base myself. I will most likely hire someone to lay the foundation / landscape the area first."
