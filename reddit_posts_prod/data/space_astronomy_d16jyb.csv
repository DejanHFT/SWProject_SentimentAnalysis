Astronomy Club,haroutpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/d16jyb/astronomy_club/,4,9,"Hello. So I am thinking about creating an astronomy club for my school cause I think it interests a lot of people. The problem is, I do not know any real good activities for the club. If some of you could recommend activities it would be appreciated. I would prefer daytime activities over than  nighttime, but anything helps. Thanks!"
