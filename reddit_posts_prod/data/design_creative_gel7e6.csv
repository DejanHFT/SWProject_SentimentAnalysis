What happened to THEN Creative?,Keon20p4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/gel7e6/what_happened_to_then_creative/,0,4,"While searching for a new USB Stick I came across this cool blog and began a new journey to find the creators of it. But no matter where I searched, with or without hyper-specific terms, I was unable to find any other information besides old and obviously outdated social media. Additionally, what seemed to be their old website was now a weird chinese porn site. If anyone has any information regarding this design-firm, I would really appreciate that. thx :)
