Here's my attempt at motivation.,Blake6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/dqugz/heres_my_attempt_at_motivation/,35,48,"Last year I was in high school (senior year). It was my second year of taking weights in high school, and I was loving it. When I went in the first day I was surprised to see that this kid named Tony was in there. Tony had a mental disorder, I don't know which one, but he was mentally retarded. I thought it was a bad idea to have someone like that in a weight room (a potentially dangerous place). However, Tony listened to directions very well and did what he was instructed to do. He payed attention when he was spotting, didn't jerk around, and had good form in every lift.
Not only that, he was a very likable guy. He high fived people often, and generally lightened the mood. When we did our one rep maxs, he would high five people even if they couldn't get the rep done. He pushed us all to do better, to work harder everyday, sometimes in ways he didn't quite comprehend. It was an inspiration to watch him lift every single day. While he helped us work hard, we also pushed him to work hard, specifically getting him to do dips and pull-ups, which he didn't like doing. In the end, he was there for the same reason everyone else was, to get stronger. I don't think I'll ever forget that guy. 
So next time you're slacking off, letting go, gaining weight, and generally being a lazy motherfucker, you think of my mentally handicapped friend Tony, who is as we speak in a high school weight room working his ass off to get stronger. There is no excuse to not working hard, even if you're retarded."
