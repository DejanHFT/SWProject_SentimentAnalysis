Chalk paint help,mrdonni,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/19byjvc,1,2,"Hi All,

I wanted to give my bedside table a new lease on life. I prepped by sanding with a 80grit followed by a 120. Coated with 2 layers of chalk paint, however the texture has come incredibly inconsistent. I tried rolling, brushing and still not happy. After applying I sanded back with a 600grit and that achieved the smooth finish I was after, at the cost of exposing some wood. 

Iâ€™m learning and after suggesting, thanks!"
