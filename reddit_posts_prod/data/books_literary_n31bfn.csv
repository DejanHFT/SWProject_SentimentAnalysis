What was your high school literary canon?,JustAManFromThePast,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/n31bfn/what_was_your_high_school_literary_canon/,64,26,"I've been trying to recall what was assigned and have been rereading them. So far I have:

Crime and Punishment

Hamlet

Julius Caesar

Macbeth

1984

All Quiet on the Western Front

The Great Gatsby

Huckleberry Finn

The Old Man and the Sea

The Grapes of Wrath

Pride and Prejudice

A Tale of Two Cities

Great Expectations

Sophocles’ Antigone

A Doll’s House

Siddharta Ghatama

Animal Farm

Watership Down

The Stranger

The Brothers Karamazov 

How do people feel about what was assigned?  Any favorites?  Any outliers?  I don't think many people were assigned Siddharta Ghatama, for example.  I'm also interested in the common canon, I'd be shocked if no one was assigned a single Shakespearean plays.  

Edit:

We also read poetry and went to plays, A Raisin' in the Sun, the Glass Menagerie, To Kill a Mockingbird, and a forgettable one woman show about Ginger Rogers, though we didn't read the plays beforehand.  Finally we had reading nights that were totally voluntary, and were hosted by all the teachers, not just the English department, so in addition to Death of A Salesman and Othello I read Black Swan and other pop-sci books.

Anyone else have outisde literature in highschool?  In European history we read parts of Candide and in Spanish class parts of Don Quixote."
