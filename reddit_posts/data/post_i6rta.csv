Is there anyone out there who has connections with a national news broadcast? We need your help,promarkman,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i6rta/is_there_anyone_out_there_who_has_connections/,1034,1464,"This is a post made to r/bicycling that I don't think is getting enough attention. Here is the post...

Last month, a dear friend of mine named Jan Morgan was hit while riding her bicycle training for an Ironman.  It was a straight road (no turns or hills) and the sun could not have been in the driver's eyes.  The car hit them from behind at full speed.  At first glance you might think this was an accident.  BUT Robbie Norton, the woman who hit Jan, got out of the car, looked at Jan, yelled at her for cycling in the road, got back in her car and ran Jan over again.  There were multiple witnesses who stopped Robbie Norton by dragging her out of the car.

Below is the verbatim crash report given to her husband David Morgan:

*THE CYCLIST WAS WEST BOUND ON MS50 NEAR THE TRULOVE LOOP INTERSECTION.  V1 WAS WEST BOUND ON MS50 APPROACHING THE CYCLIST FROM THE REAR.  THE FRONT OF V1 COLLIDED WITH THE REAR OF THE BICYCLE.  THE IMPACT THREW THE CYCLIST INTO THE AIR BEFORE LANDING ON THE HOOD OF V1 AND ONTO THE WINDSHIELD.  V1 CONTINUED FOR A FEW FEET BEFORE COMING TO A STOP.  THE CYCLIST WAS THEN THROWN TO THE ASPHALT WHEN V1 STOPPED.  THE DRIVER OF V1 EXITED THE VEHICLE AND OBSERVED THE CYCLIST WHILE TALKING ON THE PHONE.  D1 THEN REENTERED HER VEHICLE AND RAN THE CYCLIST OVER AGAIN BEFORE BEING FORCED FROM HER VEHICLE BY WITNESSES.  V1 CAME TO FINAL REST FACING WEST IN THE WEST BOUND LANE ON MS 50 JUST METERS WEST OF THE TRULOVE LOOP INTERSECTION.  THE CYCLIST CAME TO FINAL REST NEAR THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE OF V1.*

***BLOG DEDICATED TO JAN***

Reddit, the problem is, we've just learned they do not intend on pressing charges.  Reason?  The District Attorney, Forrest Allgood, says there are no laws in Mississippi to protect cyclists from this.

Her husband David Morgan and son Sean Dyess would like national attention in an effort to call for cycling safety advocacy.  

If you have any national media contacts please contact David or Sean. **Please PM me for more info on how to do this. I have removed all personal information from this post so as to prevent ones identity from being stolen directly from this post.**

As promised, here are some pictures.

Reddit, the only thing Jan's husband David and son Sean are asking for is some national media attention.  If you can help them get it, please do.  They want to keep this from happening to someone else.

I have David and Sean's phone number.  If you would prefer to contact them by phone, e-mail me at: pleasehelpdavid@yahoo.com and I will give you their cell phone numbers.

PLEASE HELP THEM!

**Edit** *I am not a family member or related. This is a post that originated on r/bicycling that I am trying to get more attention. I do not have all the answers where as I am still getting background on this story from the OP. I am trying to answer your questions as accurately and quickly as possible. I am staying up as late as possible to get this as much attention as possible. I want this to make it*

**Edit 2** **Please read this report before going into the comments** This is a report as to Mr. Allgood's official [statement](http://sports.groups.yahoo.com/group/JacksonMetroCyclists/message/7751)

**Edit 3** Thank you reddit for all the attention that this story is getting. I hope that there is still plenty more to come from those of you who read this as to what can be done towards advancing this story. I can't say enough as to how much help reddit has been. I am going to bed however and will be waking up early so that I can answer some more questions before work.

**Edit 4** Good morning reddit. I have read all of your comments and I would really like to let everyone know that this **IS NOT** for my own agenda. I want there to be justice for this person. I have not lied to you. If you read Mr. Allgoods response in **Edit 2** you will realize that there really is no law stopping someone from hitting a cyclist as long as ""*They do it under the speed limit and don't try to run away*"" That is not right and that is the point of this post. There needs to be justice here.

**Edit 5** To all those that still will read this post, Jan is now able to speak. It has taken her a month to get to this point. I have forwarded all contact information to the Morgan's in hopes that Jan's story will be on the news. Thank you to everyone for all the help."
