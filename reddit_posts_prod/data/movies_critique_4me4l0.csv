Come critique my film collection and personal ratings.,alohasprinting,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4me4l0/come_critique_my_film_collection_and_personal/,2,0,"I am organizing all the films I have bought over the years. I am attempting to rate all of them as well, so I just wanted to share my personal collection and opinions with r/movies to get some laughs, criticisms and more. The films with no ratings I have not yet watched, although I own, or I haven't seen in a long time. 

This is a link to the current Google Doc I've been organizing it all in. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18dywgkH3OgplCWmYdDazMi9iR8D3baUpTlIW4E9QZ4E/edit?usp=sharing

Let's discuss!"
