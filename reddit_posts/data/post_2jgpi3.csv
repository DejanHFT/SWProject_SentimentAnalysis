"You can send one 16,000 Bit (2Kb) file back in time to any computer that existed in the years 1950-1955. What do you send?",Spawn_Beacon,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2jgpi3/you_can_send_one_16000_bit_2kb_file_back_in_time/,30,9,"A breakthrough in science and quantum wumbo jumbo has enabled the transmission of electronic/magnetic jiggly wigglies waves that will embed themselves onto any form of media hooked up to a computer. The maximum amount of power the time machine can use at once is enough to send a 2kb file to the year 1950, and the least amount of energy that can be used can send it to 1955. Any less energy used will not cause the time travel.

NOTE: the data would be sent back exactly as is. Compressed files such as .zips would likely not be able to be uncompressed (i think?)

image files may/may not be read and engineers may not be able to find a way to ""decode"" the ""strange data."""
