Help understanding the compatibilist view of free will,omgpop,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/29p246/help_understanding_the_compatibilist_view_of_free/,113,37,"Hi there.
The subject of free will comes up a lot in this sub, and if I’m not imagining things, it has especially done so recently. What I tend to see is on the one hand rather philosophically inept/naïve kids like myself taking up the position the free will is impossible, because of the supposed truth of determinism. On the other hand, I see a glut of (to be quite honest) conceited students of philosophy who are ever keen to point out just how inept and naïve this argument is, whilst – in my view – rarely ever attempting to provide positive arguments for the compatibilism or [less] libertarianism which they often support. 

Considering how common this debate is, I thought it might be useful to have an open discussion where I invite some positive arguments for free will in the case where determinism is true. In order to focus the discussion, I will try to explicate my own naïve arguments as to why I think compatibilism/free will is either incoherent or incapable of doing any kind of work. In any replies, I would implore the restraint of condescension; people like myself who don’t have degrees in philosophy aren’t stupid, and we are capable of following explicit chains of reasoning.

Here goes one of my arguments, specifically aimed at compatibilism:

(1) Free will refers to an ability of people to select from a range of options vis-à-vis their actions or thoughts without constraint. 

- An implication, perhaps not endorsed by many compatibilists (but certainly by many who entertain the notion of free will), is that this also involves the ability ‘to have acted otherwise’ given a past action. So, say I stole a loaf of bread; on free-will, I could equally *not* have stolen the bread. This kind of capacity is often tied to moral questions (at least in the mind of a layman – see ‘ought implies can’).

(2) Determinism implies (i) that there is no such thing as the ability to act without constraint and (ii) there is no ability to ‘have acted otherwise’ given a choice. 

(3) Determinism is true.

(4) Ergo, compatibilism is incoherent.

Here is how I imagine a compatibilist could reply (and here is where I would hope most for some education):

-	What is meant by free will is not the ability to ‘act without constraint’ or ‘to have acted otherwise’, but simply to be able to choose from a range of options with no other compelling force than one’s own rational emotional contemplation. This knocks down premise (1) of my argument, so the conclusion fails. 

My response:

-	To define free will in this way – to tie it simply to the capacity of a rational agent (where ‘rationality’ is compatible with deterministic computation) – is to grant free will to computer programs and video game AI. Perhaps a compatibilist will bite this bullet, but I will argue that this weakens free will as a concept altogether and ablates its ability to do any important philosophical work. For instance, perhaps the most important application of free will is in attributing moral desert; this view however concedes then that computers or video game AI can be morally judged. Ultimately this also fails to address the demands  of ought implies can (unless the definition of ‘can’ is tweaked in the same manner as has been that of free will – merely ‘open to a rational agent’, although the rational agent may be mistaken in thinking an option is open!).

-	Another problem with this definition of free will, as I see it, is a kind of demarcation problem. What counts as a rational agent? What counts as undue restraint? There is no sharp conceptual line (that I can see) to be drawn between the ball-and-chain, the massive brain tumour, and the slightly deviant neurochemistry of the frontal lobes (An interesting question also is: deviant with respect to what? Deviant or non-deviant neurochemistries are equally rigorous determinants of behaviour, and if we allow that sufficiently deviant neurochemistry could be considered ‘non-free’, then according to which standard do we judge ‘normal’ neurochemistry to be free? Is free will then merely a descriptive label appropriate for a subset of people with ‘average’ neurochemistries?)

________________

I have another argument which is somewhat tangential to all of this (and kind of antecedent to considerations about determinism), which I call ‘Logical Determinism’ or ‘The Argument from Infinite Regress of the Meta-Will’ (In the spirit of self-conscious pomposity :P):

(1)	Free will is the ability to act according to one’s will without external constraint.

(2)	‘Will’ is some weighted function of the rationally ascertained and emotionally direct *desires* of an individual.

(3)	All thoughts and actions must ultimately reduce to a fundamental set of such desires (on pain of infinite regress).

(4)	The fundamental set of desires, whatever it be, is not chosen.

_______________

(5)	Therefore, the ‘will’ of free will is not itself ‘free’.

I see this as having implications for the notion of rationality compatibilists might define free will in terms of, because it exposes that even rational deliberations are rooted in unchosen primitives of desire (this is independent of physical determinism, so it could be used to counter the libertarian also). I feel this shows there ought to be no special metaphysical or moral credit given to actions decided upon by a ‘rational’ process, and hence serves as another argument in the vein that ‘compatibilism can’t do any philosophical work’.

Although I am not familiar with the doubtless extensive literature on this topic, I hope I have been clear, and I can't wait to see the responses.

EDIT: I got a lot more responses than I anticipated! Some interesting discussion here, and I'm sure I will refer to this thread for a long time to come. I will try to respond to people over time, as I digest things. For now, I come away with a strong feeling that the fight between compatibilists and hard determinists is largely verbal. I'll think about it more."
