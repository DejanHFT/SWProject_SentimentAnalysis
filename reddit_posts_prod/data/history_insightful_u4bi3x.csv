Looking for more information about the rebuilding of Warsaw after WW2,TrainofThought1,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/u4bi3x/looking_for_more_information_about_the_rebuilding/,37,660,"One for those who are focussed on urban or architectural histories... I've recently become interested in how urban spaces have been 'rebuilt' or 'reconstructed' in history following a destructive event. Looking for recommendations - books, articles, documentary videos recollecting or recounting the efforts to rebuild ruined Warsaw after the destruction wrought by bombing campaigns during World War Two. Anything I should direct my attention towards?

I've watched various Pathe video reports from the late 1940s and 1950s, but wondered if there was anything out there which was more comprehensive or narrative in format."
