Is it fair to critique a movie without finishing it?,Canucks514,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2ge9dt/is_it_fair_to_critique_a_movie_without_finishing/,10,0,I had a friend who left Boyhood after about 90 minutes because he thought it was boring. Now he wont stop talking about how terrible it is. I maintain that he can voice his opinion of how bad it is only after he's seen it all the way to the end. What do you guys think?
