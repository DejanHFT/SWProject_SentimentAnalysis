Battle of Stalingrad primary resources?,julmoip,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/9gbs6z/battle_of_stalingrad_primary_resources/,101,559,"I’m currently reading ‘Stalingrad’ by Antony Beevor which is giving me a great insight into the battle, however I would love to find more primary resources. Official records, diaries, letters etc. would be very useful for a project I’m working on; I’ll be evaluating why Germany were defeated during the battle. Any info would be greatly appreciated :) 

Edit: Any suggestions on secondary sources would be massively appreciated also! primary sources just seem much harder to come across, but secondary info will be just as useful. "
