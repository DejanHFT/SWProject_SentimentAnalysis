How do you make egg whites delicious?,alliterativehyjinks,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/s7sr7i/how_do_you_make_egg_whites_delicious/,34,1,"I feel like eggs are amazing, but for health reasons, I would like to start eliminating some or all of the yolks.  To me, unless they're making angel food, whites are bland and tasteless.  I don't mind eating them, but I would never opt for an egg white omelet.  Are there ways to still make them savory without the addition of fatty ingredients?  Any suggestions for vegetarian egg white dishes that still make you swoon?

Edit:  I almost added a special note that I DO NOT want to debate the egg yolk nutrition and now I regret it.  I am looking for recipe ideas with egg whites to help me reduce fat and cholesterol, and I really enjoy eggs and want to keep the protein, if possible.  Helpful ideas are appreciated.  Telling me I should just eat yolks is not."
