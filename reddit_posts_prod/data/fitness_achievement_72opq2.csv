How achievable is the 1000lb club within one year of training?,ThePunisherMax,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/72opq2/how_achievable_is_the_1000lb_club_within_one_year/,39,15,"I properly started lifting in April. After reading up on the fitness scene i came across the 1000 lb (454kg). It became one of my dream goals. Something i will strive for.

&nbsp;

I decided to do it in stages. Increase bench press, increase squat, increase deadlift. Rinse and repeat until i succeed.

Training program looks similar to a Bro split. With an extra day for whichever lift i am focusing on at that moment.

&nbsp;

Currently my lifts are:

110 kilo. Bench press.
190 kilo. Deadlift.
130 kilo. Squat.

&nbsp;

Im expecting my nooby gains to stop at any moment. But if i could just increase my total lifts by 20 kilos by end of the year i might join the 1000lb club.

Currently i am on a short break from increasing my lift total. Because my stamina is not keeping up with my lifts. 

And im getting more and more tired from my lifts even though i feel like i can lift heavier.

So for the next month im gonna keep my lifts as is until my stamina increases.
