"Today was the day, I just... well lost it.",_FONDLER_,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1h69oa/today_was_the_day_i_just_well_lost_it/,22,4,"Today, I went to the gym, hoping to reach a new dl max, I did. With atrocious form. My form was so bad that I burst a blood vessel in my nose and my nose bled everywhere. Completely embarrassing, not only that I had a guy come up to me(I don't speak Russian/Ukrainian and I live in Ukraine) and with broken English try to tell me my form was bad. As of today I want my DL form to be better, I'm going to find my max weight I can lift while still keeping good form. A note to anyone new, because well I still am, don't go for the heaviest weight, **ALWAYS** make sure your form is good."
