Best books on Rasputin?,NearbyAd7832,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/mco9km/best_books_on_rasputin/,8,7,"Hey guys, I've always been fascinated by Rasputin, and I've read a few books about him written in Spanish already. I believe him to be one of the most interesting characters of history .

&#x200B;

What are the best biographical books I can read about him in English (recommendations in Spanish/Portuguese also fine)? I'm particularly interested in his ability as an individual to cure haemophilia, his ability as a conversationalist and people-pleaser, and his ability to endure physical harm. 

&#x200B;

Also, I'd welcome any insightful comments into what people think of him here - particularly those of Russian descent, as I'm curious to see how 21st century Russians view Rasputin.  I assume they have views that are different from those held in the early 20th century.

&#x200B;

Any other interesting insights are also welcome - I want to learn as much as I can"
