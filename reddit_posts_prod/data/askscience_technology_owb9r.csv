How small could a nuclear (uranium and/or thorium) reactor be made using today's technology or technology in the near-future?,saintlawrence,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/owb9r/how_small_could_a_nuclear_uranium_andor_thorium/,12,4,"After watching a few TED talks back to back on prosthetics and thorium salt reactors (thanks, reddit!), I was wondering if any source of nuclear power would or could ever be made transportable enough to supplant everyday objects that are limited by constraints of battery power.  Perhaps for applications like prosthetics, vehicles, giant mobile robots, etc.  Additionally, I was wondering if it would even be efficient, much less cost-effective, at any point which I am not thinking is likely.  Sorry if this is a dumb question-I'm a med student and know nothing about anything outside of First Aid for Step 1(and little of what's inside of it, too.)"
