Delicious Chicken Pot Pie that makes 2 because you'll want 2,Helpful_Register2522,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/10l2odx/delicious_chicken_pot_pie_that_makes_2_because/,86,443,"I have made this once before. It was a huge success, and everyone wanted it the next night, which was a no-brainer because with pre-made crusts and the other half stored in the fridge, all I had to do was put it together and throw it in the oven. It was satisfying to the point where no Banquet or Marie Callanders had gone before. I'm making homemade crusts next time. I wish yall the best with this! 

Ingredients 

• 2-3 diced potatoes, peeled

• 1 cup butter, cubed 

• 1 chopped onion 

• 1 cup of all-purpose flour 

• 1-3/4 teaspoons salt 

• 1 teaspoon dried thyme 

• 3/4 teaspoon pepper 

• 3 cups chicken broth 

• 1-1/2 cups whole milk 

• 4 cups cooked chicken 

• 1 bag of mixed frozen vegetables (peas, carrots, corn) 

• 2-4 sheets pie dough 

Directions 

• Preheat oven to 425°. Place bottom pie crust in 9-in or desired size pan into the oven to par bake until lighty golden brown, 10-15 minuets. Place potatoes into a large saucepan; add water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cook, covered, 8-10 minutes or until tender; drain. 

• In a large skillet, heat butter over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until tender. Stir in flour and seasonings until blended. Gradually stir in broth and milk. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; cook and stir 2 minutes or until thickened. Stir in chicken, vegetables, and potatos into the mixture; remove from heat. 

• Add chicken mixture to your par baked bottom pie crust. Save remaining chicken filling for another pie, or make 2! Place remaining crust(s) over filling. Trim, seal, and flute edges. Cut slits in tops. The whole kit and kaboodle. 

• Bake 35-40 minutes or until crust is lightly browned. Let stand 15 minutes before cutting."
