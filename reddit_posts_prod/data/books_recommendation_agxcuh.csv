"What are book/s that you keep seeing as recommendations, which you found to be awful?",Snowflake0287,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/agxcuh/what_are_books_that_you_keep_seeing_as/,12837,11555,"I peruse this sub and a few others often. There are a few books that I see pop up a lot as recommendations and I truly dislike them. Are there any really popular book reccs that you just donâ€™t understand??

For me, (unpopular opinion, I know) I really did not enjoy House of Leaves and The Cabin at the End of the World. "
