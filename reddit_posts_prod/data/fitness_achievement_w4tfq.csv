5 reasons why eating fats will help to achieve your fitness goals,nealda,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/w4tfq/5_reasons_why_eating_fats_will_help_to_achieve/,47,76,"When we become all determined and revved up to live a healthier lifestyle, plus promising ourselves that we will never miss a workout session, sometimes there is tendency to overdo it. That means falling into a new obsession of excessively reducing fats in our diet. If adding fat to your food pushes a panic button that sends you spiralling into weight gain paranoia, I have to assure you that, in fact, your fitness goals may likely fail if you do not consume the recommended daily portion of fat.

According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005, dietary fats intake should form 20% to 35% of total calories in our food for adults aged 19 and older. The reduction of fat intake below these recommended portions over a prolonged period may adversely affect many bodily functions such as heart performance, cellular repair and endocrine health. The key dietary trick to weight loss (I call this a trick because many people wrongly think that we need to stop eating to lose weight) is to maintain a balanced diet consisting of the essential food groups i.e. carbohydrates, fats, proteins and fibres. I cannot stop stressing that maintaining a proper diet is really important in supplying nutrients that:

Support body movements and withstand impact during workouts
Secure endurance during long and moderate-to-high intensity exercises
Heal post-workout muscle fatigue rapidly
Promote health and structural development in conjunction with weight loss (so you look superbly toned and not bony)
Maintain bone strength, lubricate joints and prevent injuries.
When it boils down to eating fats, there are hundreds of articles that glorify the benefits of MUFAs or good fats i.e. monounsaturated fatty acids. These are plant-derived fats such as olive oil, avocados, chocolate (hurrah!), nuts, seeds and legumes. Another good fat is the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), also known as essential fatty acids, can sub-divided into omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids which are more popularly known as the super foods for heart health. By including MUFAs and PUFAs in your meals, they help in weight loss by:

1. Slowing down digestion

Less rapid digestion of food in the intestine means that the release of simple sugars e.g. glucose into the blood stream will likely slow down. This has the benefit of increasing the effectiveness of sugar metabolism by insulin, absorption by cells and conversion into energy. Controlling food digestion is one of the therapeutic techniques used to reduce insulin resistance in treating Type 2 diabetes.

2. Manufacture of hormones

Fats are broken down into glycerol and fatty acids through the process of hydrolysis. Fatty acids are in turn indispensable in the synthesis of hormone-like substances. While the body is able to manufacture its own fatty acids, there are 2 fatty acids essential to hormone production that needs to come from external sources. These are linoleic acid and linolenic acid.

Linoleic acid is an omega-6 fatty acid. However, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is the wonder food that has been scientifically proven to be potent in weight management. Studies have shown that CLA can lead to the reduction of body fat and increase in lean mass.

Linolenic acid is an omega-3 fatty acid that helps the body to synthesise leptin, a hormone that regulates appetite and have been proven to have a direct effect on weight loss or weight gain. An optimum leptin balance in the body is instrumental in producing the feeling of fullness and in turn suppressing appetite. Omega-3 fatty acids improve leptin sensitivity by telling the brain to make you feel fuller more quickly and stop food intake.

3. Vitamin Absorption and Utilisation

Vitamins A, D, E and K are fat-soluble vitamins. This means these vitamins use fats as a matrix for storage, absorption, activation and utilisation. While not directly linked to fat loss, these vitamins are necessary in maintaining general well-being, cellular repair, bone growth, muscular function and organ health, all extremely important in helping your body cope with changes that come with tough workouts and weight loss.

4. Source of energy

One pound of fat contains 3600 calories of energy. This and together with our bodyâ€™s affinity to fat storage makes fat the largest energy reserve in our body. It is the main fuel source for low to moderate intensity long-duration endurance exercises such as cardio workouts e.g. running, step aerobics and zumba.

5. Production of fatty acids

As mentioned earlier, the fatty acids synthesised from fat by our own are responsible for numerous physiological functions, the heart rate, blood pressure, reproduction, endocrine and nervous systems, tissue building and repair, cell nutrition and waste removal."
