AskScience AMA Series: We're NASA scientists and engineers working to understand and protect our Earth - using software and resources that are free for you to use and download. Ask us anything!,AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/15smnto/askscience_ama_series_were_nasa_scientists_and/,169,615,"[NASA's Software Catalog](https://software.nasa.gov/), located at [software.nasa.gov](https://software.nasa.gov/), is a searchable collection of all available NASA software in categories including [environmental science](https://software.nasa.gov/software/category/environmental_science_earth_air_space_exoplanet), [data and image processing](https://software.nasa.gov/software/category/data_and_image_processing), [design and integration tools](https://software.nasa.gov/software/category/design_and_integration_tools), [system testing](https://software.nasa.gov/software/category/system_testing), [crew and life support](https://software.nasa.gov/software/category/crew_and_life_support), and [autonomous systems](https://software.nasa.gov/software/category/autonomous_systems). The 2023-24 software catalog features hundreds of programs ready to be downloaded, including new codes related to satellite data.

Because sharing NASA satellite data is crucial to our mission of making NASA technologies widely available, we've also built the [Remote Sensing Toolkit](https://software.nasa.gov/remotesensing/) to help users find, analyze, and utilize the most relevant data for their research and conservation efforts. The RST is a web-based tool that pairs with the software catalog.

We're NASA scientists and engineers who use, build, test and deploy these technologies to [track the effects of climate change](https://software.nasa.gov/software/MFS-32780-1), [inform weather forecasting](https://software.nasa.gov/software/MFS-33225-1), [improve agriculture](https://software.nasa.gov/software/GSC-15469-1), and beyond. Today, we're answering your questions about the development of these technologies, sharing our experience using them, and explaining how to access free NASA resources for your scientific and academic research.

**We are:**

+ Mark Carroll, Remote Sensing Expert for LandSat 8 and 9
+ Ivona Cetinic, Scientist with the [PACE](https://pace.gsfc.nasa.gov/) (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystems) mission
+ Chris Copelan, Software Release Expert for NASA's [Technology Transfer](https://technology.nasa.gov/) program
+ Brian Day, Acting Staff Scientist for the NASA Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute and Lead for Planetary Mapping, Citizen Science, and Outreach
+ Emily Law, Lead Engineer for [Solar System Treks](https://trek.nasa.gov/)
+ Rachel Louise Tilling, Polar Scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center
+ Rodrigo Vieira Leite, Remote Sensing Forest Scientist for LandSat 8 and 9
