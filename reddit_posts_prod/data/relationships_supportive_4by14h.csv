"My little sister (17F) just got an amazing life opportunity that I want to be extremely supportive of, but my parents (66M, 53F) are making that difficult.",Healing_touch,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4by14h/my_little_sister_17f_just_got_an_amazing_life/,132,378,"Edit2 : so I'm getting a lot of the same advice about talking to my parents. Let me clarify that no conversation is going to happen, nor am I asking how to have that conversation. I have had that talk twice and both times went very sour, and I depend on my moms medical insurance for my health complications. While it is good, I'm still saddled with bills but I would be in 30k+ debt if I was on alternative insurance. I came here asking how I be a good big sister to Jessie and support her on her exciting endeavors. 

My mom is legit mental (she has some mental health stuff), her mother was an actual narcissist and there is no reasoning with someone like herself. My dad is protecting himself and his health and my sisters health too by keeping waters calm. There's a lot of nuance and stuff I haven't touched here because it wasn't really necessary. 

Edit: a couple people asked for more back story so I'm reposting a comment from below. Trying to keep the emotional info out because that's a whole bigger post

""Well...it's a long story. My mom sort of hates me because when I was a baby, I was the light of my dad's life and she hated the fact that I ""stole him away"" from her. Yes she has told me that multiple times. She says it as a joke, but the resentment is obviously still there.

I also look like my mom's sister who she didn't like, but Jessie is a spitting image of my mom at any age. I think my mom sees Kathy in me and holds a lot of her past grudges against me. My dad thinks it's as absurd as I do. 

I'm avoiding some details because it gets really sad and horrible for awhile. But my mom has always given Jessie the same or better than me, at a younger age, I think to make up for the wrongs of her own childhood? ""

There is a ton of backstory that is almost impossible to share without writing a novel so I will write the bullet points below:

-When I (currently 23F) was 12-16, I was pretty much predominantly raising my younger sister with my dad because my mom was off the rails (intense rage, disappear for weeks, they'd fight/she'd fight with me, everything was everyone else's fault). So my Sis (Jessie) and I have a pseudo mom/daughter/sister relationship. Taught her how to use tampons and about periods and ect ect ( lots of stuff I shouldn't have had to).
-when growing up I had to have a job and while they would help pay for things, i was paying for a lot on my own. 
-I ended up dropping out of college because I was too sick with my first round of cancer and didn't have the funds (I was paying almost solely out of pocket).

Okay, so yesterday after seeing my folks they announced to me that they're sending my sister to Europe next year as a graduation present. Which is totally amazing and I'm excited for her, but this is the exact same trip they denied me going on when I graduated, because they said I had to pay 80% of the trip myself. The trip costs 3500, and their financial situation hasn't changed. Now while I would normally chalk it up to whatever, this is almost my last straw.

Over the past 5 years after moving out, they've helped me with school expenses about 7 grand, which is a loan not a gift that I've almost entirely paid off. But over the summer they announced that they have a savings account for my sister that totals over 60k for school, and recently I discovered she has another 15k sitting waiting for her eventual wedding. They didn't have either available for me.

I'm not saying I'm expecting my parents to do everything and give me 75k in cash, and I'm so thrilled that my sister is going to have this opportunity and not have to worry about student loans. But now I'm starting to feeling a nagging pang in the pit of my stomach when I think about all of it. My sister has never had a job (or after school activities) and my parents are funding this entirely themselves.

Ultimately I want to be happy and a supportive older sister, but I'm having a hard time tempering that with seeing her get all the things my parents flat out denied me, and the hardest part is knowing I won't be able to afford to finish my degree within the next 5 years because of my medical bills, which then makes me have to think about even if I am going to finish because my boyfriend and I want to be married and start our family by then. 

I don't know how to manage these complicated emotions and would like an outside set of eyes.

TL;DR I want to be a supportive older sister to Jessie over this amazing opportunity, but I'm feeling conflicted watching her do all the things I wish I could have done but my parents denied me. Help me quash my ugly feelings to be a better older sis!!
