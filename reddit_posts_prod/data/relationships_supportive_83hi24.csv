My BF 24M isn’t acting supportive of me 22F trying to lose weight.,throwaway031018,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/83hi24/my_bf_24m_isnt_acting_supportive_of_me_22f_trying/,18,7,"Hey Reddit. 

Posted this earlier but it got removed due to lack of a tl;dr.  Trying to post again hope this works. 

I am trying to lose some weight. We had our first baby a few months ago and I gained a lot of weight during the pregnancy. I am finally getting serious about slimming back down. 

My boyfriend gets upset when I suggest we eat at home (not legit upset just gives me a hard time).  He will do his best to convince me to go out to eat with him instead of eating the food I meal prepped. He also tears me down when I am happy after a workout saying that what I did wasn’t enough and it’s not going help meet any weight loss goals. 

I am very easily convinced to eat out and I know part of this is just poor self discipline. I don’t know how to make it clear I am unhappy with how I look and want to make a change.  

I am so hurt and frustrated because he is normally the most supportive person. This is not normal behavior for him and I don’t know what to do. 

tl;dr - boyfriend isn’t supportive of me trying to lose weight. "
