Linguists of reddit- How far back in history could a modern English speaker go and still effectively be able to communicate?,jlinback,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/320in5/linguists_of_reddit_how_far_back_in_history_could/,683,2168,"I think about this whenever I see a movie character time travel back to the 18th or 19th century and communicate without issue. Considering how much the English language has changed over the past few centuries, how far back in history could someone really go and still understand the English being spoken?

EDIT: WOW! I really appreciate everyone's insight here! It looks like the consensus is the 16th century or possibly 15th century is about as far back as a modern English speaker could go and still be able to communicate. I definitely learned a lot from everyone's comments. "
