We need to talk about Melody AM by Röyksopp,Gramathon910,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/vlqfca/we_need_to_talk_about_melody_am_by_röyksopp/,1,4,"This album is just impeccable, and I have yet to meet someone who didn’t enjoy at least one song from it (with the most popular being *Remind Me* of course!). What really does it for me, though, is the final song. 

[*40 Years Back \ Come*](https://youtu.be/E_R-Aa9iMyc) begins with a cerebral and bassy beat that feels a little unnatural, but that’s not what I’m here to discuss. The second “part” of the song is an experience I’ve found nowhere else in music. It truly makes me wonder why life *is*, you know? I’ve had multiple people tear up on their first listen for no reason other than the pure emotion that the song evokes. 

It feels nostalgic, like a sound I heard in my dreams growing up. It feels like the years gone and the years to come, all put together in this repetitive, deep echo. 

I’m not quite sure how to explain it, but give the album a listen. It’ll change your life ;)"
