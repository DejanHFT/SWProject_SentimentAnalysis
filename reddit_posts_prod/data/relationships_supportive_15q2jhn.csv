My Boyfriend Didn't Make Himself Available When I Asked Him To Be Supportive And Now I Feel Like Cheating,Immediate_Topic9956,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15q2jhn/my_boyfriend_didnt_make_himself_available_when_i/,62,23,"TLDR: my 29F boyfriend 38M was dismissive of my concerns about my grandma, who was alone in a bad neighborhood and dealing with emotional pain.. He refused to go with me and refused to get on the phone to offer me some type of support, yet he showed up  uninvited ( after I was back home from the ordeal) and had his family come  over without my consent (to eat food that I bought for myself). Because I kicked him out, he keeps texting me to remind me that I promised to help him start a business. I can't control my impuslyto give him a lesson.


I ( f 29) come from a close knit family. Two years ago, my entire family moved to a single property out of state. For the past months, I'd been worried about my grandmother. I had been begging boyfriend ( M38) to accompany me to go see her because she lived in a not so great neighborhood. He refused. I asked him if he could at least stay on the phone with me while I went to see her because I had anxiety. My parents had been planning on taking a trip to bring her to live with them. My Grandpa is recovering from surgery at my family's new location ( long story). My grandma has a fear of airplanes so that has been a factor to delay her move. 

Without too much detail, I followed my instinct and went on my own. I spent two weeks helping her organize everything and convinced her to sell her home to a buyer who's interested. I ended up realizing my grandma has anxiety, was frightened and overall really sad but kept all this from us. Her parents had flown to help my parents care for my grandpa, who's fortunately recovering and gaining strength. I also didn't want my parents to take the trip because they are not street wise. I had days that felt longer than 24 hours. Sending all of grandma's pets was a whole project, then changing the mailing address, canceling stuff, getting the movers to show up at night because we didn't want to call attention. I delegated a lawyer that I hired and also had to deal with switching her health insurance and helping her close her bank account and open a new one at a different bank for security reasons. At no point did my boyfriend ever show empathy or concern. 

I had to take Grandma on a sleeper train because she hates flying and honestly, driving would be exhausting. We arrived safely. My family was surprised and got emotional because grandma was our relative that remained in a vulnerable situation and we had been trying to solve it. I have been getting updates on the house sale so that my grandparents get their payment, picking up their  pets and scheduling the movers delivery.

I got on a flight, tired AF and my boyfriend showed no intention of listening to anything I had to share. 
Fine. I bought 60 pounds of seafood boil  to have my own private ""binge"". My boyfriend showed up, asks for some of it which I shared begrudgingly because he didn't even announce that he was coming after so much silence. I got to the bathroom while he's with his brother on the phone. I'm out of the shower, come back into the dining room,  and find his brother and brother's gf eating my food that I had put away before taking a shower. I give my boyfriend a look and he gets defensive. I know this is not my finest moment but I clarified that this is my food that I purchased for myself as a reward for some stressful days and that I needed them to stop eating it. They could finish what was already in their hands but everything else needed to be put back in the freezer. They finished eating and left in silence. My boyfriend got really angry and attempted to lecture me on how to treat his family. I closed the door on his face as I'm drained and he never bothered to ask about my family. 

He's been texting me like crazy and showing concern about the company I've been helping him set up. I'm tempted to pull the rug and pull the plug. I'm just thankful that I had sent my cats to live with my family earlier because sometimes I'm out for days and his attitude tells me that he might not be the best person to rely on for anything. His SIL texted me with an apology which I accepted, but that affected me so much that I started sobbing. I feel guilty and have nothing against her, but they also showed up unannounced and this is not my boyfriend's place. I feel stupid and dirty and lonely. I'm so angry I'm fantasizing about cheating. I know this is wrong but I just feel like he needs a lesson in decency.

Edit: we've been together 3 years"
