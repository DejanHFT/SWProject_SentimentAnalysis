What is the single scientific discovery you most want to see in your lifetime?,peteyH,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/a9zdb/what_is_the_single_scientific_discovery_you_most/,3555,854,"Please identify one and elaborate if you have to. Upvote those you support.

**EDIT**: I submitted this thinking I'd get downvoted/ignored into oblivion, but 2500+ comments - wow, awesome!

So it looks like the **TOP SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES REDDITORS WANT TO SEE IN THEIR LIFETIMES,** in order of votes received, are: (1) immortality, (2) alien life with which we could meaningfully communicate, (3) a cure for cancer, cheap/clean/abundant renewable energy (e.g., fusion), (4) warp drive, (5) affordable female android sex slaves. Honorable mention goes to (6) room temperature superconductor, (7) holodeck, (8) strong AI-level singularity, (9) space elevator, (10) antigravity, and (11) some scientific demonstration or indication of the existence of God.

Let's all report back here around 2020 and 2030 - hopefully we'll be able to scratch a few off the list.

Thanks for participating :D"
