"Building a ground deck on top of concrete and asphalt, am I thinking the right way?",DIYno0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/uy6eqq/building_a_ground_deck_on_top_of_concrete_and/,73,437,"I want to extend the deck on my porch. Right now i have a piece of concrete and asphalt and it looks quite ugly. I want to add composite decking boards (the same ones I have on my porch) and wanted to bounce my approach to check if what I want to do make sense. I am located in Massachusetts for reference

Here is my design: [Deck design](https://imgur.com/a/IMpo6fr)

1. I am planning to use 1x2 or 2x4 pressure treated ground--contract lumber to put the composite decking boards on. Using 2x4 would make the deck 3 inches higher (first step is 7in high) and therefore would prefer 1x2 so it is only 2 inches high total (decking board in 1in thick)
2. To fix them to the ground, i would use a galvanized steel corner brace (i'd like to get a U share, but somehow cannot find them) that would be anchored int he concrete and asphalt. Due to L shape, I would put the 2 on the edges facing in one way, and the one in the middle facing the other way (so piece of lumber is well positioned).
3. then I would place the decking board with hidden spacers the same way they are mounted on my deck
4. i will extend the deck to go over the grass (\~3 feet) and will build a frame with concrete foundations.

My questions are:

* even thought the wood is pressure treated and ground contact designed, will it quickly rot as touching the concrete and asphalt?
* anything that I would be watching out?
* is there a better way to achieve what I want to do?

Thank you!"
