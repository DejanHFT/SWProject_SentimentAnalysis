Yet another backhole question...,renots,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/gg4os/yet_another_backhole_question/,27,9,"Let's first discard some stuff as realistically as possible: 1. I'm an AI on a sufficiently small device such that tidal forces won't affect me. 2. I have enough power on me that I can dive into a BH perpendicular to its surface (as opposed to going in spiral).

Let's say I tell my friend Herpina to stay at a finite distance from a black hole while I go in it. She knows math and can calculate the time I'll take to hit the singularity (say 5 minutes). But as I reach event horizon, I'll freeze in time as my speed will â†’ c (according to *her* ofcourse, for me I'll be just freely falling). Now at 4:59, we both know in 1 second I'll hit singularity; we both know that I have crossed event horizon; we both know that according to her when I crossed event horizon my speed wrt her would have been >c.

Even if we will now never be able to compare notes, even if she still sees me frozen in time outside of even horizon, don't we both know this to be true?"
