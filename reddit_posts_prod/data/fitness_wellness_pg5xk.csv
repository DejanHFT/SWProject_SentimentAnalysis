Well-read Wednesdays: underappreciated routine edition. ,Noedel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/pg5xk/wellread_wednesdays_underappreciated_routine/,99,44,"[Last weeks](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/p6174/wellread_wednesdays_an_act_to_counter_moronic/) edition resulted in some pretty interesting reads on general fitness topics. Some of them were quite a surprise. The favorites:

**This weeks topic**


Last week, a lot of posts were about nutrition and weight loss. Surprisingly few were actually about training technique, routines or alternatives to SS. 

This week I ask you to deliver information on under appreciated workout routines. SS or 5/3/1 are not the only routines in the book. What else is there? 

Questions you could ask yourself: is SS really suitable for all kinds of beginners? What routines do you see as a great alternative? Is 3*5 reps really the way to go? Do you have a hatred for the low bar squat? Let it be known!

I am looking forwards to the results.

**Guidelines**

* Welcome materials: external sources like articles and books, but also videos or blog posts.

* The subject is just a general direction. You can also bring in other interesting reads if you like.

* Try to give a tl;dr of the article that you found.

* You can send in an article to share, but also ask for the validity of an article you're unsure about. Make this clear in your post. 

* Please respect each-others opinion. They will differ. Try to be a scholar and a gentleman/women.
