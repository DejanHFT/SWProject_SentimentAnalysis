"Me [29F] with my husband [29M] been married less than a year, I'm pregnant and I thought he'd be more supportive",ngtastic,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22fufv/me_29f_with_my_husband_29m_been_married_less_than/,141,267,"Edit: [Here's the link to the UPDATE] (http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/251unz/update_me_29f_with_my_husband_29m_been_married/)


I am about 7 weeks pregnant. We have been together for 3 years and have been trying to get pregnant basically since the wedding day about 8 months ago. We had all these grand plans about kids and he *was* super supportive. 

Now that I'm actually pregnant, I feel like he's a totally selfish dick. And he feels like he's not getting enough credit. It's crazy. I thought when I got pregnant he'd be there for me. Now when I'm nauseous and insanely tired (basically all the time for the last few weeks) he disappears and just says shit like, ""That's how it goes when you're pregnant. Get used to it,"" or ""Stop laying around. Go outside and get some exercise."" When I'm puking and tired, I don't really have the energy to go outside and get exercise. And when I ask him to get me some water or something to eat, he does it, but he does it begrudgingly and seems like he wants brownie points for it. Oh, he also makes me feel guilty for not having sex with him when I'm nauseous! Asks for it all the time and is annoyed when sometimes I just can't. I've even give him blowjobs (near puking) just to make him happier. And then I'm just annoyed that he's expecting that of me when I feel so terrible. 

In the meantime, he's working, playing baseball, video games, working out, and super focused on himself. I actually have barely seen him since we found out. I guess I just thought he'd be more supportive, or even excited, to be a part of the process. If I have to carry this kid, I'd want him to want to help as much as he can. I also thought being pregnant wouldn't be so difficult so immediately. I definitely feel like there's an alien inside me, everything is uncomfortable and painful, and I'm always on the edge of starving or throwing up. I know that's not fun to be around, but it's definitely not fun to be, either.

Does anyone know if this experience is normal? He's always been a loving and supportive guy and super excited about kids. And now, when it gets real and we're really pregnant, he's MIA and we're just on totally different pages. Maybe when he actually starts to see a bump, he'll be more on board and helpful? Hopefully?!

**tl;dr**: I thought my husband would be more supportive when we got pregnant."
