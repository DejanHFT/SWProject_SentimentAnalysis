"Can I ask my friend to be more supportive? If so, how?",pluckywidgeon,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/iaipp2/can_i_ask_my_friend_to_be_more_supportive_if_so/,2,4,"I (30F) have been close friends with M (24F) for just over a year. We've had a ton of interesting conversations in the last twelve months, ranging from religion to abortion to health care policy. While we don't always see eye to eye, I've always finished these conversations feeling like we still respect each other and we can see where the other is coming from.

Then, this spring, I bought a house on a piece of farmland. I've dreamed about living out in the countryside since I was age 10 or so, and though I moved onto this land too late in the spring to do anything except buy a few chickens and put in an 8'x12' veggie garden, I have big plans for next year. I know it'll take awhile to build up the land to this scale, but I eventually want to have a ""teaching farm"" with plots of corn, pumpkins, wheat, sunflowers, cotton, and peanuts. My plan is that I can host the usual crowds of folks wanting to pick their own pumpkins and sunflowers, and also I can host school groups who can come and learn about where their food comes from and a little bit about the history of the area.

I'm very excited about this plan. My friend M is ... not.  She is very anti-farming. Even my veggie garden freaks her out --- she does not want to know where her food comes from or what it looks like before it hits the shelves at Target, full stop. She openly fantasizes about cutting off my chickens' heads, and has made remarks about ""what you could do when your farm fails.""

These remarks of hers really bother me. I really want to make this farm a success, and while I respect that she doesn't like outdoorsy work, I'd appreciate a little more moral support. Am I too demanding for wanting that? If not, what's the best way to bring this up and discuss it with her?

TL; DR: Friend openly despises my farm; can I/how do I ask her to tone down her rhetoric?"
