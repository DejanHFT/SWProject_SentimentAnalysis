"I made a four hours long multi-genre Spotify playlist of ""Uplifting Space Music""",silentedge92,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/49ysv5/i_made_a_four_hours_long_multigenre_spotify/,358,4111,"I made a spotify playlist to listen to as I work, since it came out quite interesting I thought I'd share it with you. :) 

It's based on music that would work greatly as a soundtrack for a journey into space, in my opinion. 
I tried to keep it quite dynamic, both in terms of song intensity and genres. 

Links to the playlist:

**EDIT:** Woha, this quickly became my most appreciated reddit post ever, glad you guys like the playlist so much! 

I believe I'll keep updating it, and I'm considering the idea of making other playlists in the future with completely different themes. Would you guys be interested in that? :) "
