[UPDATE 2] Need help getting something done? I have unlimited flight benefits this summer and want to spend my summer helping out Redditors,Generique,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/us2v2/update_2_need_help_getting_something_done_i_have/,488,1244,"If you have no idea what I'm talking about: [Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/svoy6/need_help_getting_something_done_i_have_unlimited/) and [Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t9zr9/update_need_help_getting_something_done_i_have/)

Hey Reddit.  This adventure has been going really well so far- in the last 4 weeks I've met 43 Redditors, completed 20 missions across 5 cities, and have made all 14 of my flights non-rev (not counting a flight to new york I missed due to traffic).   The missions so far have ranged from teaching English in rural Thailand to doing motion-capture for Valve to washing a car for a family whose child has Down Syndrome and is beating Leukemia to watching IMMVP beat ST_Squirtle live at the GSL Code S Starcraft II finals.  
I've taken the last week off to make a plan for the footage (and to play Diablo to be honest) but I'm leaving tomorrow morning for [Columbus, Ohio to attend a LAN Party](http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/usjqs/dear_columbus_i_am_in_your_city_for_the_weekend/) and to continue the adventure.  You can follow future updates on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheReVenture) and [r/ReVenture](http://www.reddit.com/r/reventure/), and tweets on [twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/RedthePirate).

Since people always ask, I can fly non-rev (meaning if there empty seats on a flight I can get on and only pay certain international airport taxes - but for the most part the travel is completely free).  Because flights can fill up overnight and other people in the airline can non-rev too, I can't always travel anywhere.  For instance I was going to go [hiking in Morocco](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/svoy6/need_help_getting_something_done_i_have_unlimited/c4hfruo) two weeks ago but the connection from New York to Madrid got overbooked at that last minute, so instead I went to Seoul to watch the GSL Finals.  With the number of missions you guys have given, there's always somewhere I can fly to and do things!  I have been continuously amazed by how kind people are - other than two nights in hostel in bangkok I've been staying at (mostly) stranger's houses and relying on them as tour guides.
