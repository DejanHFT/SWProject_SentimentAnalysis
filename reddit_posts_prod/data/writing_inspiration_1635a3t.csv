Is there a term for when inspiration kicks in and you can't stop writing?,Iceblader,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1635a3t/is_there_a_term_for_when_inspiration_kicks_in_and/,25,17,"Three days ago I overcame a writing block and continue writing my book. I have written over 50 pages in that time and I think I can go on. What happens is that I feel that I have neglected (not much) other areas of my life such as university tasks and personal health (I have skipped meals and I have not slept very well).  
  
I would like to know if there is a term, either colloquial or scientific, for when this happens, something like ""writer's fever"" or ""inspiration rush""."
