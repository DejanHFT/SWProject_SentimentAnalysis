"Teen here. I love space, astronomy, and engineering. What can I do to continue my passion at a young age?",NotSlimJimm,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/nrneyt/teen_here_i_love_space_astronomy_and_engineering/,61,20,"So I'm a teenager, and have just discovered a passion for space! I find it fascinating while at the same time exciting and full of potential. I get straight A's (Not to flex lol), and do well in basically every subject. I've recently started feeling that I wanted to continue this passion of space, to do something with it, BUT I don't know how. Any ideas?   
Thanks!!!"
