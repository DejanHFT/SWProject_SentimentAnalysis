Going and exploring US National Parks ALONE,wangjohn6996,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/12my27v/going_and_exploring_us_national_parks_alone/,12,7,"I live in a small rural town in Michigan, USA. I have friends but we donâ€™t share the same interests and most of them are busy married people lol. Gained some kind of interest and fascination to US National Parks and I wanna visit National Parks alone. I might start with Indiana Dunes, Cuyahoga Valley, River Gorge and Mammoth Cave since these 4 are the closest to my location.

Has anyone tried this yet? is it safe? I would welcome inputs and suggestions from you guys. Thanks!"
