"I'm doing a thesis on Tocqueville's Democracy in America, will r/history give me their insight on the subject?",meatvision,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/ibe0r/im_doing_a_thesis_on_tocquevilles_democracy_in/,16,18,"I haven't finished reading the book, but I'm about halfway through the first volume. Are any of you knowledgeable on the book or Tocqueville? What are some of your personal experiences or opinions on the subject? I've just been reading and taking notes, but is there a mindset in which I should approach the book? Thanks for all of your insight!"
