Struggling with going out of my comfort zone and dealing with my inspiration,Hotshotrollins122,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/142ys43/struggling_with_going_out_of_my_comfort_zone_and/,7,13,"So 

Topic one.

I developed a very comfortable style of inner monologues and letters, really stuff from the characters POV.

I find this extremely frustrating, but as we'll come to in a moment my brain is a bit of a prick, in this instance I fall into routine and habit really easy.

I've tried writing things in different ways but it turns out terrible and I lack confidence doing it.

I really don't know what to do here.


Topic two.

As previously stated I don't like my brain much, this is another reason..

I fall into inspiration extremely easy, but I can't stick to it, at the moment after watching the godfather, I really really want to write a mafia thing, but I know I won't stick to it, because I know that my brain will fall in love with something else in a week.

Really I just need any advice on what to do about it."
