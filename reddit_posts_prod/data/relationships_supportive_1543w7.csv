This thread got way out of hand. I wanted to clarify things and do a little update.  I got a ton of responses. Most of them were encouraging, some of them were just ridiculous. Let me clarify that I love constructive criticism. That is always, ALWAYS appreciated. What is unnecessary is people just filling in the gaps with their own agendas. A lot of the posters/commentors claimed a lot of things that I never wrote, ever. 

To answer your questions:


Am I forcing him to do anything? Nope never said I would. Said repeatedly that I wouldn’t. 


Someone wrote…


**but if she makes it so he is not legally liable for the child on any level...
but she can't do that. no 'contract' she could write up would stand up in court. the only way she can let him off the hook is to claim she does not know who the father is (leave him off the birth certificate) and she's not willing to do that. she's outright refused to do that.**


NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT A BIRTH CERITFICATE. This commentor is completely making it up. Never mentioned it ever. Actually, since I didn’t mention it at all, let me clarify that I am not putting his name on anything. Ever. Never planned on it.   
Did he know you didn’t want kids? Yes! Repeatedly told him. Even told him when he proposed that I would never get an abortion. Just like I knew his stance, he knew mine.


 Why does his stance matter more than mine? 


Did you purposely not take your birth control? No. He went with me to every single appointment for my BC shot. Every single one. He saw me get the shot. I can’t fake that. And we used a condom every time. 
So how did you get pregnant? Nothing is 100%. Every time you have sex you run a risk. We took the precautions that we could, but on the packages and leaflets on our methods there are listed fail rates. The shot runs the risk of failing because some people don’t take to hormonal methods of birth control. My doctor confirmed this. My fiancé never had any doubt that I wasn’t taking precautions.


Someone wrote..

 **They used birth control even though she was seemingly sterile and at this point entering menopause. There is absolutely no way you can blame him for not expecting this.**


Entering menopause or about to enter menopause doesn’t automatically make me sterile. I had numerous pregnancies in the past. Obviously I was far from sterile. 
Then why was she using birth control? For the hell of it? He asked me to. I thought it wasn’t an issue because of the menopause thing and the BC. I figured it wouldn’t do any harm. 


Someone wrote…


**Then she'll have to be a single mum and raise a kid who will most likely get screwed up with deep daddy issues. What a selfish bitch, cares more about her own urges than raising a kid in a healthy environment.**


So all kids raised by single parents have deep daddy issues? Were you raised by a single parent? Do you have deep daddy issues? Why am I a selfish bitch for wanting to bring a kid into this world and love it. I have the money, I have the support, I have the good, stable, job, I have the time, I have the effort. I am much more prepared for this than any one else ever.


Someone wrote…


 **I read elsewhere in the thread she may still hit him up for money.
I never wrote that. Someone else assumed that and wrote down that they thought I would. I never said that ever. That actually runs completely contradictory to what I said.** 


**But you are saddling him with a kid that he doesn’t want to exist?** 

So, what is you alternative? Have an abortion? Because that is the only compromise here. Either he gets his way or I keep the baby. In the same way, why would he ask me to get rid of a kid he knows I have been trying to have forever? He knows I want kids. Why does he get what he wants? Why do his needs matter above mine? 

Someone wrote..


**He trusted someone who was apparently onboard with this.
I made it repeatedly clear to him that I wasn’t on board and would never get an abortion. He never trusted I would. We discussed it at length. He knew I wouldn’t ever.** 


**Why don’t you sign away his rights?** 

Because that is not how the law works. At least not in my state. I can’t just draft a paper and have him sign away that. I couldn’t even get a lawyer to do it because it wouldn’t be legal in my state. For the courts to recognize his right to terminate his parental rights I would have to remarry and have that person adopt the baby. 

**So then remarry and do that?** Yeah. Ok. I will just head right out and marry the first guy I see and have him take over the rights to the kid. It’ll be no problem. Come on. You are adults. You know it doesn’t work like that. 


Someone wrote…

 **you've said repeatedly in this thread, whenever anyone mentions that if you really wanted to absolve him of his responsibility you could only do it by not putting him down as the father, that you will not do that and that you feel he should have to deal with the consequences becuse he 'stuck his dick in you for 2 years'. and i agree, and so does the law, he IS legally responsible. but i wish you would stop portraying yourself as the poor put-upon victim while claiming to be doing nothing that will alter his life in any way.**


Never did I play the victim. It took two people to make this kid. One isn’t in it. Fine. I got this myself. I had a tough history of pregnancy. I think I have a right to be mad at him for asking me to abort it. Just as he has a right to be mad that I would not get an abortion. You made the villain. I never once portrayed myself as a victim here. 


Someone wrote..

**To be fair we only have one side of the story in which she is not going to put herself in a negative light. From what she said the guy is handling it poorly but she hasn't exactly been upfront with him either with something that whether he likes it or not will change his life.**

I actually will provide his side in the comments. Although I suspect people will then call me liar. You have no reason to believe me, but you have no reason to doubt either. Read his side below or not. I honestly don’t care. 

**Someone wrote about him not wanting a kid out there ever.** Again, you are assuming. I never said anything. He said he didn’t want kids because they were hard, not that he didn’t want anyone out their with his DNA ever. He has donated sperm before so that probably already happened.    


So, to clarify again. He doesn’t have to do anything. I never requested him anything but a parting of ways. I never said  I claim him as the father. I never said I would force him to do anything. Other people said that to further their agendas, their points. It is so easy to create what you want to see out of any situation. I know he is scared and confused and it is tough on him. I know this. It sucks for both us. 


We both made ridiculously bad choices in this, but they are choices we knowingly made together. 


I never asked anybody their opinion on the abortion. I wanted to know how to deal with a break and make it easier for my fiancé. So he could find peace and be happy with whatever choice he made. How does that make me a selfish bitch? How does that make me a bad person? 
I got a lot of supportive responses and those were nice. Thank you to everyone how offered real advice and constructive criticism without assuming and filling in the gaps with their own agenda. 

Now for the update..

He called again. This time I confronted him about his constant calls about the abortion. He admitted that was a bit mean and unnecessary. We met up. We talked. Really talked. He is confused and scared and so am I. We talked about why he didn’t want a child. We talked about why I did. We talked about why I didn’t tell him. We talked about our relationship. We talked about what we wanted in the future. We had talked about this all before but never in this context. 

He accepted I would never get an abortion. He was fine with that. After the smoke cleared and with the feelings back to calm he was able to see my reasoning. And I understood his. This man isn’t an ass or villain. Neither am I. We are just too people who now have a situation where a big decision has to be made, and we are trying to handle that as best that we can. 

He came home that night (last night). To clarify, we had this discussion last evening. Things are going to be tough for us to both adjust to for a time. He wants in my life. He loves me. He isn’t going to leave when things get tough because, “ that isn’t the man I am.” We made a few concessions/compromises. I am not getting an abortion because that wouldn’t be a compromise. We are having the baby. We are still getting married in March. I am giving him a bit more space and patience for adjusting to the baby. It will take him time. Hell, it’ll take me time. We are waiting until 20 weeks to tell his family so that we don’t get anyone too hopeful. If we miscarry, we won’t try again. We can try adoption later (before I turn 45) If this baby comes to term, they will have the most loving parents ever who will raise it together.     

Things worked out. And I am happy with the results. I am happy that he has found peace and that I don’t have to choose between my future husband and my baby. Until then we both move forward to looking towards a hopeful future. He has actually gotten a little bit excited. Said the kid had to go to his university so he could start a tradition. Although, I would rather they got to mine ( Smith!). 

And more importantly, this kid is going to be so wanted and loved by his parents, and some many other people.   

Again, thanks for all the support! Some people sent me some amazing and lovely private messages that I plan to answer very soon because it means a lot to me that you took the time to care and read about my situation. Even if you couldn’t offer advice, you made my day and helped me remain calm until he and I could sort the situation out. People make ridiculously choices and say ridiculous things when under pressure. I know he shouldn’t have pressured me into an abortion. He admits is wrong there. I should have told him immediately. I was wrong for that. We understand we should have really, really taken into account each other’s stance. We messed up. We are human. But it happened and now we are making the best of it. 

I plan to update again near the end of the pregnancy to let everyone know how it went. Also, I am already bumping! I have a very thin and short so I am already showing. YAY! Keep your fingers crossed that this one is my lucky one. Thank you! 

On a side note: Does anyone know a good place in Washington to get any of those wonderfully amazing pregnancy pants? I want to try them on first. I remember those being so comfy.
