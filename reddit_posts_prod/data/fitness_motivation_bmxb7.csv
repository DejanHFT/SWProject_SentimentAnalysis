What is your best way to self-motivate?,lapetitemarie,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/bmxb7/what_is_your_best_way_to_selfmotivate/,52,8,"I know that I need to be active and I like being active.  I enjoy doing physical activity with friends and will not hesitate to participate with them.  If I pay for a class I have no problem attending because of the money that would be lost otherwise.  The problem is that I can't push myself to actually get up and go do it on my own, I have no intrinsic motivator.  I need help and I'm asking you r/fitness, what is your intinsic motivator and how did you find it?"
