Gardasil vaccine efficacy in women 26-45?,arbolesdefantasia,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2apyva/gardasil_vaccine_efficacy_in_women_2645/,4,1,"Gardasil is not currently FDA recommended for women 26-45. I've read here that the reason is that it isn't efficacious. is this correct? can someone help translate these findings? http://www.fda.gov/downloads/biologicsbloodvaccines/vaccines/approvedproducts/ucm111263.pdf

> 14.7 Studies in Women 27 Through 45 Years of Age 
Study 6 evaluated efficacy in 3253 women 27 through 45 years of age based on a combined endpoint 
of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related persistent infection, genital warts, vulvar and vaginal dysplastic lesions of 
any grade, CIN of any grade, AIS, and cervical cancer. These women were randomized 1:1 to receive 
either GARDASIL or AAHS control. The efficacy for the combined endpoint was driven primarily by 
prevention of persistent infection. There was no statistically significant efficacy demonstrated for CIN 2/3, 
AIS, or cervical cancer. In post hoc analyses conducted to assess the impact of GARDASIL on the 
individual components of the combined endpoint, the results in the population of women na√Øve to the 
relevant HPV type at baseline were as follows: prevention of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related persistent 
infection (80.5% [95% CI: 68.3, 88.6]), prevention of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related CIN (any grade) 
(85.8% [95% CI: 52.4, 97.3]), and prevention of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related genital warts (87.6% [95% 
CI: 7.3, 99.7]). 
Efficacy for disease endpoints was diminished in a population impact assessment of women who were 
vaccinated regardless of baseline HPV status (full analysis set). In the full analysis set (FAS), efficacy was 
not demonstrated for the following endpoints: prevention of HPV 16- and 18-related CIN 2/3, AIS, or 
cervical cancer and prevention of HPV 6- and 11-related condyloma. No efficacy was demonstrated 
against CIN 2/3, AIS, or cervical cancer in the general population irrespective of HPV type (FAS any type 
analysis)

yet, why does this study find that it is effective?
