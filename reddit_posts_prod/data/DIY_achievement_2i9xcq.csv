Tips on achieving a smoother bevel when using router to finish edges?,alonjar,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/2i9xcq/tips_on_achieving_a_smoother_bevel_when_using/,8,0,"I find that I'm getting a slight bumpy or wavy texture to my edges when trying to create a rounded bevel with my router.  The bumps or waves are very shallow, too insignificant to notice at a glance, but just enough to really piss me off when looking close from the proper angle, or if you run your finger along the edge quickly.

Is this usually a sign of improper technique in some way?   Am I perhaps moving too fast, or too slow, or need to up the RPMs?

I havent been able to figure it out.  Sanding the beveled edge after routing is somewhat effective, but still makes it difficult to achieve the perfect edge i'm looking for, and I'd like to avoid all the extra elbow grease."
