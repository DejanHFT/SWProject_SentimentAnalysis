"3 hour layover in Copenhagen. Is that enough time to Uber to city center, explore, and make it back?",LukeNuts,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16rp1g5/3_hour_layover_in_copenhagen_is_that_enough_time/,19,0,"Wife and I are flying from Norway to California, with a 3 to 4 hour layover in Copenhagen. Thought it might be fun to find an Uber and explore the town a bit, then rush back and catch our flight, but it seems risky. 

Has anyone tried this in CPH?"
