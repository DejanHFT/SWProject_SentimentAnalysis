Exploring Egypt by car,zubrCr,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/10sfkny/exploring_egypt_by_car/,23,0,"Hi,

I want to explore Egypt by rental car, starting from Cairo but am seeking your advice regarding the road conditions and average travel times for the following routes:

1) Cairo to Abu Mena Heritage Site (in north)

2) Cairo to Wadi Hitan National Park

3) Wadi Hitan to Luxor

4) Luxor to Abu Simbel

&#x200B;

Can you tell me how the roads for these 4 routes are and which travel time in hours I can expect by car?

Thanks"
