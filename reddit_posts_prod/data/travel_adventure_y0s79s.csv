Feeling its time for an adventure...,Excellent-Ad-2443,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/y0s79s/feeling_its_time_for_an_adventure/,1,1,"Looking for a bit of advise...

i want to take a couple of months off to travel, im lucky to have an understanding employer who will give me time off work, provided its not feb-mar as thats our busy time and an understanding partner, who i think will enjoy a bit of ME time

Thinking maybe a month around Europe and a month around Asia, maybe with a couple of days stop overs on the way there/back to break the trip up.  I would probably opt to do tours as i travel much better when its pre-organised, less stress

Im from New zealand and anything involving going to these destinations you want to make it worth while as its LONG trips on planes

How much do you think i would need spending wise?  this is once my flights, insurance, accommodation and tours are already paid for?

i did something similar in my late 20s but things have gone up in price since and this was a very tight trip where i had to count my pennies, think i went for around 6 weeks and used 10k, again once my tour, accommodation and flights were already paid for "
