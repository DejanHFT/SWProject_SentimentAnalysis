Advise on how to build this.,SecondOddd,https://i.redd.it/gr4wg09goxlb1.png,2,2,"I've assembled plenty of ikea wood furniture before but this is going to be my first significant DIY project. I want to achieve a similar diffused light effect. Could I please get advise on what materials I'd need and how I should go about building this. 

I have limited tools: hammer, nails etc , a basic wood drill. 

I can buy a soldering iron etc to connect the LEDs etc.

My initial idea was to buy basic building blocks from IKEA (like a small drawer) and  work on top of that.

I assume I can ask a CNC shop to mill the design plate for me but I really have no clue how feasible that is. 

Real noob here looking for sage advice."
