Deadlift well ahead of Squat,Buwwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/36nrzs/deadlift_well_ahead_of_squat/,10,2,"My deadlift PR which I just hit last week is 425x1. My squat PR which I just tested last night is 295x1. It seems to me there's a larger than normal gap between the two, or is it not as bad of a discrepancy as I think?"
