What are some other songs that feature this specific melody?,SewerSkeever,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/185v35y/what_are_some_other_songs_that_feature_this/,2,2,"I’ve got a lot of free time today so I’ve been sitting down and listening to “important” 2000’s albums that I’ve never listened to all the way through or even at all, and the “bum bum bum bum” drum and bass that starts around 3:20 in New York, I Love You But You’re Dragging Me Down by LCD Soundsystem is just scratching an itch I didn’t know I had, I know I’ve heard it before because it’s not super unique or anything, but I can’t think of other songs with it. Thanks everyone."
