I [24 M] have to take my father [57] off of life support today.,CaliHeatx,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6m29al/i_24_m_have_to_take_my_father_57_off_of_life/,139,1791,"I posted an earlier story about the events leading to this if you are curious.

My father has been on life support since he collapsed at 12am on 7/5/17. His heart had stopped for 8-10 minutes before he was treated. The hospital did a lot of tests to determine brain death, and yesterday they told us the bad news, that he was certainly already gone and the time of death was called. 

My family and I decided, knowing my father's wonderful giving spirit, should be an organ donor. Honestly my dad would be surprised and thrilled to know some of his organs are viable. So last night we signed the documents which prepare him for the donation process. 

Today, most likely they will take him off life support to try and recover the organs they can. I understand that he is already gone and he is basically now an empty shell/cadaver which they are preserving with advanced technology. But still, I feel it may be very difficult for me today to actually say goodbye and see him with his heart beating for the last time. Now I'm trying to figure out how to cope with this.

**tl;dr:** I'm trying to figure out the best way to cope with the finality of taking my father off of life support.

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for your kindness, I shared this post with my family and they are floored by how much advice and sympathy we've gotten. 

I felt the urge to show you all this picture of me, my dad and my brother. It is my favorite picture of us three and I will cherish it forever. http://imgur.com/a/hb6gS"
