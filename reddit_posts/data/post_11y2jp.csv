Reddit helped me avoid an affair. What real life things has Reddit helped you with?,faithful_spouse_123,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11y2jp/reddit_helped_me_avoid_an_affair_what_real_life/,764,1182,"The title says it all, but for those who like long stories, here we go:

I married young (23 she was 22), and had a kid young (25). Neither of which I regret. 

My wife and I have been through a lot together. We moved to SF knowing almost no one and I got assaulted in front of her right after she arrived and she suffered some mild PTSD (which really hampered our San Francisco experience). We got pregnant unexpectedly, and were thrown into parenthood. As soon as we started to feel settled, I got into graduate school and we packed up and headed back to the East Coast (my wife is an angel).

In a matter of months, my wife went from a teacher in San Francisco, with an active social life and a lot of friends, to a full time mother with no community or support. That fall her Uncle was diagnosed with cancer, and that winter her grandfather (who she was really close to) passed away. Naturally, that was all really tough, and throughout that year she suffered through depression. I did my best to be supportive, but was having trouble myself balancing school, fatherhood and the new location.

My wife then finally makes a good friend, let’s call her Ronnie. They hang out a lot, along with her bf. We all get along well, but Ronnie and I get along very well. Things are just comfortable and we laugh a lot together. The friendship between her and my wife continues to grow, and when Ronnie finds herself between apartments she lives with us for a month. We find we work next door to each other, and start running into each other, then taking breaks outside together. We start chatting online and texting each other. I’ve always been a hopeless romantic and loved the attention, the flirty-ness and the fun. 

While we never crossed any hard lines (expressing our feeling, kissing, etc) we were definitely on the borderline of an emotional affair. However, I was in denial and did not want to give up my friendship with Ronnie or fess up to where I was.

I am happy to report that yesterday, I finally owned up to what was happening. While it might be hard to understand this from an outside viewpoint, this was an incredibly hard move. One of the things that helped push me over the edge was reading people’s stories on reddit that had let things go too far. I knew I did not want that, and in order to guarantee that didn’t happen I needed to preemptively end my bilateral friendship with Ronnie.

Talked to my wife about it as well. She was very understanding and appreciative, though, justifiably a little hurt (“why am I not enough?”). 

**Lesson 1:** My wife is amazing, and I am an idiot.

**Lesson 2:** If you are thinking about cheating, don’t. Stop things as soon as possible. It’s like a cancer, catch it early and it is quite treatable.


**tl;dr; I almost cheated on my wife w/her best friend. Read about other’s stories, and sobered up.**
