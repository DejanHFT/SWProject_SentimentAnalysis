>Holland has built a legacy that will long linger in the Spider-Man firmament; better he should place it on the mantle now than wear out his welcome. The odds of that actually happening are, of course, slim to none.

>Spider-Man: No Way Home is exactly the movie you think it is if you've seen a single trailer for this movie for good and for ill. The first and second acts are very messy, but the third act pulls it together to pack one hell of an emotional punch.

>Very well-paced considering that it's a 2.5 hour long film. The first act served as more of a set-up for the film but act two and three take off and it's a thrill ride to the end. Filled with action and heart. Every character has their own time to shine.
