'Godzilla vs Kong' Review Thread,121jigawatts,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/md7fcc/godzilla_vs_kong_review_thread/,491,538,"[79% RT score so far](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godzilla_vs_kong) will update the post for more reviews   
**Critic consensus**: Delivering squarely on its title, Godzilla vs. Kong swats away character development and human drama to deliver all the spectacle you'd expect from giant monsters slugging it out.   



>Godzilla Vs. Kong mostly delivers on its promise of a big monster fighting another big monster. It just depends whether you're willing to sit through the toe-curlingly bad set-up that surrounds it.

>Watching these famous monsters share the screen for the first time since 1963's King Kong Vs. Godzilla, in a series of expertly choreographed battles, packs real wallop...  

-[totalfilm ](https://www.gamesradar.com/godzilla-vs-kong-review/)  
>When our own world appears to be on the edge of ruin, these monsters feel like our primal fears made incarnate...(but the movie) suffers from the same malady as so many modern blockbusters: it's immensely watchable, but instantly forgettable.

>Overall, Godzilla vs. Kong delivers exactly what it promises on the tin. It is brimming energy and enthusiasm and is a brazenly gonzo rock-em sock-em monster mash filled with satisfying visual spectacle.

>You're here for one thing: to see Godzilla and Kong fight it out until at least one city topples to the ground. Godzilla vs. Kong delivers just that, with spectacular action, colorful Tron-like neon lights and a pulsating electronic score. These flourishes set it apart from its grayer counterparts in the franchise known as the MonsterVerse, beginning with 2014's Godzilla.

>The result is a film that, while it does stick to the vs movie script a little too much, offers a fast-paced, occasionally baffling, always enjoyable beastie battle that will appeal to anyone who knows how much joy can be sparked watching a giant monkey lay the boot into an enormous, lazer-breathing lizard.

>Perhaps asking too much for a film that should’ve laid its focus on a monster battle instead of groundwork that ultimately means nothing once the two CGI titans take their swings on one another – the sequence itself is glorious in its stupidity – Godzilla vs. Kong is a B-movie (at best) through and through. Whilst I didn’t personally take to its overwroughtness, I can’t deny it’s certainly a big screen spectacle should you wish to devote your time to the most brainless of exercises. If King of the Monsters tickled you then this monstrous battle should suffice. If not, and you want your mindless action to have a little more ironic intelligence, this is one fight not worth the spectator fee.
