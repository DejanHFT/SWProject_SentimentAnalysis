I've lost 35 lbs but don't really see progress. Anyone up for giving motivation? [Pics],askthepoolboy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ua90r/ive_lost_35_lbs_but_dont_really_see_progress/,63,9,"In the last three years, I went from 199 lbs to 260 lbs. Poor eating choices, and zero exercise got me there, and I decide to get back on track a few months ago. I'm now dow to 225 lbs, but stuck in a plateau. I've been here before, so I know it's just a matter of time, but I was looking through my ""Before"" pics, and comparing them with my current pics, and I'm just not seeing much progress. Could be that I see myself daily. Any motivation to help me through this plateau would be appreciated (or tips to break through it).

EDIT:
Was suggested I post my routine...so here it is:

Mondays: Shoulders and Triceps, Abs, followed by running or a cross-training machine for 1 hour
Tuesdays: 1 hour Cardio
Wednesdays: Chest and Back, Abs, followed by running or a cross-training machine for 1 hour
Thursdays: 1 hour Cardio - usually intervals
Friday: Legs and Biceps, Abs, followed by running or a cross-training machine for 1 hour
Saturday: 10 - 10 second sprints with 50 seconds rest

DIET:
Breakfast: Protein shake or english muffin with egg and canadian bacon
snack: greek yogurt with blueberries or an apple and handful of almonds
lunch: turkey or chicken sandwich on whole wheat with spinach and tomato. I use light sour cream instead of mayo.
snack: low-fat cheese stick and V8
dinner: usually grilled chicken, fish or pork chops, brown rice with black beans, and another vegetable
snack: small protein shake"
