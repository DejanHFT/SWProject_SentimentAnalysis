What city in SW Germany should I explore during my free day?,wondorous,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/12t8exs/what_city_in_sw_germany_should_i_explore_during/,7,3,"I'm going to Freiburg, Germany for a wedding in early May. I have a rental car and a free day before the wedding. Where should I go? I'm flying into Frankfurt and have about 24h, so max that I'd want to drive is \~3 hours away. My ideas so far were to stick around and explore Freiburg or drive to Luxembourg. I've already been to Frankfurt and Heidelberg.

Any favorites out there or hidden gems that warrant a day of exploration?"
