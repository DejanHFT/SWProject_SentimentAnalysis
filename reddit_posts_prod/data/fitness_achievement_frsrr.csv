Tomorrow is Today! [Start Here](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dHlybF9sMWpYV01sbkFib1BQYnVVVVE6MQ&theme=0AX42CRMsmRFbUy1iODQwMzFlYi1iZjJhLTRmNmUtODQ0My1iNjJmYTUzNjQ2ZWE&ifq)**


About half a year ago a guy came here and pumped a lot of us for setting a 90 day goal and about 1500 of us joined /r/90days. Unfortunately that fell through, but that is not the end of the story. Quite a few of us decided that he was not the only one that could push us towards the goal, we could do it by sticking together. We started [/r/90daysgoal](/r/90daysgoal) and so far we have gone through two rounds now.


In last round of 90 days we achieved a good amount of goals. We've had 22 people check in, with a total of 284 lbs (129 kg) lost. 9 people reported their body fat percentage, for a total of 32% lost. For goals that were not fully achieved we are going to start again. We are warming up for round three now (Kicking off from Monday) and if you want to be part of this, now is the time to get up and put an effort into round three.

We need people who can join in and help each other, if you are kind of person who knows a bit of stuff then it would greatly help us. If you are able to share motivational stories/links and video then we need you as well.


Challenge the (wo)man inside you, the one that is fit and energetic. The one you keep on putting to sleep with a constant supply of sugar. The one you keep telling you will do it tomorrow. Challenge yourself that the fitter you is the real you and you can do it. Tomorrow is NOW.


Let's get ready and hope that next Monday you will be a different person, a more energetic, fit and goal oriented person. Let's get off our asses and DO IT. Let's make tomorrow happen.

**I LOVE REDDIT **

>An anonymous redditor just sent you 3 months of reddit gold! Wasn't that nice?
>You're doing a great job on 90DayGoal! Keep it up and I'm excited to see the improvements!

This is why I love reddit, thank you whoever you are, but I believe other mods deserve it more than me.

**How does it Work?**

Once you sign up with your details and goals and join /r/90daysgoal we have a team of mods who post frequently. The posts are made up of encouragement, motivation, updates and healthy tips. After each week everyone will be encouraged to check in their weight in similar short form. You can check in your weight only or you have the option of checking in more. e.g. Body measurements, Exercise / calories. Our team of the mods have access to the data and we are planning to PM members that are falling behind. Member are encouraged to share daily stories of something good or bad they did to get support from others.

**NEW ADDITION**

One of our mod suggested that mods will send PMs to people who are falling behind, I have added the option where you can chose not to get reminder PMs. If anybody who signed up before does not want these reminders then please let us know.
