It's a very simple bread pudding that is made with a sweetened milk mixture, and generous servings of clotted cream. Unlike most bread puddings, this is instead made with pastry and once baked, it is topped with all manner of nuts, sultanas, and even coconut. [Om Ali](https://imgur.com/a/xMe31aM) is truly a regal dessert in texture, flavour and potentially origins, and it's definitely something you should try out.

## What is Om Ali
The simplest way to describe Om Ali, is a bread pudding that uses pastry instead of bread. This is traditionally made with [Goulash](https://turkishstylecooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/gullac_yapragi2.jpg) (A pastry similar to filo, not the dish I covered last week) pastry sheets, which are baked and then soaked with sweetened milk. The benefit of using pastry, is that it will absorb some of the sweetened milk without developing a soggy and mushy texture like bread does. Personally I forego the Goulash pastry, and instead make this with either Croissants or Palmiers, which I toast before soaking in the milk. I find that the puff pastry used in those goods ends up with a very similar texture to the Goulash, while the crispy-ness of it, helps to give the pudding structural integrity. When the pastry has been soaked, it's added to an oven proof baking dish then topped with a healthy amount of clotted cream. Before it goes under a broiler, it's sprinkled with sugar and then allowed to caramelize and form a crystalline skin on top. Once it comes out of the oven, it's topped with your chosen toppings then served while steaming hot.

It's an extremely simple recipe, that is easily customised by the toppings added to it. It's common to add lots of nuts to the dish, such as hazelnuts, flaked almonds and pistachios, which provide the pudding with a crunchy contrast to the soft texture. Adding sultanas or raisins is also common, and they provide a squishy texture with bursts of fruity sweetness. You'll commonly encounter Om Ali at weddings and parties in Egypt, as it's a common buffet food and easy to make in large quantities. My mother in law likes to make it for family feasts when we have a large number of guests, but in my household we make it when we are having a Middle Eastern themed dinner. Despite it's easy recipe, a lot of people purchase Om Ali from a local dairy store, these are just like green grocers, except they sell everything related to dairy (Cheese, Yoghurt, Milk, Cream, Puddings, Butter). Another common place people get Om Ali, is from pudding shops. There's a number of chains operating throughout Egypt, that you can pull your car up to and get a drive through Om Ali, or Rice Pudding (My kind of drive through). 

## Cultural Context

The theory goes that Om Ali which means mother of Ali, is named after one of [Sultan Izz al-Din Aybak's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aybak) wifes who had a son called Ali. Izz al-Din Aybak, was the first sultan of the Mamluk Sultanate (1250-1517). When the Ayubbid dynasty (Saladin's Dynasty) fell in 1250, [Shajarat al Durr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shajar_al-Durr) became the first Sultana (Female Sultan, not the fruit) to rule Egypt. The Syrian Emirs refused to pay homage to her, and so Izz al-Din Aybak married her and was installed as Sultan. Some time later a conflict between them arose, and in the fashion of sultans, Shajarat al Durr had the sultan assassinated in his bath by his servants. She was arrested and then beaten to death by the servants of Al-Mansur Ali (One of Izz al-Din Aybak's sons) and his mother (she's Om Ali). The pudding gets it's name from Al-Mansur Ali and his mother, who it's said, ordered the palace chefs to make a pudding to celebrate the new Sultan and had it distributed to the public. 

Despite it's supposed regal origins, Om Ali is very much a dessert of the people. It's quite cheap to make, and it's common for the nuts to be replaced with cheaper varieties such as peanuts to save on costs. Egyptians have a strong sweet tooth and winters get quite cold, so the popularity of a hot pudding is no surprise. Of course modern twists on Om ALi are made, I've seen some with cocoa flavored milk, and you can even get Om Ali with ice cream for a hot and cold mix..


## Flavor Profile
A spoon full of Om Ali, will have a number of different textures on it. First there will be the crispy texture from the top layer of pastry, this is usually coated in a thin layer of sugar which adds a crunchy sugar texture similar to creme brule. Then you'll have softened pastry, which will have absorbed some of the milk, but will still retain it's shape and will not be soggy. You'll also have some of the sweetened milk mixture on your spoon, which if you use a high quality milk, will have a creamy and silky texture. Then there's the crunchy textures you get from the nuts, and the squidgy textures from the sultanas. Together it's a wonderful mouthful of alternating textures.

In terms of flavour, the milk is supposed to have a creamy buttery flavour, while being quite sweet. My recipe is not as sweet as others I've tried, and it uses brown sugar as well as white sugar for some caramel notes. Most of the flavour you get will come from the nuts or sultanas you choose to use. Hazelnuts and flaked almonds are the classic choice though you can also use pistachios instead.

## Ingredients 

### Om Ali (Makes 4 large portions or 1 family size serving):
* 450g (16 oz) Croissants or 400g Palmiers (Bakery croissants will probably be denser than grocery store croissants, so you may need 600g)  
* 1L (33 fl oz) Whole Milk (High Quality, preferably jersey cow or buffalo)  
* 250ml (8.5 fl oz) Extra thick cream or clotted cream (High quality, preferably jersey cow or buffalo). You can also add cream to regular milk for a similar texture  
* 75g (2.7 oz) Brown sugar + extra for dusting  
* 75g (2.7 oz) White sugar  

### Toppings:
* 50g (1.8 oz) Hazelnuts  
* 50g (1.8 oz) Almond flakes  
* 50g (1.8 oz) Sultanas  
* 25g (0.9 oz) Dessicated Coconut  
You can use any nuts or other fillings you like  

## Directions

### To prepare the croissants:
1. Using a bread knife slice the corners (ears) off of each end of your croissants
2. Slice the body of the croissant in half and then slice it into bite sized chunks
3. Line a baking sheet with grease proof paper, and place your croissant pieces on it in a single layer. Turn them so the inner part of the croissant is facing up
4. Place the sheet in the oven to bake at 180c (350f) for about 6 minutes, until all the croissant pieces have browned and dried slightly
5. Repeat until you have done all the croissants

### To prepare the nuts:
1. Peel your hazelnuts and remove any of the brown skin
2. Using a knife chop the nuts into large chunks
3. Place the nuts on a  baking sheet lined with grease proof paper and bake at 180c (350f) until toasted
4. Remove immediately from the tray and allow to cool

### To prepare the milk mixture:
1. Add the milk to a large pot on high heat
2. Add in both the brown sugar and white sugar, and stir the pot, allow to come to a boil
3. Once it boils and foams up, remove it from the heat and use immediately

### To assemble the Om Ali:
1. In an oven proof baking dish, place your baked croissant pieces. I prefer doing individual servings.
2. Add any toppings you want to include over the top of the croissant pieces
3. Add enough milk so the pastry is just barely emerging from it. You can add more croissant pieces if necessary to get it to the right depth
4. Spoon over as much of the cream as you can and then top with some more brown sugar
5. Set your broiler to low and place the puddings beneath it
6. Once the cream has melted and the surface of the Om Ali has caramelized, remove it from the oven
7. Garnish with more nuts and serve once it is no longer a scalding temperature"
