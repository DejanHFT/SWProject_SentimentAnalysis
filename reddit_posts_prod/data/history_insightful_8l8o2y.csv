How quickly were the Romans able to fortify their camps while on campaign? I am thinking specificly about during The Gallic Wars.,JDamrom,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/8l8o2y/how_quickly_were_the_romans_able_to_fortify_their/,92,431,"Reading Julius Ceasars Gallic Wars I was struck again and again by how sophisticated their camps were while on campaign.  Sophisticated meaning the way they are describe they encompassed a huge area and had a standard layout of broad roads,  in addition to this there are descriptions of the walls, ditches, some times towers...  I suppose the descriptions of towers might have been more associate with actions like the siege of Alesia?

The scale of some of the encampments makes sense when hunkering down for winter but its hard to imagine as a ""temporary"" facility that would be used for only a couple nights respite.

Are there any sources that give insight to what sort of criteria went into how much effort they would put into their encampments based upon the anticipated duration of stay?  

Do we have insights into what an encampment looked like when they were enroute to a destination and marching 20 miles a day versus stopped for a week versus a month or more?

An extension of this is that it seems unlikely that they would leave a fortified encampment behind for an enemy (especially when a Roman camp might exceed the design and standards of construction that an enemy has ever built for themselves).

  Do we know how much effort they would expend to deconstruct an encampment that they did not plan to return to?  

I ask because logically the more complex an encampment the greater labor investment to both build it and dismantle it.  If the army is marching it seems unlikely that you would leave a bunch of men behind for days (a week?) to destroy a temporary fort.  But maybe in the context of a campaign that works since you have a rear gaurd and might take a long time to get the baggage train and the logistic resources moving anyway?

Lots of quesrions i kno a  but the logistics of moving an army in any time period are fascinating and mind boggling to me.   If this  information is embedded in The Gallic Wars I would appreciate having it pointed out cause I clearly missed it!"
