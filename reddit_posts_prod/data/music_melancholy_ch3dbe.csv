God knows... Kadokawa - Aya Hirano (''The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya''),bshawty,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/ch3dbe/god_knows_kadokawa_aya_hirano_the_melancholy_of/,0,3," [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWB01IuMvzA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWB01IuMvzA) 

Recently, Kyoto Animation was hit with a devastating terrorist attack at one of its studios in Kyoto, Japan. Countless lives and families have been ruined as a result of the attack.

Some of you may know this song as the hit coming from Kyoto Animation's masterpiece, the ''The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.""

Whether you like anime or not, I'd like to share the back story from this music video. In the mid-2000s, little anime had reached the United States other than typical shounen (Naruto, etc.) or mecha (Gundam). Haruhi changed that. It has been identified time and time again as one of the most influential anime ever made, ranking next to Dragonball and many of the other legendary works of the genre. The entire show led up to this talent show, and the studio provided an exemplary execution of its quality in the form of arguably the best anime music video ever made.

If you would like to view more of Kyoto Animation's works, I'd recommend ""A Silent Voice,"" ""Violet Evergarden,"" or ""Clannad."" Each is a masterpiece in it's own way."
