Help me get into turn-based strategy games,musicvvins,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/yapsoe/help_me_get_into_turnbased_strategy_games/,14,3,"I love all sorts of games and I love board games. I’ve played Mario Rabbids and enjoy that, but I don’t find myself going back to it the way I do with other games. 

I see so many great looking turn-based strategy games - cool lore, beautiful artwork, enthusiastic community. For some reason, the turn-based thing hasn’t landed for me yet. I’m not quite sure why either. 

I’m ok with this style not being my thing, but I’d like to explore it and give it a real shot. So, advice? Ideas to shift my perspective? Games to try? 

I have an Xbox and a Switch. I can also do Steam but don’t very often. 

Thanks!"
