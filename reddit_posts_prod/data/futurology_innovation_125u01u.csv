"if AI replaces middle class jobs, buyers may not have money to purchase products, and the economy & innovation will decline, is this suicide?",MaceKiller,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/125u01u/if_ai_replaces_middle_class_jobs_buyers_may_not/,1128,1060," Capitalism is all about the free market, which means the level of  innovation depends on demand and supply. And when there's high demand,  companies get into fierce competition with each other, which is why we  get new and improved products like the iPhone every year. But it's  important to note that the middle class makes up the majority of buyers  in this system. So, if AI takes over middle class jobs, these buyers  won't have the same purchasing power, and that could cause a drop in  innovation and profits for big companies ."
