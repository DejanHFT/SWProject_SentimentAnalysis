"Wolf of Wall Street isn't a critique of Wall Street. It's a critique of you, the viewer",spaceythrowaway,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/35iyda/wolf_of_wall_street_isnt_a_critique_of_wall/,1327,7446,"Every time I watch Wolf of Wall Street, I want to be more like Jordan Belfort.

I know this is a critique leveled by so many people: that for a anti-Wall Street movie, it sure does glamorize Jordan's life a lot.

I mean, the guy's partying, having sex with the hottest women, and he doesn't even get a half decent sentence. What's so bad about that?

Critics complain that we never get a shot of his victims. We never see anyone who has lost his job or his life earnings because of Jordan's schemes. The only people it touches upon are Jordan and his immediate family, and we never even see a glimpse of what happens to his first wife, his dad or his mom.

Then we get this scene at the very end:

Take a look at their faces. What do you see? Hope? Greed? Awe?

That's exactly the same look I had on my face watching Jordan. Not disdain. Not disgust. But awe.

I wanted to *be* Jordan. I wanted that Alpha Male ""Masters of the Universe"". I wanted a big mansion and a hot wife.

Exactly the same dreams all those people in the last shot want.

This is Martin Scorsese's real critique: Wall Street is just a symptom. The real problem is with us, the ordinary people who want to emulate Jordan instead of rejecting him.

I think that last shot captured the essence of the movie. That we will overlook all outrageous behavior as long as we get a chance to make big money. 

This, to me, is the essence of Scorsese's critique."
