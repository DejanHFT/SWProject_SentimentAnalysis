What inspired you to write the current story you've wrote or are writing?,KolarWolfDogBear,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/16qn6ij/what_inspired_you_to_write_the_current_story/,505,124,"Mines is the political cartoon called ""School Begins"". Anyone who doesn't know, it features Uncle Sam ""teaching"" four kids about how to be American. The four kids are Philippines, Hawaii, Cuba, and Puerto Rico.

My story originally was about how a kid joined a group of Antiheroes who protect their marginalized communities.

Now...it's the same thing, but for my eventual ""Big Four"" they will be a representation of those four kids and how they protect their communities and all marginalized people from anyone who tries to hurt them.

One character is Puerto Rican
Another is Puerto Rican/Cuban
Another is Filipina
And the 4th is Native Hawaiian (she's mixed)

It's not gonna be a political book but it's a symbolize or analogy or something like that to that picture and how they're not just weak kids but strong people (shapeshifters in fact)

Edit: To anyone wondering my other inspirations are Narnia + Animorphs + Marvel + DC + DBZ + One Piece + True Blood + Urban Animal + Dresden Files + Animosity + Star Wars (any alien series) + my own crazy mind"
