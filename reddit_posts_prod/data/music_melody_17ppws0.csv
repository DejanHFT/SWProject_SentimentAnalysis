Which popular song has an amazing presence of drums?,TerjiD,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/17ppws0/which_popular_song_has_an_amazing_presence_of/,997,429,"I will never get my hands down over Avenged Sevenfold's album Nightmare.

But to answer my own question, ""I'm Alive"" by Celine Dion has such a cool drumbeat that just won't be ignored. 

I just love how it continues, almost monotonously, throughout the song, while grabbing its deserved attention as the fundament of the melody."
