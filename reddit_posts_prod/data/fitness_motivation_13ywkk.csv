The Perfect Motivation,Kettyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/13ywkk/the_perfect_motivation/,20,70,"I have been running seriously for a few months (since seeing my little brother train for and complete a marathon), but found myself struggling to motivate myself to go running every day.

Until something awesome happened. A few weeks ago, I was texting my girlfriend and found a three-day old text that said, ""Just went for a run. Can't stop panting. Feel amazing.""

This sparked an idea that has proven to be a foolproof method to motivate myself...

**After every run, I log my thoughts and feelings at the time.** I save these thoughts and have begun making desktop backgrounds that cycle through every few seconds, so I see them all the time. Reading these makes me feel incredible. Along with sharing this method, I'd like to share with you all some of my recent entries. Again, all of these were recorded within one minute of completing my run. Now, I do it as soon as I get a drink of water.


*After running my first full mile, non-stop*

""I feel like running ten more miles""

*After a bad day*

""I forgot what I was stressed about""

*After running twelve minutes nonstop for the first time*

""If I can do this, what else can I do?""

*After running 1.5 miles nonstop for the first time*

""I am better than I was yesterday.""

*After my first full week without skipping a workout*

""Any improvement, big or small, is worth being proud of""

*One hour ago, after my longest run of my life*

""I now have empirical evidence that my hard work is paying off.""

**You are your biggest motivator. Go out there and kick some ass!**"
