Computer's at the Speed of Light,xTachibana,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/19kr9n/computers_at_the_speed_of_light/,7,0,"Say you were on a Spaceship, and you were to travel at the speed of light (not 99.99999~% of it, but the whole speed of light), from what I've heard, anyone travelling at that speed would feel as if time didnt move at all (basically as if time had stopped), but would computers function, say like an AI that controls your ship while you're travelling at light speed?

another thing, since you're time is basically stopped, how would you be able to stop your ship by the time you get to your destination?"
