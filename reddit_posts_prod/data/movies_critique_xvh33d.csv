Film criticisms you've never understood,Flat_Fox_7318,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/xvh33d/film_criticisms_youve_never_understood/,84,9,"Usually when I read reviews, I typically understand where the critics are coming from even if I don't necessarily agree. However, there are some cases where I don't see what the big deal is or was.  

For example, the common critique behind **Halloween II ('81)** is its cheap, grisly and gratuitous violence compared to its predecessor. Yes, the film is bloodier and more explicitly violent than the original, but it's fairly tame even by standards at the time. Slashers like **Friday the 13th Part 2**, **My Bloody Valentine**, **The Burning** and **The Prowler** (all of which came out in '81) are far more graphically violent. I've never grasped why this film got that wrap and still continues to in some circles. 

Are there any films you guys feel similarly about?"
