"Me [29/F] with my family [31-55 M/F], not supportive of me wanting to adopt foster children",Vapinginthebathroom,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9y3mqk/me_29f_with_my_family_3155_mf_not_supportive_of/,24,78,"I recently turned 29 and am at a pretty good place in my life (decent career, no debt, savings, etc.). I currently do not have a significant other and haven’t been having good luck finding a serious partner in the past two years since my last relationship ended. 


I’ve always known I wanted to adopt children, ideally from foster care (older kids).  Even though I’m single I’ve started looking into doing foster-to-adopt through my local county and it seems completely feasible. The problem is my entire family is completely against it. 


My three siblings [M/F 31-35], my Mom [55], step-Dad [54], step sisters [27 and 25], and biological Dad [55] all said they think it’s a bad idea and they do not support me. My step brother [31] and his wife said they think it’s great to adopt older kids and told me to go for it. I’m really shocked by everyone else’s reactions and have no idea what to do from here.


I was raised to accept and treat my step siblings as my biological ones, but my whole family is basically saying they won’t accept “strangers” into their lives. My dad said the kids would be mentally disturbed (so are some of my siblings though!). My mom said I won’t bond with older kids, etc. My sister said it’s “stupid” to intentionally be a single parent. 


It’s not like I just sprung this on them. I’ve always voiced my interest in adopting/fostering, but now that I’ve been actively looking into it there’s been a very negative response. It’s frustrating because I always am supportive of my relatives and expected their full support on this.


Should I just give them all some time to process everything? I am totally prepared to raise kids on my own, but always pictured my whole family being involved (like they are with my nieces and nephews). The last thing I want is to foster kids and have my family treat them poorly. I’ve always been close to my family and am trying to figure out if I need to distance myself from them. 




TLDR: Family does not want me fostering/adopting kids "
