Wanting Help Analyzing and Critiquing Movies...,ibanezjerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3g5bl4/wanting_help_analyzing_and_critiquing_movies/,1,1,"I'm looking for a 101 / amateur lesson on critiquing movies. I can enjoy almost any movie as long as they are the right genre. Sure, you might want to compare this gift to the movie *Shallow Hal*, but I really want to be able to articulate my thoughts on a movie to others.

I don't know where to start, but here are some things that I think would help the discussion...
---------------------
**Contrasting** - I thought it may be worth contrasting movies that do / don't do something particularly well. Here are some examples:

* Directing
* Writing
* Cinematography
* Acting
* Story
* Character Development
* etc.

I think it would be better to have the ""bad"" example be a relatively good movie otherwise unless the deficiency is easy to pick out among the other defects.

**Points of Analysis** - I listed some above, but what else helps make a movie ""good""?

**Best Traits of a Highly Praised Film** - What's a good and/or well-known movie? Why is it good? What's the best thing the movie has going for it?

I know there's a huge element of subjectivity, but I don't think it would be a waste of time to talk about it.

I've recently been going back a decade (or two or three) to watch movies I missed because of the ""No Rated R Movies"" policy (don't worry, I've seen a lot in my time). Over the past few months I've watched movies like *Shawshank Redemption, The Departed, Schindler's List, Alien(s),* as well as some more recent ones like *Mad Max - Fury Road*.

I enjoy some pretty shitty movies... like *Mario Brothers* and *Dragon Ball Evolution*."
