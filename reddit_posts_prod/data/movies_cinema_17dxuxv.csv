a moment in your life that showed you the power of cinema,greppoboy,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/17dxuxv/a_moment_in_your_life_that_showed_you_the_power/,129,133,"yesterday i was at my local bar, that me and my friends take care of, something that we in italy call ""circolino"", my friends there are people who only watch netflix series and action blockbusters at best, not all of them but must of them.

But then Django comes in tv, most of them had never even seen it and didn't know what it was about, but that movie did something magical, slowly, people gathered around the screen, in silence, staring, everyone got more and more invested, until there were around 20 people staring at the screen during the skull scene.

But the best moment was when django wins at the end, and the music from ""they called him trinity"" started, and EVERYONE recognized it from the Bud and Terence movie, and they all cheered, then talked for like an hour about the film and wanted to see more of it.

I had tears in my eyes i must admit, even if no one saw it, they were so happy, so was i.

Did something like this ever happened to you?"
