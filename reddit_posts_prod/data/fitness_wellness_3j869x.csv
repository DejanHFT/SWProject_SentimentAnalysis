"Well if Alcohol calories are ""empty"" calories... Where do they go? How do those calories stack-up with your TDEE?",tectactoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3j869x/well_if_alcohol_calories_are_empty_calories_where/,140,200,"Let's say you know you have a TDEE of 2500 kcal. Here are some situations I've been curious about as far as HOW alcohol affects the outcome:

**Scenario 1:**

> Let's say you're trying to maintain. You eat 2500 calories worth of food VERSUS 2000 calories worth of food and 500 calories of alcohol.

**Scenario 2:**

> Now let's say you're trying to bulk while lifting heavy. You eat 3000 calories worth of food VERSUS 2500 calories worth of food and 500 calories of alcohol.

**Scenario 3:** 

>Finally, assume you're cutting while moderately lifting. You eat 2000 calories worth of food VERSUS 1500 calories worth of food and 500 calories of alcohol.

In each case, assume the consumption is constant for weeks/months, and the person maintains a consistent lifting schedule during those periods. How does each situation differ when alcohol is/isn't involved in the equation?

**EDIT:** I'm also meaning, slightly more in-depth than just weight loss, but for example in the bulking scenario, does muscle composition suffer when alcohol is involved? During a cut, is muscle retention hampered? Any body composition effects during a time of maintenance??"
