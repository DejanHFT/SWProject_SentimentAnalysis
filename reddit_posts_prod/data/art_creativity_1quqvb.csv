Creativity [discussion/question],podoka,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/1quqvb/creativity_discussionquestion/,3,1,"Hello, I need advice. 

I love to draw but I lack creativity. Whenever I attempt to draw I just get to a blank and do a stupid head shot or bust shot. Even then, it lacks in : ideas, emotion, flow, ect.

I see artists like [OMO-CAT](www.omocat-blog.com) & [Kaneoya Sachiko](http://yoiko-yokochou.com/yoiko_top.html) and I wonder how they come up with ideas when drawing. I'm envious and jealous of both of them. I wish I could do that. Drawing is becoming such a drag to me because I can't do anything with it.

Is there anything I can do to make my mind a bit more creative? Tips? Suggestions? 

I'd also like to see a bit of a discussion too. I love hearing how other people draw inspiration. (Btw ; I have many images from my artistic idols. So I'm set on the inspiration part for now.. I think.)

ps: I read the rules but if this does not fit in this section, I'm sorry, please inform me where it'd be more suitable, thanks."
