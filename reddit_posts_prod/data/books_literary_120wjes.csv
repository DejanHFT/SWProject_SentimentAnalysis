"Did the ""literary movement"" end?",Soitslikedat,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/120wjes/did_the_literary_movement_end/,14,4,"Provocative title, I know, but I don't think there is a better way to phrase it. Ever since the end of the 1960s, I feel like we ended up with no actual movements to talk about in literature. 

I don't know about other mediums besides cinema (which had many movements and scenes leading up to the 2000s) and music (which had a few remarkable ones since the 90s, notably and recently the Hyperpop style), but I feel that literature especially hasn't had a real collective of people working within similar premises and interacting with each other's works, writing manifestoes and all that.

 In my country (Brazil), for example, the last movement I have any news of is Concretismo, in which two of the three names associated with its inception already passed. 

Has the idea of a literary movement fizzled out? If so, how did that happen, and is it better that way? If not, why is it not taking off, popularity-wise, if we're more connected than ever, and what is (or should be) our framework in understanding them?"
