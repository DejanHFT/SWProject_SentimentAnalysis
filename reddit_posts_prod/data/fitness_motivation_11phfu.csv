How can I become more motivated?,Coastward,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/11phfu/how_can_i_become_more_motivated/,56,10,"For about 6 months, I've been trying to lose weight so that my Type 2 Diabetes doesn't get out of hand. I would start working out pretty well for a week, but then I'd stop working out for the same amount of time. I just can't get myself to stick to a workout plan. Any help would be great."
