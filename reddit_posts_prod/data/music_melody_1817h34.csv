What’s a song with no (or almost no) vocals that makes you feel EXACTLY what the title depicts,_Shreg_,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1817h34/whats_a_song_with_no_or_almost_no_vocals_that/,1063,841,"For me it’s:

[Supervillain Theme - Madvillain](https://open.spotify.com/track/2m10twwgw9NxzvlQkwCOIO?si=YwKK4bsUT4KmKhyHDdTafg)

The melody is kinda basic and the song isn’t that long but it encapsulates the eerie feeling it was going for so well"
