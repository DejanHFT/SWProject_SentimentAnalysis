More time in Mexico City or explore the Yucatan?,hgex,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16ny1kz/more_time_in_mexico_city_or_explore_the_yucatan/,3,4,"My partner and I are heading to Mexico and Cuba this December/January for 5 weeks, travelling via Santiago, Chile. 

At the moment our itinerary is:

28 Dec - Arrive in Mexico City, 4 nights
1 Jan - Depart DF for San Pancho, Nayarit for 6 nights chilling at the beach.
7 Jan - Fly to Havana. Spend 2 - 2.5 weeks exploring Cuba. Keeping this part of the itinerary flexible.

I'm trying to decide what to do for our final week before we depart Mexico City on the 29th Jan.

Options are:

1. Fly to Cancun, rent a car and spend a week exploring the Yucatan/Quintana Roo.

2. Fly back to DF and spend a few more days there (we only have 3 full days between Christmas and New Year), maybe adding a visit to Pueba.

3. Split the week between DF and Quintana Roo.

4. Extra time in Cuba/a combination on the above.

I've been to Mexico before but not to the Yucutan or Cuba and it's my partner's first visit.

We're into all sorts of things, outdoors, great food, history/art/museums and chilling at the beach. Not so much into partying. This is our summer holiday so we don't want to go home exhausted, we need some time relaxing too.

What would you do?"
