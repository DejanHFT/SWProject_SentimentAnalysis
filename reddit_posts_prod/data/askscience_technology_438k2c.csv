Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, would be baffled if he saw your cell phone but Thomas Edison could work today’s electrical grid. What happened? One industry has changed dramatically and the other hasn’t.

We launched JCESR in 2012 with a bold vision; we wanted to create game-changing battery technologies to transform transportation and the electricity grid the way lithium-ion batteries transformed personal electronics. This bold vision addresses pressing national needs to reduce carbon emissions, increase energy efficiency, lower our dependence on foreign oil, accelerate deployment of renewable solar and wind electricity on the grid and modernize the grid with new operating concepts that strengthen its flexibility, reliability and resilience.

For the past three years, we have been pursuing three energy storage concepts: “multivalent intercalation,” replacing singly charged lithium ions with doubly or triply charged working ions; “chemical transformation,” storing energy in chemical bonds; and “redox flow,” storing energy in liquid electrodes. In the next two years, these exciting research directions for science and prototypes will take shape and mature.

A Fellow of the American Physical Society and a Member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, I have published more than 400 papers in leading scientific journals and collected more than 15,000 career citations. I have led Department of Energy (DOE) workshops on hydrogen, solar energy, co-chaired the Undersecretary of Energy’s assessment of DOE’s applied energy programs and testified before the U.S. Congress on meeting sustainable energy challenges.

I will be back at 2:00 pm EST (11 am PST, 7 pm UTC) to answer you questions.

Thank you all so much! I really enjoyed this time with all of you. I have to go now, but I will be back on Monday to answer more of your questions. You are well-informed and I want you to continue to be curious and follow our progress at creating top-notch tools for next generation science and partnerships at http://www.jcesr.org/. "
