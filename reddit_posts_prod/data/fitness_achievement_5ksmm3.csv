Advice to achieve my goals.,iheartsquats14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5ksmm3/advice_to_achieve_my_goals/,3,2,So I retested my BS max (420#) and my DL max (405#) this week. I am 33yo 5'10 180#. My goal for the upcoming year is to push both of them to at least 500. My question is what advice or programming do you think would work best to achieve this? I currently train legs twice a week and deadlift once a week. Thanks!
