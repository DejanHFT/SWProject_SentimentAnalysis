"Where did the American 'Anglo-Saxon' identity come from? Considering the term in England is entirely historical and not representative of any particular population, its odd that Americans would choose to identify with this particular historical group",Mission_Busy,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/njj105/where_did_the_american_anglosaxon_identity_come/,462,630,"As a brit i've always been confused with some americans identifying as Anglo-Saxon.. How exactly are they Anglo Saxon? considering Anglo Saxons are not really a racial group at all in the UK

how can one claim 'anglo saxon' heritage?

British people are mix of all their invaders

Celtic, roman, Germanic, Viking, Norman 

it seems odd that they would focus on this singular group of Germanic settlers"
