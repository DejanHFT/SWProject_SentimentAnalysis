My bad! I was too busy with work, studies, and basically being in the same room for weeks at a time, as are so many of you. 

Here now it is time to celebrate the best posts of 2020. Content that was nominated in the voting threads will be listed first in the order of votes they received in each category. After that, you'll find content that was curated by me to fill up to [25 awards we got from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2020/comments/keeemv/its_time_to_kick_off_the_best_of_awards_for_2020/) to hand out. Each winner gets the exclusive Owl of Minerva award which grants a month of Reddit premium.

**Best Comments**

Naturally, given the raw number of comments r/philosophy gets, this category will be overlooking plenty worthy comments. Nevertheless, here's some absolutely great ones that deserve recognition:

* Sometimes, a great comment points out problems with a submissions. Here, u/lightfive is talking about [how contemporary philosophy is doing](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/kh04f6/understanding_where_philosophy_stands_in_the/gglgvmh/)
* Other times, philosophy needs practical experience. u/dragonswim, in a contentious discussion on taking women's pain seriously, [gave us a dose of medical experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/hgt0el/the_hysteria_accusation_taking_womens_pain/fw8djxl/)
* Or they explain something from science. Here, u/tredlock talks [about misunderstandings of quantum physics](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fq21z6/random_phenomena_may_exist_in_the_universe/flotx5n/).
* Great comments sometimes simply explain ideas. u/ajmarriott in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/g4bmj9/why_we_are_living_inside_a_simulation_and_why_we/fpr1w1v/) explains a rather complicated argument using probabilities

**People who keep this sub running award**

This is a special category which I unilaterally introduce because the winner does deserve recognition

You may not see this, but there are days where content creators post lots of things, and silent days where almost nothing is posted. ADD, however, is reliably posting hihg-quality blogs, papers and podcasts to make sure y'all get your daily dose of philosophy!
