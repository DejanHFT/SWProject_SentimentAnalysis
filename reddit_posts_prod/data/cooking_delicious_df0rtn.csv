Would it be gross or delicious to use flavored chips as chicken tender coating?,Trotski7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/df0rtn/would_it_be_gross_or_delicious_to_use_flavored/,205,439,"I keep having this thought in my head that  crushing up some takis or like some doritos would make a good, if very unhealthy, chicken tender. The red fuego takis or the purple Doritos bag.

Idk, I just think it would be pretty tasty. Good idea or bad idea? If bad idea, how could I go about making that kind of sweet and spicy with hint of lime fried chicken?"
