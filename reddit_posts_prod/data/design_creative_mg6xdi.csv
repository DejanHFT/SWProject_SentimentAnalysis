How to land a job at a creative agency?,xxxsadboys,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/mg6xdi/how_to_land_a_job_at_a_creative_agency/,1,3,"
Hi there everyone! I’m a mostly self taught graphic designer. I’ve done a couple online courses and I’ve also gotten a certificate in social media management. My goals are to work for a creative agency that focuses on music, but honestly any creative agency would be a great start. What do you recommend I have in my portfolio? How would I even begin my search for a job like this? Any tips would be greatly appreciated, thanks!"
