literary character face-off,scrjim,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/198t1h3/literary_character_faceoff/,1,6,"I am currently re-reading American Tabloid by James Elroy.  I think it's by far his best book; it's visceral, amoral and it tells the story of the Bay of Pigs, and Kennedy's election and assassination in an original (and gonzo) way.

At the same time I caught some of Jack Reacher on Amazon Prime - I had read one of those books in an airport about a decade ago (not really my thing).     

I was struck by how similar Big Pete Bondurant, the Shakedown King is to Jack Reacher.   Both about 6'5 and unusually violent and strong.    Not sure who was created first.   But I couldn't help wondering what would happen if these 2 fictional characters met each other; Big Pete has a moral compass but it's very flexible, so Reacher would be on the side of righteousness.  The fight would have to be inconclusive because they're both like a mirror image of each other physically, despite Big Pete's smoking and drinking habits.

Anyway, apologies for such an inane post."
