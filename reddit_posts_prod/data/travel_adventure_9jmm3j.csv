"Seeking adventure, tips?",jooneriks,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/9jmm3j/seeking_adventure_tips/,29,4,"Hello, travelers! I am currently seeking some sort of an adventure. At the moment I'm having a gap year between finishing high school and starting college/university. I am a 19 year old boy from Norway, with little to no experience traveling alone. However, I am planning to do some camping close to my region in the upcoming weeks or months to get some sort of feel of camping. 

Mostly I've been thinking of hitch-hiking or bicycling while camping in a tent, only because it seems like the cheapest way to travel + it seems quite fun. I prefer to start my journey in january/february, with no return date set, as I would want to travel freely. My budget would be somewhere about $5000, and I want to travel at least one month, hopefully a lot more, depending on the journey. Ideally I would've wanted to hitchhike Europe while camping, but that seems a bit hard considering winter-time in Europe is January-March. 

I would very much like to challenge myself. I am open to any suggestions, whether it may be in America or Asia. I would be truly grateful for any type of answers!"
