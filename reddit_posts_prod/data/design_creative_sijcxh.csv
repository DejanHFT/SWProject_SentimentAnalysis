What helps you to resolve your creative block?,jelindrael,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/sijcxh/what_helps_you_to_resolve_your_creative_block/,4,0,"I'm a trained designer for many years (working as a developer for about 7 years now tho) and right now, I am in the proccess of switching careers to UX design, which I love.

Now, I have a huge problem. When it comes to ideation, the first bit of idea I have is creative, but then when trying to develop something out of it, I suck. There is no way I'm able to decide what to do next.

Designing a logo: First sketch is down, but I can't decide what to try next.  
Deciding on a portfolio project idea: Literally impossible, because I have thousands of seeds someone could follow and I can't decide which one to follow, or I'll loose interest after following it for a day.

I kind of hope that this is my severe ADHD (not officially diagnosed, but 110% sure, have an appointment for diagnosis next week) and meds will resolve that (my ADHD also sabotages my progress in UX education).

**But regardless of ADHD or not, do you have creative exercises, frameworks or suggestion on how to overcome that and help the creative juices get flowing?**"
