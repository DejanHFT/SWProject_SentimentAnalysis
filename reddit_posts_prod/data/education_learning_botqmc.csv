Is student-centered learning actually effective?,AdmirableChallenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/botqmc/is_studentcentered_learning_actually_effective/,55,41,"I have been reading about [student-centered learning](https://www.potatopirates.game/blog/student-centered-learning?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=Optimize) a lot and how it's useful in getting students to be self-directed in their learning. But I keep wondering whether this will really work because in my experience, kids would probably pick play over studies right? Anyone who has tried this, what are your thoughts on it?"
