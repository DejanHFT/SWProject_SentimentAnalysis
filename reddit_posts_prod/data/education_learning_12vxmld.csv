Where to learn math online,no_thank_you_honey,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/12vxmld/where_to_learn_math_online/,12,17,"Hello, I'm from an Asia country and math has always been my weakness. But truth be told, I've always loved it. I don't wanna blame this on teachers, it's mostly the fault of our education system. It's more like ""memorise this and write that on exam paper"" kind of education rather than supporting the critical thinking. I'm studying abroad this year and while the major I'm planning to pursue doesn't need much knowledge on math, I wanna learn it again from the start. We were also taught in our language so I wanna learn it in English bc like I don't even know the basic terms of math in English language. I'm thinking to learn it from the basic till I reach the level of a high school graduate. So does anyone know any online app or website to learn math? I'd be very grateful for ur help."
