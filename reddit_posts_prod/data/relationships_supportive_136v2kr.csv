How can I [M/26] support my friend [M/24] over something that happened that was his mistake,atomicPotato97,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/136v2kr/how_can_i_m26_support_my_friend_m24_over/,48,381,"My friend has been on the edge of failing school for the last few years (which is why he's been in school for an extended period of time). He's exceeded the number of retakes and somehow managed to squeeze extra ones.

Anyways, he's been told by his faculty advisor that if gets another F this term, he will be expelled from the university.

He has this BFF that lives a couple of states over and my friend usually goes to visit him 3 times a year. However this past weekend, his BFF was coming here to visit from Thursday to Sunday and the big problem is that my friend's final is on Friday. He's on the brink of an F. If he does reasonably well, he avoids the F and if he does poorly, he will flunk out.

Instead of studying, he decided to go to a club with his BFF and got hammered. He went into the final hungover. Final grades were released on Monday and he got an F for the term and will be removed from the university. Understandably, he's distraught.

I honestly don't know how to provide him any support when the problem he's facing was created by his own (in my opinion) massively idiotic decision.

**tl;dr**: Friend flunked out of school because he came to his need to pass final exam hungover. He's in distress and I'm not even sure how to provide any support."
