"AskScience AMA Series: We're Jeff Hawkins and Subutai Ahmad, scientists at Numenta. We published a new framework for intelligence and cortical computation called ""The Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence"", with significant implications for the future of AI and machine learning. Ask us anything!",AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/bowie2/askscience_ama_series_were_jeff_hawkins_and/,243,2146,"I am Jeff Hawkins, scientist and co-founder at [Numenta](https://numenta.com/), an independent research company focused on neocortical theory. I'm here with Subutai Ahmad, VP of Research at Numenta, as well as our Open Source Community Manager, Matt Taylor. We are on a mission to figure out how the brain works and enable machine intelligence technology based on brain principles.  We've made significant progress in understanding the brain, and we believe our research offers opportunities to advance the state of AI and machine learning. 

Despite the fact that scientists have amassed an enormous amount of detailed factual knowledge about the brain, how it works is still a profound mystery. We recently published a paper titled [A Framework for Intelligence and Cortical Function Based on Grid Cells in the Neocortex](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2018.00121/full) that lays out a theoretical framework for understanding what the neocortex does and how it does it. It is commonly believed that the brain recognizes objects by extracting sensory features in a series of processing steps, which is also how today's deep learning networks work. Our new theory suggests that instead of learning one big model of the world, the neocortex learns thousands of models that operate in parallel. We call this the [Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence](https://numenta.com/blog/2019/01/16/the-thousand-brains-theory-of-intelligence/).

The Thousand Brains Theory is rich with novel ideas and concepts that can be applied to practical machine learning systems and provides a roadmap for building intelligent systems inspired by the brain.  See our links below to resources where you can learn more.

We're excited to talk with you about our work! Ask us anything about our theory, its impact on AI and machine learning, and more.
