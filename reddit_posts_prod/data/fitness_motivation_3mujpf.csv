Morbidly obese and I think I have finally motivation.,Ezada,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3mujpf/morbidly_obese_and_i_think_i_have_finally/,63,26,"I'm a 309 lb female, I have been working on getting my eating under control, been walking more, and I've started weight lifting at the gym 3 days a week. 

My office just announced the ""Flight for Breath"" event in April 2016. Essentially it's like a race but you climb stairs to help support Lung Health research. It's taking place in the tallest building which is 40 stories tall, so 40 flights of stairs. 

I want to do this, and I was wondering if anyone had a training program for something like this so I don't hurt myself. The weight is starting to come off, and I think training for this will help, because I get super bored with running and treadmills. 

Thank you in advance!"
