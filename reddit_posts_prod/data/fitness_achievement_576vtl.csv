"For those who've achieved 10% BF or less, what's your height/weight/BF% and the lowest amount of kcals you consumed to get there?",refused1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/576vtl/for_those_whove_achieved_10_bf_or_less_whats_your/,147,54,"Asking since I'm already eating at/slightly above my BMR of 1890 kcals and it's psychology tough to lower the amount any more than that. However, I'm a measly 5' 6"" (167.6cm), 175 lbs (79.5kg), 12% BF and yet I know some of you are taller and yet have eaten around that much as well. 

Will I have to eventually go lower to achieve single digit BF%? I really don't want to but will if that's what it takes."
