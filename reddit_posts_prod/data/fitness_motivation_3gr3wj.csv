How do you kickstart your motivation during a slump?,RecordEverything,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3gr3wj/how_do_you_kickstart_your_motivation_during_a/,30,6,"I've really fallen off with my training over the past month. It's summer here and I've been partying like a madman, which is fairly uncharacteristic for me. I'm past it now, but mustering up the motivation to get back into my long distance running and strength training has been difficult.

Are there any specific things you do/look to/read/listen to when trying to revive your determination and motivation to get back at your training during a slump? 

Thanks guys."
