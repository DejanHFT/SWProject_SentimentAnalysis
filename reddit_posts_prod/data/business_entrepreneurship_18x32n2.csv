What major should i choose?,Plus_Introduction937,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/18x32n2/what_major_should_i_choose/,4,0,"So i live in Estonia, but i hope you can still give me advice.

I will go for a general business degree, and it’s structured so for 1 year out of 3 everyone learns the same general stuff, and then you pick a major and specialize in that for the remaining 2 years. The 5 options for the main major are: 

1) entrepreneurship and management

2)logistics and supply chain

3)financial accounting in the digital age

4)marketing

5)business finance

which should i pick?

i do dream of creating my own company of some sort, some day, but i do realize i probably need to learn and gain experiance before. I feel like thd entrepreneurship and management one is pointless, and you won’t learn any particular skill. I think i’m leaning towards business finance, but i don’t completly understand what it is or involves.(below the major it says: ||Main subjects: financial management, financial accounting for financial managers, financial modelling, econometrics and money, financial institutions and markets.)

Does the major look alright? All opinions and advice are very much appreciated. What would you reccomend out of the 5?

PS. i see so many people talking about how accounting is the best business major etc, but i got to say in Estonia the skill is super undervalued. Starting salary after graduating is in the range of barely over the national minimum salary to about 80% of the national average salary. I feel like there’s no accountant in Estonia who makes more than 2.5 the national average, which is about 50k a year, and our cost of living is similar to the low cost of living areas of the US.

PS 2. I know how important accounting is for businesses and in general how valuable the skill is, so i’m very surprised it’s so underpaid here. Or is it, what money does accounting make over in the US?

 Thank you all in advance for help."
