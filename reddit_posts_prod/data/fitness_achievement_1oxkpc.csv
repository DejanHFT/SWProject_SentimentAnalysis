Is eating dirty a good way for achieving a calorie goal?,PunPuncher,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1oxkpc/is_eating_dirty_a_good_way_for_achieving_a/,23,1,"I eat healthy, but it seems like that is a hard thing to do when I'm bulking, so what do I do to achieve my 2600-2800 goal? I eat a Snickers, or a pack of Oreos after lunch or dinner. Is there something wrong with doing that? I mean, I'm 6' and 145 lbs, so I really want to put on some weight during the next few months, but it feels like cheating. "
