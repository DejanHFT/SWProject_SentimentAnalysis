What technologies are nearly at the maximum point of theoretical efficiency?,emdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/nbqyh/what_technologies_are_nearly_at_the_maximum_point/,152,75,"We all know about Moore's law that make computers ever more efficient every year (or 18 months ;) ), and so far, no doomsayers have been coming around to cool off our enthusiasm for ever faster and smaller computers as it seems the theoretical limits are just so far ahead.

But there are other technologies that surely rely on different processes that are mature enough to be almost at the limit; one may think of electrical generators who are well above 90% efficiency.

So, what other technologies cannot conceivably be improved much more as they are already near their maximum efficiency?"
