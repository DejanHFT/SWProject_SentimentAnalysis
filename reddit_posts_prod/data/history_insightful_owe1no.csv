"With Genghis Khan creating the largest empire in human history, where are the remnants of the spoils and riches he accumulated?",Tickomatick,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/owe1no/with_genghis_khan_creating_the_largest_empire_in/,244,964,"I believe most of the historical conquests led to wealth accumulation in the central regions and capitals. We can still see it nowadays looking at architecture of Rome for example. I wonder how was wealth from the extremely successful (and bloody) conquest of Mongolian empire during 13th century managed. Was the nomadic lifestyle the main reason the wealth of the Mongolian empire wasn't centralised and reflected in monuments one can see in other parts of the world? Thank you for your answers!


edit: thank you for pointing out my mistake about stating it was the largest empire in history. Britain was, my bad. Mongolian Empire was allegedly largest continuous empire (not broken down by borders). TIL"
