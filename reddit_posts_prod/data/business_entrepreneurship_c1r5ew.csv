Maybe the money eradicated,
Maybe the luck didn't favored.

It took Grant Cardone 6+ years to match his salary level income. It's already been 18+ months and I'm no where near of what I used to draw.

Now looking back, I realise piles of mistakes and relapses on bad habits. But now it's the time when I should focus on my family. My income and their happiness is relatable.

My dreams will be just dreams now.

Or may be I could enrol as the night shift delivery guy and pursue business in the morning, just to push and punish.

Wish me for the fuck you money, the sooner the better."
