What is a band's number one song that all fans actually like?,migrosso,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/18lehxy/what_is_a_bands_number_one_song_that_all_fans/,1714,760,"Basically the title. Unfortunately, with some genres of music I particularly enjoy, such as heavy metal and alternative rock,  some ""true fans"" believe that if their favorite artist makes it big, then they are selling out. They also tend to hate their artist's biggest songs as they view it as a symbol of them selling out
However, are there any songs that escape from this nonsense, and wre still viewed as masterpieces?

For me, piano man kind of symbolises this, but I wanted to see what other suggestions you all have."
