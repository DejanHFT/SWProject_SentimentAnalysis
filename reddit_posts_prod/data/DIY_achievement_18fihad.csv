Finish gable windows,KilledByALover,https://i.redd.it/xhpqjn48fk5c1.jpg,2,5,"Need to be able to block the sun in the early morning, windows face East.

Blinds or curtains?  Can curtains be achieved with the A-frame of the ceiling? Do they make a product for this or is there a common solution?  Or just blind each of the three windows? Seems like the later option might look odd or basic. Opinions?"
