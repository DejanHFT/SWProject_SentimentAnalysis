What is the first movie you saw that opened your eyes to a new world of cinema?,TheKrakenLord,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/15mnt5g/what_is_the_first_movie_you_saw_that_opened_your/,888,473,"Many of us grow up watching Hollywood's output... but there comes a moment in life in which you are shown a movie from another country, from a director you had never heard of, in a style you didn't know existed, and that opens your eyes to a whole new world of cinema (yes, I am repeating the title of the post, I have three-hundred characters to write). What was that movie for you, whether it was an art movie, an European movie, an indie movie?

In my personal experience I remember watching Delicatessen when I was 17, in the cinema club at my university. At that point in my life it had all been Hollywood blockbusters, Disney, the whole commercial thing. And it totally blew my mind! It challenged all I ever thought a movie could visually offer."
