Please help me decide the worse decision I'll ever make in my life,rj7jr37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9il84/please_help_me_decide_the_worse_decision_ill_ever/,555,1027,"I have terminal brain cancer and am expected to live for only the next couple of months.  I live alone except for my companion of five years Abby.  She is the greatest dog in the world.  The problem is is that she has totally bonded with me and is almost aggressive to people.  She has been my constant companion and, I believe, the main reason I have survived with cancer for as long as I have.  I have nobody to take care of her when I die.  I could take her to an animal shelter or put her down.  She is an old dog so her chances of ever being adopted are slim and none.  Her life up to now has been about as perfect as a dogs could be and we have never been apart unless I was in the hospital.  
Could you tell me what I should do?  Have her put to sleep or live out her live in an animal shelter?
