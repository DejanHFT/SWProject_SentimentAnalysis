Struggling to be supportive after my [25F] girlfriend [26F] lied about where she was and possibly raped [Update],Throwaway113088,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2b9ebw/struggling_to_be_supportive_after_my_25f/,35,56,"[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2b1le0/struggling_to_be_supportive_after_my_25f/). 

  
Not a WHOLE lot to update on, but we made a bit of progress this weekend. First to clear a few things up:  
  
1) Allen was her friend of nearly 10 years, and she bought Vicodin from him a few times. He wasn't a random, unknown drug dealer. I was uncomfortable with them remaining friends after she quit the Vic, but she's an adult who can make her own choices.  
  
2) We aren't going to the police. There simply isn't enough hard evidence of anything either way, and neither of us think it would be conducive her mental well being to go through a bunch of legal he-said-she-said; particularly in light of her not remembering anything, and her past drug use.   
 
   
  
This weekend was rough. On the drive to her family's cottage we talked a little, then agreed we were pretty much going to ignore it for the weekend and try to get a little peace of mind and relaxation. Of course, we ended up talking about it at a few points.  
  
Friday night I woke up around 3:30am to her screaming and crying in her sleep. When I finally got her awake she was inconsolable for quite a while, she calmed down and we went outside for a cigarette. She had a disjointed, confusing dream about being in a room in the dark and looking up to see him in the doorway. I reassured her as best I could, and we went to bed. The same thing happened Saturday night, but she had a vivid dream of laying in the dark and someone having sex with her, but she couldn't see anything. We're not sure if these are situations of bits and pieces of her memory coming back to her (as I've read can happen occasionally with drug induced blackouts), or if the idea has wormed it's way into her mind so much as to cause her subconscious to play it out via dream. Either way, waking up to your girlfriend screaming in terror is horrific.  
  
We talked about her drug use, she agrees she should have gone to get counseling when she first quit and it has been a struggle. But she also pointed out that every time she's had a craving since then, she's talked to me about it. Which she has, several times she's had a bad day and called to ask me to come over, and she's admitted to having that feeling of ""if I just took a pill I'd feel better,"" but she hasn't. In light of that, and the night terrors, we agreed it's time for her to get counseling. The plan is to try to find someone who specializes in either drug abuse or rape survivorship.  
  
At this point, since we aren't pursuing legal action, all that matters is she feels that she was violated in some way. That's what we're working to fix.  
  
We did touch on the subject of her lying. She apologized profusely, admitted she understands it was wrong, and I have every reason to leave her. I told her how disrespected I'm feeling, and that her thinking what she did was ok (at the time) calls into question what else she'll think is ok to lie and sneak around about in the future. We agreed if we choose to work this out, she'll have a long way to go in rebuilding that trust. She asked me if, once she gets into counseling, and if we choose to stay together, if I would be open to coming into counseling sessions with her, and I thought that was a good idea. She certainly needs to work out some issues on her own, but some professional guidance for us couldn't hurt. I haven't made any decisions as of yet; I flat out told her I'm too overwhelmed with everything, and will likely need to talk out more things with her as I process them. But, for now, I'm on her side in terms of getting her through whatever happened. She understands me having conflicting feelings of wanting to help her, and also being very angry with her.  
  
I'm still at a loss of how to handle a lot of things. I'm scared of saying the wrong thing, making an inappropriate joke, being too overbearing with her physically...and balancing all of that without making her feel like I'm treating her differently. It's something we'll likely discuss this week.  
  
The subject of her getting tested for STDs didn't come up, and I'm not sure how to bring it up, it makes me really uncomfortable...but it's something that will have to be done. I'm thinking I'll probably try to find a free clinic nearby and offer to go get tested too, maybe that will make her more comfortable.

**tl;dr**: Discussed a lot of what happened and what will happen going forward, taking things one day at a time."
