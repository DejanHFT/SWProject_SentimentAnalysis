How to motivate my partner,monpellierre2805,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5x53ag/how_to_motivate_my_partner/,23,4,"How do I motivate my partner? My girlfriend and mother to my 2 kids has struggled with her weight since the birth of our first child, gaining approx 5 stone. She's not too keen on exercise and cancels the gym after being a member for a month and going twice.

I've cut down how many takeaways and ""treats"" we have and I'm loosing weight and going to the gym, but she seems to struggle.

I've suggested slimming world and other groups, were in the UK, but she uses the lack of spare money to do any of these. I've offered to pay for slimming world as well as the gym but she refuses help! 

I'm just looking for any suggestions for help to motivate her to loose weight. She's going to New York in September for a wedding and aims to loose 4 stone by then but just isn't getting motivated yet saying she can loose it easily in plenty of time but I'm not sure!
