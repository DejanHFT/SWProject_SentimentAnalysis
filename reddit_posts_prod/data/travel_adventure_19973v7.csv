Help me pick a first solo adventure! Interrailing? Kiwi experience? Something totally different?,itfeelscorrect,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/19973v7/help_me_pick_a_first_solo_adventure_interrailing/,1,1,"Hello!

I’m looking at getting a solo trip booked after I graduate uni this year. I’ve not travelled much and have spent much of my youth so far prioritising schoolwork and professional experiences. Summers spent doing internships instead of holidays. I’ve always been a bit of a control freak and felt quite tied to my responsibilities. I’m really keen to step out of my comfort zone and have a bit of an adventure once I’m finished up with school. I want to do something for myself for the sake of having fun, exploring and trying new things. 

So, I know I want to travel. I am however extremely indecisive and am finding it hard to pin down an idea. I’m looking at probably heading out in late july/august for 3-4 weeks. I don’t have a budget (yet) but think I could probably dedicate £3k-ish, although there’s time to work and save for more. Some of the things I’ve thought about/am looking for are:

- I’m not necessarily looking for sun.
- I’m not really an adrenaline junkie. 
- This will be my first big solo trip, and I am quite an anxious person, so don’t want to bite off more than I can chew. 
- Happy to hostel!
- I’m 21 and female, so safety is a priority. 
- I’m interested in culture and history. 

My initial ideas have either been interrailing round Europe or the Kiwi Experience. Interrailing appeals because I like city breaks, and I think it would be a cool way to see lots of cities. It scares me a little because it’s a big logistical challenge to organise, and I’ve heard from friends that some cities can be a hit or a miss safety-wise. The Kiwi experience appeals because it would take a lot of the logistical planning out of my hands. It also feels like more of an adventure than Europe, and I think it would be a nice way to not get lonely. It worries me because August is their winter time, so I’m apprehensive about activities and tours being cancelled due to weather. I’m also a tad intimidated that I’d find it a bit overwhelming. I do like to party and spend time with people but i ultimately am an introvert who sometimes needs time to myself. Also, a lot of the activities offered are big adrenaline activities like skydiving or bungee jumping. This isn’t really for me. 

I’d love to hear your recommendations either way, or for something else! What’s your best recommendation for a nervous solo travellers first adventure?"
