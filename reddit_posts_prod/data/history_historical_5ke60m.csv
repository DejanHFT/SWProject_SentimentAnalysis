Any Recommended Historical Drama Series?,AethelredTheUnread,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5ke60m/any_recommended_historical_drama_series/,212,221,"I love history and drama, so the two blended together seems like a great mix. Unfortunately from my experience historical accuracy seems to take a backseat to drama, and the history part of the show is usually only a ""mise en sc√®ne"" for the dramatic narrative. 

I've enjoyed Vikings even despite the fact that I know much of it doesn't accurately portray what the Vikings were actually like, not to mention the fact that Ragnar is actually semi-mythic. I'd prefer to be learning about real history while I follow the drama however...

So please let me know Reddit, are there any damn fine historically accurate dramas on television these days?"
