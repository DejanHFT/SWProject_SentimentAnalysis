Hidden Gems in Literary Circles,anonymousaspirant,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lh71n6/hidden_gems_in_literary_circles/,28,40,"The other day I picked up the fantasy novel Little, Big by John Crowley from my public library. It was wonderful and I was shocked to later see the love for this book within the literary community. Harold Bloom was apparently enamored by the story and one of the dust jacket blurbs proclaimed, ""prose that would make Fitzgerland weep.""   


Bloom referred to it as a ""neglected masterpiece."" This made me wonder: how many other such ""neglected masterpieces"" are there.  


I'm talking about books that have all the power of the great classics and are revered by a narrow readership but, for whatever reason, never gained prominence or commercial success.  


Please share any example you have! Thank you!"
