Work wife/close friend (32F) making rash decisions in her personal life which is affecting our work and our friendship. How do I be most supportive?,tseWeynaC,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/upllrg/work_wifeclose_friend_32f_making_rash_decisions/,8,3,"I (28NB) met my friend, let’s call her Laura (34F), about 4 years ago at work. We always had a casual relationship but as I got more responsibilities and opportunities at our work, she was the one to train me and we became very close. We work in higher education and basically became her co-teacher for the course - I coordinate all the student needs and staffing for certain sections and she delivers the lecture content. I’ve loved learning from her as I feel like it’s helped me grow into this position. She is well respected in our field and has further degrees and experience so I would come to her for advice and guidance on many topics and she would come to me for fresh ideas, new perspective, and advice on how to use Excel. 

Besides respecting and looking up to her in a professional capacity, Laura and I just got along very well. We both are vegans and shared a love of animals and vegan food. We both volunteer in our off time at similar organizations. And we both love wine and a good round of Monopoly! She would watch my dog when my partner and I went on vacation and I would bake her new treats with the lemons she brought from her property. I’m also suffering from some health problems this year and she has been the most supportive friend. We would talk on the phone each day and she would check in on me frequently. 

A bit more background about Laura before we dive into the current drama. Throughout the last 4 years of our relationship, Laura had been living on a large farm property about 2 hours from where we work with her boyfriend of 5 years, Scott(50’s M). Scott and Laura had been on the outs for the last year or so, but Scott worked away from home for weeks at a time and would only come back for a few days so Laura kept living there. They would have drama occasionally but he would leave again and they would be fine. While living on this farm, Laura began to rescue animals and started what you could call a small sanctuary. She had goats, pigs, cats, dogs, horses, and one cow. Taking care of these animals was her whole life and made her happy at the time. Her and Scott, however, continued to fall apart and she began looking for her own place to buy land and bring the animals. She eventually found a place she could afford and bring them all with her and it would be available May 1st. 

About two weeks before May, Laura was set up on a blind date with a man named Adam (50’sM). Even though she wasn’t technically out of Scott’s house - she decided to go on the date. She said she had a good time but worried Adam was too short for her. About a week later, we had the first day of a new class and Laura did not show up at all. This was extremely unlike her but I couldn’t even reach her via text or call to either her work or personal phone. We eventually find out that she was arrested two nights before on a domestic violence charge and had lost her phones. What she told me was that Scott found out about Adam and got mad - trying to kick her off the property and in the ensuing argument she scratched him. She said since she didn’t have any marks on her, the cops said they needed to arrest her as the aggressor. 

New boo Adam steps in and paid her bail and after 10 days of knowing him she decided to move into his apartment. She backed out of the deal for the property she was set to move into and gave up 30 animals to the humane society since she would only keep one small dog as Adam lives in a city apartment. She is using all of her vacation time to take impromptu trips with Adam now - saying that if she doesn’t take them now she’ll lose the days (just not true - we work for the largest university in the state). I am ALL for work life balance and using your vacation time, however, we have 2-3 weeks between classes 4 times a year which is a great time to plan an international trip. What shes doing now leaves our students and staff in the lurch as we have to scramble for coverage and the students are not getting the experience they need for this particular course. It also leaves me managing the needs of about 150 students on my own. 

Today, Laura sent me a picture - she’s engaged to Adam after knowing him 17 days. I feel really judgmental even typing this out but I don’t want her to get hurt again and I don’t know how to be happy for her. 

Any advice, firstly from a professional standpoint - how do I keep doing my job well without building resentment for her never being around? 

Secondly, from a personal standpoint- how do I get over the loss of who I thought my friend was and move forward being happy for her new choices even if I don’t agree? 


TL:DR - work and personal friend recently caught up in a whirlwind romance which changes many core things I liked about her. How do I get over myself and support her?"
