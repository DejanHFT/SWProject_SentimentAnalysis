What exactly do teachers do in Self-Directed Learning classes?,alphardzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/g8ied7/what_exactly_do_teachers_do_in_selfdirected/,19,31,"Hi everyone, I have a sister who studies at a school with “self-directed learning” classes. I admit that this concept is wholly unfamiliar to me as we did not have this class back then. 
My question is what exactly is the teachers’ role in this setup? My sister told me that there are sometimes 2-3 teachers in the same class who are answering questions. Wouldn’t that be the same as a regular classroom? Apologies if this has been asked before or if this isn’t the right sub. The SDL classes are quite pricey and I just want to know if it’s worth it."
