What's the most subtle literary allusion you've found in a book?,tillerman35,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11503e9/whats_the_most_subtle_literary_allusion_youve/,11,11,"By ""subtle"" I mean one that you think very few people, if any, would catch.  That could be for a number of reasons.  Perhaps the way it's presented is very off-hand (some others like to ""hide"" allusions, others like to knock you over the head with them).  Or maybe it's referring to a work that few people would have read, or a passage in a well-known work that isn't often quoted.  
  
I'll give you the one I'm thinking of as an example.  
  
In the book ""Little, Big"" by John Crowley, the main character (at the time) receives a gift of a hat.  The paragraph reads:  
  
> ""What more?"" Mr. Woods said, looking around him, finger to his lips.  Mrs. Underhill with one of her needles pointed to a round leather box on top of the cupboard.  
Right! Mr. Woods said.  ""How about this?""  He finger the box from its high place until it fell into his arms.  He popped open the lid.  ""A hat!""  
It was a red hat, high-crowned and soft, belted with a little plaited belt in which a white owl's feather nodded.  Mr. Woods and Mrs. Underhill said Aaaaah, and watched closely as Mr. Woods fitted it to Smokey's head.  ...  
  
I'm spoiler-izing the following few lines so I don't ruin the book for anyone (plus you can make your guess and see if you're right!)  

If you need a little hint: >!The book is subtitled ""or, The Fairies' Parliament""!<

>!The paragraph I quoted is referring to a poem called ""The Fairies,"" by William Allingham.  It starts with:!<  
>!Up the airy mountain,!<  
>!Down the rushy glen,!<  
>!We daren’t go a-hunting!<  
>!For fear of little men;!<  
>!Wee folk, good folk,!<  
>!Trooping all together;!<  
>!Green jacket, __red cap__,!<  
>!And __white owl’s feather__!!**<

Subtle?  Or am I underestimating the number of people who would catch this reference?  I'm 100% sure this is an allusion to the work I mentioned because the 6th line quoted above is used in a completely off-hand manner in another of the Author's books.  
  
NOTE: This is a do-over.  The first time I submitted this, I had issues using the spoiler tags."
