"r/Fitness, I need all the tricks you have to achieve a 'bigger'/more prominent rear end.",NEEDSMOARASS,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/j190r/rfitness_i_need_all_the_tricks_you_have_to/,62,29,"I started doing squats/lunges about a month ago using two 10 lb dumbbells (moved up to two 20s a week ago) and recently started dumbbell deadlifts. I'm new to wt training so I'm not sure if the problem is too little weight (I'm 5'4 110 lbs) or if I need to add more exercises or if I'm doing something else wrong. I'm in decent shape but I feel like my butt is kinda flat and super... 'soft' or jiggly, I'd like it to be firmer. 

I would use a barbell instead of DBs but my buildings gym doesn't have any. 

Does it make a difference for someone as small as me if I'm not getting much protein post w/o? 

All advice appreciated, thanks! "
