Played Civ 6 and found it boring; Strategy Game Suggestions/recommendations?,BrieflyLiving,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/114i269/played_civ_6_and_found_it_boring_strategy_game/,30,3,"Hi, 

Tried Civ 6 and found it really boring: It felt more like an Idle/management game than a strategy game + gameplay that takes too long. I remember playing Civ younger very briefly with a friend and really enjoying it. But not anymore. (I don't remember which CIv it was  


**Would love some strategy game:** 

* Nation/city building
* Where I can win in 1 or 2 evenings of 1/2h of gaming and not take me a whole week.
* Enough complexity but directly linked to the end goal of the game (civ felt like running multiple independent games around science, culture, religion etc., not a single game)
* Turn based or Real-time are both fine for me. Would love to try more turn based. games though. Civ is my only experience. If turn based, would love for it to be as tactical as managerial (not almost and idle game).  


To give an idea, games I played and loved before: Stronghold Crusader, Settlers III, Settlers III, AOE 2 (all real time as you can see, but as said, would love to find some good turn based one, a bit chess-like but with a feeling of building stuff).

Thanks!"
