Can “inspirational writing” be used in fiction?,mysocalledjinx,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/198xr5e/can_inspirational_writing_be_used_in_fiction/,9,0,"Now, I don’t particularly want to believe everything that I partake in on the internet as reality, however I decided to take a quick online test to see “what type of writer” I am. It gave me the result of being an Inspirational Writer.

 … and as much as I agree with that conclusion, I’m not really sure where exactly — in terms of genre — that type of writing would be able to shine. I’m quite capable of putting my Self into my writing and that is how I’m able to deal with most of my problems (at least mentally and in the spiritual realm), which is good enough.

I’m just wondering if Fiction is the “right” genre to pursue when it comes to being inspired, inspiring and inspirational. … or if this type of thing would be better suited by going in a different direction or approaching my writing in a different way (than self help for example)."
