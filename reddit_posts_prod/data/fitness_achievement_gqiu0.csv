"I ran 6.2 miles in an hour today, which might be the biggest cardio achievement of my life. Hooray for quitting smoking!",coolhandlucas,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/gqiu0/i_ran_62_miles_in_an_hour_today_which_might_be/,64,422,"I just quit about four weeks ago, which still puts me in relapse zone - I had ""quit"" many times over the two years before that. I'm loving the way I can run now, though. I've normally been doing about a mile a day just to warm up, but something clicked today and after that first mile I just zoned out and started to think about other things. All of the normal irritation in my left ankle and knee vanished and I completely lost track of time until suddenly I looked down and realized how far I had run. 

Just patting myself on the head :) Never posted on Fittit before, but you guys have been keeping me motivated for quite a while. I'll do before/after pics when I feel like I have something to show off."
