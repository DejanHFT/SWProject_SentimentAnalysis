Security camera using old phone,Wonderful_Date_8804,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/18zb64s/security_camera_using_old_phone/,1,1,"I have a 4 year old Samsung phone. It's display went off and changing the display is not financially feasible for an old phone. I am planning to use that as security camera, but how to achieve that if the display is not working?

If you have any other uses of that old phone, kindly drop that idea also.. will think about that as well"
