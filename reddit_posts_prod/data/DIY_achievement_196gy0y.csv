Restaining bathroom vanity,philsphan26,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/196gy0y/restaining_bathroom_vanity/,1,0,"Bathroom vanity cabinet is looking like it needs to be restained. What is best way to achieve ? Should I sand first , restain then cover with something? Or are there any stains that will match that wonâ€™t require sanding ? Any help is appreciated
