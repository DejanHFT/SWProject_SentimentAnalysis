"What is the mechanism of the degradation of elastic textiles, like lycra, spandex, and elastane, and how can it be avoided?",Ramses-II,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/11l66en/what_is_the_mechanism_of_the_degradation_of/,3,13,"Excluding overstretching and abuse of the textiles, what are the physical and chemical causes, which make it go ""bad"", lose elasticity and create a distinct smell?
