What literary movement are we in right now?,RevolutionaryTie8481,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xcbvzu/what_literary_movement_are_we_in_right_now/,115,57,"I know only time will be able to tell what literary movement a certain time period was but do you guys have any predictions on what this certain decade/last few decades will be labeled in the future?

The only big source that I could find was [here,](https://www.storyboardthat.com/lesson-plans/american-literary-movements) where it's stated that we're in the post-modernist movement, dating from the 1950s to the present day. But today's contemporary literature has changed vastly since, and I can't imagine the books published today to be categorized in the same boxes as works from Steinback, Salinger, Hemmingway, or Plath. Time and influence have definitely changed since the 50s, as the themes of post-war are no longer discussed or heavily alluded to. 

Literature has rapidly changed over the last few decades in the expansion of new genres and generally the way we view literature (ie. popular ""trashy"" books that sell millions vs. highly acclaimed works that aren't recognized by the general audience). There are also a lot of niches and genres created since, and a HUGE number of books are printed and published in today's age compared to any other time in history. 

The last ""huge"" literary movement that happened recently that I can recall is probably the surge of YA fiction, especially that of YA dystopia or even YA paranormal romance, but that lasted only a few years, owed its huge success to movie adaptations, and doesn't have any substantial ""quality"" as classics do. They also aren't read anymore and were a popular phase, much like books from BookTok. 

Do you guys think that there will be one huge literary movement that will define our current era? Or do you guys think the future of literature will just change as a whole, like just popular books with recurrent themes? 

(Sorry if the question is confusing - I'm only a reader and not educated in English Lit/Literature. I'm happy for any corrections or a point of clarification!)"
