I don’t know where to start,Jewelz-papi,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/10m309l/i_dont_know_where_to_start/,2,2,"
First I think is should go back to high school a bit, in high school I take a entrepreneurship class and it opened my eyes to the self potential of entrepreneurship. So I started doing anything to make money from sells snacks at school to replacing classmates broken iPhone screen to even cleaning and customizing sneakers. Now that I’m older and been in the work force for a while I lost that drive and creativity I once had

I know I still want to be an entrepreneur but I want to run businesses such as a barbershop, laundry mat and hopefully a strip club. So I still have the big goals for myself I just don’t know how to get there anymore and just feel stuck."
