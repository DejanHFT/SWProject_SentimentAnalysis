What's a song you love that's too sad to listen to?,NeptunesCurse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/wbhm1p/whats_a_song_you_love_thats_too_sad_to_listen_to/,182,28,"There are a few but off the top of my head I'd say Final Exit by Fear Factory. Hits too close to home in a lot of ways.

Fitter Happier by Radio Head. Extreme melancholy always sets in after that one. I can't help but question my existence in the world and why I do what I do.

What about y'all?"
