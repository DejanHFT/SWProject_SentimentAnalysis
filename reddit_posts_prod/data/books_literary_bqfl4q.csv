What is this literary genre called?,lanarc,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bqfl4q/what_is_this_literary_genre_called/,39,79,"Hi, mandatory apologies because I'm on mobile.

I have a problem naming this genre when applied to books: desert, murder mysteries, something supernatural going on. Possibly some motels and diners thrown into the mix. The atmosphere is similar to Welcome to Night Vale and The X Files. 

Could it be southwestern gothic, or is there a better way to describe it?

I'm sorry, I know this is reaally specific, but I appreciate any help! Thank you so much!

EDIT: Wow, thank you all so much for your help! I have a better idea of what genres I can go through, and I got some great recs. You're amazing, thank you!"
