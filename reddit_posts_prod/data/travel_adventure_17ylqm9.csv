"Trip report: 3-week food, wine, and adventure Australia itinerary",kissakissa,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17ylqm9/trip_report_3week_food_wine_and_adventure/,20,45,"G'day friends! Husband and I (mid-30s/early 40s, no kids) returned a month ago from an absolutely amazing nearly three week trip to OZ, and we wanted to report back on our trip, in case anyone is looking for advice on similar itineraries in the future! Lurking on this sub was helpful for me when planning, so I wanted to return the favor.

**Background**: husband and I had three weeks set aside in September/October for our first wedding anniversary trip but hadn't actually planned where to go. A couple months out, we sat down and literally plugged random countries into Google Flights to see what had reasonable prices, and we found an incredible deal for a one-stop RT flight from Austin to Sydney for $950USD!! It was basic economy, but I have status on American Airlines, so we got the perks of regular economy, including being able to upgrade with miles. We got an upgrade to business on our outbound flight (AUS>LAX>SYD) for 25K points + $350USD each, which was still an incredible deal for business class! We were able to sleep on the way out and hit the ground running when we arrived in SYD at 7am.

**Cost**: Australia is....not cheap. There are no limits to how expensive you could make things if you wanted to, but we found that even the more budget options were not super budget and were pretty comparable to USD prices. Not including the international airfare, I think we probably clocked in about $10K-12K for the three weeks, and that was a mix of some splurge experiences/hotels and some very budget ones. This also is affected by the number of domestic flights we took--all but one were paid with cash (the other was points and luckily it was the most expensive one: CNS >AYQ). Car rentals were pretty reasonable.

**People**: Australians are really nice. We come from what many people consider to be a pretty friendly state (except for, ya know, the Republicans and the guns), but we were truly just in awe of how nice Australians were--everyone from the Australians on the liveaboard with us, to the airbnb hosts, to the service workers at restaurants and wineries. Small talk didn't feel like small talk; it felt like genuine interest about who we were, what our plans were, why we were certain places. The only sort of ""off"" encounters we had were with a couple people (both at gas stations--one in Cairns and one in the outback) who made low-key racist comments about the indigenous people. Of course, we are white, so they were nice *to us*, but we were definitely a bit taken aback by the comments. Apart from that, all we could think as we watched people run along the coast in the middle of the day on a weekday and enjoy wine with their Tuesday business lunches was that this is what it looks like when you live in a country that actually gives a shit about its people (or at least really tries). Made us a little jealous. ðŸ˜‚

**Animals**: probably won't be surprised to hear that literally every time we told someone we were coming to Australia, they'd mention any number of the wild and dangerous animals they've got! But for better or for worse, we didn't really encounter any of the dangerous things--we never even saw a single snake (and we only saw one spider!). We saw a nurse shark and reef shark during our dives, but no great whites; and we saw only two saltwater crocs on our river cruise. We did see several cassowaries though!!! Which was fun. But overall, the lack of wildlife that we saw, even though we were in pretty remote places, was surprising!

**Itinerary**: Husband and I love nature, adventure, food, and wine, and we were also certified divers. Though this itinerary included a lot of domestic air travel, the airports there are so efficient that it did not take up too much time or make us lose entire days to travel. We packed a lot into our trip, but with the three weeks, we didn't feel like we were too busy or overwhelmed, and while we frontloaded a lot, we accounted for some relaxation on the back end. Here are the bulletpoints, with highlights:

* 2 nights/3 full days **Sydney**\--stayed at the Shangri-La (dated but nice hotel, fantastic view, great central location). Did the Bondi to Bronte beach walk, which was a lovely way to stave off jetlag and we got to see whales from the shore. Was absolutely obsessed with the ocean-side swimming pools, so we went to Coogee beach the next day to enjoy the Wylie Baths, which were amazing. Also did the Manly ferry at sunset, walked across the Harbor Bridge, and visited the Hyde Park Barracks Museum (incredible, and I'm not a museum person!). Best meals were: Aalia, dim sum at Mr. Wong, and Ho Jiak. Also went to Cantina OK and Baxter Inn--I preferred the latter, but I have to say that overall we were not super impressed with the cocktails we had in Sydney.
* 4pm flight to **Cairns** for 2 night liveaboard--stayed at the Ramada Inn the night before our liveaboard (was cheap so filled the need, but would not recommend). Ate at Yaya's Hellenic Kitchen--really great meal. Liveaboard was with ProDive, and was a great experience! Was very reasonably priced for us relatively new divers on our first liveaboard. Coral was in much better shape than I was expecting, and while visibility wasn't great the first day, it got progressively better and was wonderful the last day. Also a lot of Australians on our boat, so we had a great time meeting some ""locals.""
* 2 nights **Port Douglas**\--rented a car in Cairns and drove up to stay at the Mai Tai Inn just outside Port Douglas (absolutely lovely hotel in the rainforest above the city with an amazing host and the cutest dogs). We did all the hits in this area: Cape Tribulation, Daintree Rainforest (and Daintree Ice Cream Company), Daintree River Crocodile Cruise, Mossman Gorge. It was torture to be not to be able to swim at as beautiful a beach as Cape Trib!! We drove into Port each night to have dinner with some friends we met on the liveaboard, and the meals (Zinc and Jungle Fowl) were good but not great.
* 1 night back in **Cairns**\--stayed at Holiday Inn off the Esplanade (way better than the Ramada but still not great). Walked all the way up and down the Esplanade and ate dinner at Bellocale, which was great.
* 12pm flight to **Yulara** for 2 nights--stayed at Sails in the Desert (incredibly expensive, but we were able to book through the Chase Sapphire Reserve travel portal and use points to decrease cash outlay; absolutely not worth the price, but pickings are slim, and it was nice) and had a rental car. We were blown away by Uluru. We did the full base walk, as well as the gorge hike in Kata Tjuta, and both were breathtakingly beautiful. Also did an astro tour with a company that was allowed to go into the park at night--the tour itself was meh but the photo we got of us with the milky way in the background was amazing. Absolute highlight was Tali Wiru though. The sunset views and canapes were absolutely amazing, the several course meal paired with all-Australian wine was delicious, the startalk was better than our tour the night before, and then campfire + hot chocolate + cognac was wonderful. Really one of the coolest things we've ever done.
* 1 night **Alice Springs**\--Drove from Uluru to King's Canyon and were able to squeeze in the gorge walk and some of the Southern Rim walk, which was great. This was a very long day of driving, but the outback--including the sheer isolation--was stunning. We stayed at the Doubletree Hotel in Alice, which was fine but nothing to write home about. We'd been warned so much about crime in Alice that, once we arrived at the hotel that had a gated parking lot, we decided to just order room service (which was not good). Alice was basically just a pit stop for us: we were actually able to get a cheaper one-way car rental and it gave us a direct flight option to Adelaide after.
* 8am flight to Adelaide for one night in **Port Noalunga**\--picked up a rental car here, and stayed at an airbnb in basically the McClaren Vale area. Had wine pairing lunch at Penfolds' Magill Estate Kitchen, which was fantastic. We then drove down the D'Arenberg, which honestly sucked. Don't get us wrong: the building itself is very cool, the view is great, and if you like art, obviously having something like a Salvador Dali exhibit was great. But the service was awful (so awful that when we decided we wanted to just get a refund on the wine tasting and skip it, they gave us our money back and still gave us a free tasting) and the wine itself was not good. Wanting to redeem our McClaren Vale experience, we went to Chalk Hill, where we got wonderful service. We then checked into our Airbnb in Port Noalunga, which had the absolute best Oz hosts and was right where the river met the ocean. Ate dinner at Noori, which was a fantastic wine bar, and our hosts ended up there after dinner, so we partied with them and had a fabulous time.
* 2 nights **Kangaroo Island**\--drove down to the (super expensive!) Sealink ferry to KI. Stayed at Stowaway KI, at the Sleepy Hollow property--truly incredible property and amenities (with a price tag to match) right south of the breathtaking Stokes Bay. Did a private tour at the KI Wildlife Sanctuary where we got to hold koalas and feed KI kangaroos--mostly enjoyed this experience but can tell they've changed their business model from just being a sanctuary for animals after the wildfires to taking in animals that aren't native to the area (like dingos and american alligators). Also did a dolphin swim with KI Marine Adventures, and our weather wasn't great, but we still got to swim with them a bit which was wonderful (and very cold). Best meal here was the KI Oyster Farm, and we also enjoyed one night in the accommodation making a charcuterie plate dinner out of all the goodies they left us. Vivonne Bay was also lovely, and we would've made it to Flinders Chase if our shitty car rental hadn't broken down on us on the way there. Luckily, an RAA tow truck driver happened to pass by us on his way home, and he towed the car for free and got us a new rental at the airport. The hospitality of people on KI was unmatched!
* 2 nights **Barossa**\--stayed at an airbnb on the 1847 Wine property. The grounds were gorgeous but the airbnb itself was just fine. We did wine tastings at David Franz, Torbreck, Henschke (the Hill of Grace experience), and Hentley Farm. We used a consolidation service (Get Freighted) to ship wine home from the latter three, and bought a bottle at the former to stuff in our suitcases. All these wineries were fantastic, but the Hill of Grace and Hentley Farm experiences were absolute standouts. For food, we were in Barossa on a Monday and Tuesday, and reader beware: everything is pretty much closed on those days. So we ate at Vintner's Bar and Grill and Ember Pizza, which were both solid but not mind-blowing. We did eat lunch at Fino's, which was very very good.
* 12pm flight to **Sydney** for 2 nights--stayed at the Old Clare Hotel, which was a very cool, hip place, but maybe a little too hip for its own good. Saw a show at the Sydney Opera House (Dimanche--highly recommend), visited the White Rabbit gallery, and bought art at the Big Design Market at the Carriageworks . We ate at 10 Williams Street (fantastic), Nanjing Dumpling (also fantastic), and Quay. The latter was our anniversary dinner, so we did the 6 course meal at sunset with the wine pairing, and it was truly amazing.

**Overall impressions**: given that we booked this trip on a whim, we didn't have many expectations about Australia, and perhaps it was because of that that we were absolutely blown away by how much we loved it. We especially loved South Australia (Barossa and KI) and Sydney, and we could easily see ourselves living in either place. The nature is unparalleled in its beauty and variety, and we just loved the vibe of everywhere we went. We hope to make it back one day!!"
