What historical figures are so genius that they make garden variety genius look normal?,Bobbluered,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/jbvlaz/what_historical_figures_are_so_genius_that_they/,115,37,"Obviously, Da Vinci is the first example that springs to mind- the number of inventions and concepts and the like that he imagined which were centuries ahead of his time speak for themselves- but I’m looking for as many examples as possible for a list I’m composing with my roommate for a lark. So far I have Da Vinci, Henry Cavendish FRS (His discovery of Hydrogen is only the very top of the iceberg- that guy thought up more than I thought one man could think up in a lifetime), Shakespeare (His work is so stunning that every time I even consider it I feel bad about my own limited writing capabilities) and Sir Isaac Newton (There’s a phenomenal write up about exactly how smart he was in Bill Bryson’s “A Short History of Nearly Everything”, which I highly recommend. 

Does anybody have any other ideas? I want to make this list pretty comprehensive, so few free to include geniuses from all fields- math, science, literature, politics, whatever."
