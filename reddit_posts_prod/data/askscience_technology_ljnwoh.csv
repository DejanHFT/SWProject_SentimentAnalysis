Could mRNA technology be used to improve the seasonal flu vaccine?,auraseer,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ljnwoh/could_mrna_technology_be_used_to_improve_the/,11,19,"I've read several articles that claim mRNA vaccines make changing the payload very easy. It's a supposedly simple matter of producing the same vehicle but with a different mRNA strand inside. I've read claims that if we needed an updated vaccine to handle the new COVID strains, it could be made in a few weeks.

Would this tech be adaptable to the seasonal flu vaccine? Would it give advantage over the current production methods? 

Could this let us make vaccines that better match circulating strains, because we wouldn't have to start production so far in advance of flu season?

Could this remove the dependency on huge numbers of chicken eggs for flu vaccine production?"
