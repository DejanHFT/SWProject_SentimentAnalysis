Why not everyone on the world not trying to make a sci-fi utopia?,Ioannou2005,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/15yhk2o/why_not_everyone_on_the_world_not_trying_to_make/,311,189,"I have always been fascinated by sci-fi stories and movies that depict a future where humanity has achieved amazing things like interstellar travel, advanced technology, and harmony with nature. I wonder why we are not striving for such a vision as a collective species. Why are we still stuck in wars, poverty, pollution, and ignorance? Why are we not investing more in science, education, exploration, and innovation? Why are we not collaborating more with each other to solve our common problems and challenges? Is it because of greed, fear, apathy, or something else? What can we do to change this situation and make our world more like a sci-fi utopia?"""
