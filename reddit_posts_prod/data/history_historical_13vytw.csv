How historically accurate was LINCOLN?,dirtypoison,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/13vytw/how_historically_accurate_was_lincoln/,91,160,"Just saw Lincoln, really liked. However, just wondering how historically accurate it actually was? Was it biased or did they turn somethings around? Did we also learn anything new about Lincoln through this movie or was he portrayed precisely too? 

Really interested in history but not that well-read on the Civil War (not American) and therefore wondering"
