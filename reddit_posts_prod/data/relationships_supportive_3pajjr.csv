"My (43M) daughter (22F) has started stealing to support her heroin addiction, and my wife (39F) wants to kick her out of the house",throwawayzlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3pajjr/my_43m_daughter_22f_has_started_stealing_to/,137,2416,"First of all, thank you to everyone who responded to my [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ccaf3/my_43m_daughter_22f_has_started_stealing_to/), harsh words or otherwise. I truly needed them, as I was completely blind to the pain that I was causing my family. I am truly sorry for disregarding the pain of my family. 

After making this thread and seeing the responses, I talked to my wife and son while my daughter was away, and I apologized for making excuses for her and not acknowledging how much I hurt them. We all cried for a long time and aired out a lot of feelings, and I was forgiven. Then, we all agreed to have a family intervention for our daughter. The deal was that she either goes to treatment or she doesn't get to stay in the home. My daughter was oddly unemotional during the meeting despite our pleas and crying, but she agreed to go to another treatment center about 200 miles away from home. We expected her to return today. 

But our lives changed about 40 days after we dropped her off. We received a call from the police department near the treatment center, and they told us that a young woman was found hanging in a motel that morning. She left a note with her name, me and my wife's names, my phone number, and something along the lines of ""I'm sorry for everything, Mom & Dad & [Brother], but I will never be better. Good bye."" 

She was finally cremated last month, and we spread her ashes over the park we used to play in. I miss her every day, even though the last few years made us fucking miserable. The other 20 years (I adopted her when she was 2) were amazing, and those are the years I choose to remember. I remember her infectious smile and intelligence and how she could make me melt  without even trying. We all separately admitted to choosing to remember her this way, and not in the way she ultimately ended up. 

We're all in counseling, both family counseling and one-on-one. Each of us go there 3 days per week, and we are becoming stronger as a family day by day. But there is still a gaping hole in my heart that I'm not sure will ever close. 

**tldr: my child committed suicide after leaving treatment early. we're devastated.**"
