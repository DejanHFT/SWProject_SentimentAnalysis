> Critics consensus: Beau Is Afraid is overstuffed to the point of erasing the line between self-flagellation and self-indulgence, but Ari Aster's bravura and Joaquin Phoenix's sheer commitment give this neurotic odyssey undeniable power.

[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/beau-is-afraid): 70/100 (21 critics)

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** 

> Three hours that definitely put the odd in odyssey, Beau Is Afraid could be said to suffer from the same bloat, wandering through bizarre detours of varying effectiveness before arriving at a wonderfully overripe operatic climax elevated by Patti LuPone as the Lydia Tár of single mothers. But even if its pacing is uneven, this is a movie of undeniably impressive big swings.

-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/beau-is-afraid-review-joaquin-phoenix-ari-aster-1235369262/)

> A sickly picaresque guilt trip that stretches a single Jewish man’s swollen neuroses into a three-hour nightmare so queasy and personal that sitting through it feels like being a guest at your own bris (in a fun way!), Ari Aster’s seriocomic “Beau Is Afraid” may not fit the horror mold as neatly as his “Hereditary” or “Midsommar,” but this unmoored epic about a zeta male’s journey to reunite with his overbearing mother eventually stiffens into what might be the most terrifying film he’s made so far.

> With its indulgent three-hour running time and telling no-festival release strategy, the A24 darling's latest reflects what happens when a technically gifted artist is given too much creative freedom.

-[Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/beau-is-afraid-review-joaquin-phoenix-ari-aster-1235577518/)

> Beau Is Afraid never stops ticking, even when it takes lengthy detours into imaginative fantasies of love and happiness just outside Beau’s reach before snapping back like a rubber band to its strange un-reality. Anchored by Joaquin Phoenix’s absurdist performance as a paranoid man making his way home to see his mother, it escalates in both physical scale and overlapping allusions that soon loop back on themselves, as if it were slyly deconstructing its own storytelling language. These eventually build to an overt and obvious yet wholly focused metaphor for how creating cinema is an act of vulnerability, one with little upside except exposing the most fearful and shameful corners of oneself, for all the world to see. In that vein, it’s the kind of movie worth recommending for its ambition alone, merely to witness the audacious result of anxious self-loathing writ large across the silver screen, without an ounce of restraint. That it’s also a remarkably well-crafted horror-comedy is a cherry on top.

-[Siddhant Adlakha, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/beau-is-afraid-review): 9.0 ""amazing""

> The film’s writer/director is Ari Aster, who has always been a funny guy. His excellent, trauma-filled dramas “Hereditary” and “Midsommar” may be packed with the horror of relationships, but it’s the cruel joke underneath that provides their driving force–they are pitch-black comedies about the universal fear of losing free-will, of being screwed from the get-go. “Beau Is Afraid,” an enveloping fantasy laced with mommy issues, is about being doomed from birth. It's Aster’s funniest movie yet. 

-[Nick Allen, RogerEbert.com](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/beau-is-afraid-movie-review-2023): 3.5/4

> The reach of this avant-garde comic meltdown sometimes exceeds its grasp, but this is still a consistently jaw-dropping joyride through one man’s terrible, very bad, no good week. Where the hell does Ari Aster go next?

-[John Nugent, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/beau-is-afraid/): 4/5

> Like many an auteur filmmaker’s passion project, it’s a huge swing that doesn’t always fully connect, and one that undoubtedly peaks too soon. But at a time when safe-bet sequels, franchise extensions and movies built on brand recognition are more prevalent than ever, the fact that something so singular exists and succeeds on its own terms is something to be celebrated. 

-[Jordan Farley, Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/beau-is-afraid-review/): 4/5

> Admittedly, it’s all a bit much, an exercise in familial grief, inherited burdens and compressed feelings of guilt, but that excess is entirely the point of Aster’s longest and most ambitious film to date. It is that excess of a little “Truman Show,” a little Greek Mythology, a little Kafka and whole lot of Freud that hypnotizes and disarms you before his extravagance, while inexplicably inviting you to do it all over again.

-[Tomris Laffly, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/beau-is-afraid-review-ari-aster-joaquin-phoenix/)

> A remake of Aster’s 2011 short film Beau, Beau Is Afraid is like if a Woody Allen protagonist was the Griffin Dunne character in Martin Scorsese’s After Hours, and the plot of that movie was pumped with existentialist steroids. It’s a paranoid, sexually repressed, labyrinthine odyssey with a schlubby hero — a bit like Under the Silver Lake. And like After Hours, Beau Is Afraid similarly plays out like one really long joke. For his third and most ambitious film (I’m loath to conjure Magnolia comparisons), Aster leans all the way into the funny bone he was wont to exhibit in his seemingly ultra-austere first features, Hereditary and Midsommar. 

-[Brianna Zigler, Paste](https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/ari-aster/beau-is-afraid-review): 7.5

> Having given us two classic scary movies with Hereditary and Midsommar, film-maker Ari Aster now unfortunately beckons us down the rabbit hole for a giant and epically pointless odyssey of hipster non-horror. Running at over three hours, Beau Is Afraid is a colossal recovered memory of mock Oedipal agony which is scary, boring and sad in approximate proportions of 1 to 4 to 2. It’s a movie in which Aster has surrendered some of his own originality and distinction for an indulgent, derivative flourish that seems to pastiche Charlie Kaufman or Darren Aronofsky’s crazy Mother! or maybe even Richard Kelly’s much controverted Southland Tales.

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/11/beau-is-afraid-review-joaquin-phoenix-ari-aster): 2/5

> Beau Is Afraid is stylish all right — Aster can’t stay away from style. Groovy low-angle shots, dream sequences rendered in wacky point-of-view perspectives, dreamlike vistas of dark water shot in glimmering light: Aster borrows from the best (Martin Scorsese, Ingmar Bergman) and the worst (Gaspar Noé) in this belabored work of slapstick agony. It’s the most magnificent act of oversharing you’ll see all year, a banquet of all the TMI you can eat, just for the price of a ticket. Though when you think about it, shouldn’t Aster be paying *us*?

-[Stephanie Zacharek, TIME](https://time.com/6270297/beau-is-afraid-review/)

> Ari Aster’s Beau Is Afraid, an insufferable three-hour slog that would make Terry Gilliam say “reel it in a bit, would ya?” It is juvenile and pointless, loud and abrasive, and not anywhere as clever as it thinks it is. There are, however, individual moments sprinkled throughout that genuinely hum with greatness.

-[Jordan Hoffman, The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/beau-is-afraid-film-review-joaquin-phoenix-1850309546): C+

> It’s reminiscent, in a way, of Southland Tales, Richard Kelly’s sweepingly bizarre follow-up to Donnie Darko, which drew deafening boos at its disastrous Cannes premiere in 2006. But Kelly's film (which is now enjoying something of a cult revival) always felt like it had been made with the best of intentions: it was an ambitious but muddled big swing from a young auteur earnestly running with his newfound creative freedom. Beau is Afraid, on the other hand, seems like Aster sat down one day and said to himself: right, I’m going to make a Southland Tales.
