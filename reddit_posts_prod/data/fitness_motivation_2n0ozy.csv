Anyone have tips on motivation?,Soundwaveking,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2n0ozy/anyone_have_tips_on_motivation/,18,4,I am a 24 yr old ex high school football player. Back in high school  I was lifting weights daily and running. I loved it. but now I'm a manager in retail and I have gained easily 60 to 70 pounds. I use to be a lineman and I've always liked being the big guy but now I'm the fat guy. I just can't seem to get motivated or excited about exercise  anymore... I'm in a rut. Any tips?
