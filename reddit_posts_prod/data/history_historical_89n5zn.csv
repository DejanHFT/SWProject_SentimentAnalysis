Worst historical misconceptions perpetrated by Hollywood and the movie industry,Lonewolfe28,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/89n5zn/worst_historical_misconceptions_perpetrated_by/,396,483,"Howdy folks,

I'm a history enthusiast, and I've been researching and studying history, specifically Roman history, for several years now. And while I enjoy a good history-based movie every once in a while, I can't get over the fact that despite enormous fundings, starpower, and so-called research, Hollywood's rarely managed to respect and present history in light of reasons and facts. So this section is dedicated to basically ""rant"" about some of the absolutely horrible portrayals of history through the lens of the movie industry. So let's discuss and share our opinions!

*Note* I'm not writing this post to bash movies and TV shows which borrow or are based upon historical elements. I understand that movies are first and foremost, a form of entertainment. But I also believe entertainment can be educational as well when done right. HBO's Rome, for instance, is a prime example of a TV show, set in a historical context that is both entertaining and authentic (for the most part).

1/Armor can't protect you! - Yeah, the usual depiction of shiny yet useless armor getting easily punctured and pierced through like butter in virtually every movie these days (not just historical) if they feature a fighting scene. This is, of course, absolute nonsense. Armor can deflect and protect its wearers from lots of combat hazards like cuts, stabs and arrows. If it wasn't able to do the job it was supposed to do, people would've stopped donning it since the Classical Age. Another extreme irritation is the look and the materials of the armor. In The Eagle, the Romans were wearing lorica segmentata made of...leather! The whole leather armor thing is killing me! I understand it from an artistic stand point but for god sake! this is history! It's not fantasy. Leather armor, according to my knowledge, has never been proven to be used widely and effectively in combat. Most armor was made of either metallic materials (mails, plates, lemellar) or multi layers of tough and specially woven fabric (linothorax, gambeson). 

2/Big weapons are cool! - Obnoxiously large weapons wielded by equally obnoxiously large men, who are often shirtless to show off big guns. In reality, no matter how big you are, you can't wield such large weapons and run towards the enemies hoping to survive without any shred of armor. Hollywood's tendency to depict combat fitness found in soldiers and historical figures identical to physique of nowadays bodybuilders is also a source of frustration. My disappointment could be pretty much summed up with the first battle scene in Gladiator where the Romans used their pila as thrusting spears to ward off cave-dwelling barbarians. Wonder if all that sweet money spent in researching history actually ended up manufacturing those greaves and bracers the Roman legionnaries probably didn't bother to wear. Google Trajan's column Ridley!

3/Archers are snipers! - This is a quite dramatic one since a shot of volleys of arrows blackening the skies and obliterating armies of heavily-armored men is always gonna have a gratifying effect upon the audience. Unfortunately, archers and archery weren't employed in such way and their effectiveness was never to that degree depicted in movies. Some hilarious things about archery in movies are first, apparently, as a little kid or a woman, you can automatically pick up an bow and become a killing machine with very little training while in fact, real archery requires a massive amount of discipline and physical training in order to master. Second, bows apparently could be drawn and held like guns to intimidate your foes into doing whatever you want them to do. Third, it's a good idea to fire into the enemies while our guys have already engaged them. Four, arrows that easily pierce through armor. Five, fire arrows in an open battle. And six but not least, homing arrows that conveniently find their way to the eyes or small crevices on the armor of the opponents.

4/Primitive barbarians - this is mostly about swords-and-sandals flicks that feature Germanic or Celtic tribes. The depiction of these peoples are atonishingly embarassing and insulting. If you've watched Gladiator or Centurion, you know what I mean. Not only that their clothings were filthy, ragged, and very ancient. But also they seem to wear no armor at all, and their weapons are clubs, and pitchforks and bonehammers. In truth, barbarians were sophisticated in their culture, society, and technology even though they lacked the infrastructure and centralization seen in great civilizations like Rome or Greece. They also favored cleanliness and good-looking apperance. Their beard and hair were often tied and decorated with pins and ornaments. Their clothes were colorful, washed if possible, and their shields were painted with vibrant colors. Roman armor, weapons, and helmets were inspired by the designs of the barbarian peoples they fought for hundreds of years. 

5/Formation doesn't exist! - As soon as the battle begins, all formations in almost all movies break and turn into painfully telegraphed and choreographed melee one-on-one struggles. Or when they advanced under heavy missle fire, nobody bothered to raise their shields up or form a testudo or a shield wall. Worst of all, these trained soldiers never used their shields to their advantage. They like to flail their swords around like idiots and completely expose their flanks and rear to counter-attack and their shields serve as a resevered counterweight they always keep at their back.

6/Ancient and medieval peoples were filthy - this is an extension of my point from the barbarians. Peoples in the Ancient and Medieval worlds, just like the Modern world, liked orderly apperance and cleanliness. They wore clothes dyed with various bright colors. Buildings were white washed and decorated, especially the interior of castles and churches. Everybody strived not to be a clumsily-dressed and stinky swine since you'd be percieved better if you dressed to impress. The average citizen would bathe several times a day if he/she could. This was even more emphasized in the military. Roman soldiers were expected to maintain and polish his armor and weapons. Knights took pride in their expensive gears, armor, and appearances, as did many before and after them, so they would shine (usually their servants would do it for him) their armor to the absolute level of glossiness. Being a badly-dressed soldiers would warrant an ass-whip in today's military like it did 100 or 1000 years ago.

7/Removing or losing your helmets casually during the heat of battle - This one is easily justifiable from Hollywood's perspective since they want to put the hero front and center. Thus making him visible in a sea of generic dudes doing mock battles is vital visual information for the audience. However, it would be suicidal if one ran bare-head around with calvary and archers waiting to end him. There is a reason why helmets had such a wide variety of designs and sophistication in the past.

Those are some of my points. Still have plenty more but these would suffice. What are yours? I'm interested to hear.
