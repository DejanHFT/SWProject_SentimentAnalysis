"What songs or albums, in retrospect, sound like an obvious suicide note or cry for help?",hemlock_hangover,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/17taaiy/what_songs_or_albums_in_retrospect_sound_like_an/,403,372,"I'm listening to songs off of the first, last, and eponymous album by ""Purple Mountains"", which I found out about in the same wikipedia article about David Berman that also mentions his suicide in 2019.

Knowing that in advance of listening, it's feels like every song is almost spelling it out. Lyrics like ""And the end of all wanting,
is all I've been wanting"" and ""The dead know what they're doing when they leave this world behind"" and, straight up, ""All my happiness is gone"".

Just as obvious, there are plenty of deeply melancholy or even self-destructively hopeless songs/albums out there by artists who *didn't* end up killing themselves. And maybe it's really impossible to say one way or the other, especially right at the release of the music, but even well after the fact, regardless of how long that musician ended up living.

But also, a LOT of musicians have committed suicide over the years, and a lot of those musicians were clearly ""not in a good place"", and that was coming out in their music. Not to mention the even more numerous deaths from drugs or other self-destructive activity. Not intentional suicides, but, sometimes, seemingly, not that far from it.

I also tend to like depressed/depressing music, so maybe this is something that feels more common than it actually is? But there must be some other examples out there."
