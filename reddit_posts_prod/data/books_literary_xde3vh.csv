I had one last night where I had a really nice, long conversation with Douglas Adams (RIP). At the end, I asked him to write me a note I could take with me as a memento, anything he wanted, so he wrote a gibberish note that read something like ""adoobawahwebooboo"". 

The only other literary dream I've had was a couple years ago when I was reading a lot of Gothic/Romantic stuff. I was in a haunted castle with Mary & Percy Shelley and Lord Byron when Lord Byron was attacked and bitten by a vampire. It was a really visually interesting dream with great Gothic mood!"
