Just discovered 'eggs in a basket' - Wow! What are some other relatively simple yet tasty things to make?,curiousaboutcooking,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/arrj1/just_discovered_eggs_in_a_basket_wow_what_are/,52,28,"In the past, my favorite style of eggs was always scrambled. EGGS IN A BASKET HAS CHANGED ALL THAT! I enjoy cooking, but I don't have that much eggsperience, and prefer to stick with simple things. Can anyone recommend some very simple but great (perhaps not well-known, eggxotic) dishes? (despite the failed egg puns, I am not implying that I am limiting myself to eggs). 

**Update 1:** About to go to sleep - will be back tomorrow to respond to replies! "
