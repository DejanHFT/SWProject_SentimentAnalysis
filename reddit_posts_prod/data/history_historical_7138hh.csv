Favorite Historical Figure and Why,TheBasher365,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7138hh/favorite_historical_figure_and_why/,150,141,"Just curious.  Tell who your favorite historical figure is and give a brief explanation of why.  Reasons can range to what they did, how they did something, or something that happened to them.

Mine is Theodore Roosevelt because during the 1912 campaign, he was shot on his way to give a speech.  The bullet passed through his immense speech before getting lodged in his chest.  He then continued onward and told the crowd he had just been shot, showed everyone the wound, and stated, ""It takes more than that to kill a Bullmoose.""

Edit: When I say the bullet passed through his immense speech, I mean the over 50-page manuscript.

Edit 2:Also, forgot to mention it also passed through the metal eyeglass in his pocket as well."
