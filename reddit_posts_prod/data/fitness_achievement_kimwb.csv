Achieved a goal last night! ,chadholl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/kimwb/achieved_a_goal_last_night/,64,397,"In May of this year, I was a 37 year old father, who was so out of shape that I could barely walk up a flight of stairs (much less keep up with an active 8 year old daughter).  Last night, with 30 less pounds of fat weighing me down, I participated in my first 5k race. I can't explain the joy that overcame me when I heard my daughter cheering for me as I approached the finish line. She was happy to see her daddy compete. I was thrilled to know that I've greatly improved my chances of living to see her graduate and get married. "
