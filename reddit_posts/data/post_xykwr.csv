**TLDR: I traveled.  Reddit gave me things to do.  I did them**

Hey Reddit, I've had a crazy, crazy summer and have you guys to thank.  My travels brought me across the US and Canada, through rural Thailand, to Seoul and Sydney.  Over the last three months I have met hundreds of redditors and gone on some cool adventures.  Highlights include:

Originally I was planning on traveling through till the end of July but surprise tooth ache had me grounded early (turns out I need my wisdom teeth removed).  I've been home for the last week, catching up on sleep and getting organized for the upcoming school year (which starts next week).

I also [donated the money](http://i.imgur.com/DZhKK.jpg) I raised (via reddit) for filming costs since I managed to stay underbudget all trip (mainly by living off of the hospitality of redditors instead of staying in hostels).  

I'm interested in doing something similar next summer, but on a bigger scale/actually organized.  Something where you could vote on where to send me a on week to week basis.  In the mean time I'm going to work on turning the footage I took this summer into something (short documentary or music video or something).

I just wanted to thank everyone once again,

**EDIT: I'll be doing an AMA this Sunday starting at noon PST**
