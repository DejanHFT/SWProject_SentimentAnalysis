"Lets say I create a computer program that simulates thousands of interactions in an ecosystem, and AI emerges. How would I know that intelligence emerged? Would I notice some substantial change in the program?",Beaver_shrimp,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/10sipw/lets_say_i_create_a_computer_program_that/,1,1,"For example, say I created a simulation program, one that simulates a complex ecosystem. Suppose further that the simulation is based off of the interaction of *lots* of [intelligent agents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent), each representing and playing the role of an organism. If a form of artificial intelligence emerged through the interaction of the agents, would I even know it happened? Would I be able to recognize the fact that there is a form of artificial intelligence on my computer?

Would it make a difference if the agents had learning capabilities?"
