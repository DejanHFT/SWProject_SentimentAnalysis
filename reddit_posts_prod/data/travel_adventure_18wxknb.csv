Best Caribbean Island for Adventure?,occasional_reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18wxknb/best_caribbean_island_for_adventure/,3,1,"I travel and hike lot, but mainly to mountain locations and not beaches. I am working on planning a trip for probably 30 people (large 40th birthday thing) to somewhere in the Caribbean. It's so impossible to narrow down the list! Everything looks amazing. 

We are looking for beautiful beaches, cool hiking opportunities, fun adventures/activities (snorkeling, water, etc) - and somewhere that has a lot of great authentic local culture and is not touristy. At the same time, I recognize with a lot of people, we will need somewhere that has large accommodation options. 

Would love to hear thoughts!

So far I have St Kitts/Nevis, PR, T&C, Virgin Islands, St Barts, Dominica, and the Bahamas, though I am hesitant to keep Bahamas on the list based on how touristy it seems. 

(I have read through a lot of the other Caribbean threads as well)"
