"Personal Achievement, Little Advice?",Da_Mallow_Man,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/tk2hi/personal_achievement_little_advice/,23,20,"I'm a 20 year old male. This time last year, I was 320+lbs. I had made the personal decision to lose the weight by whatever means possible. Naturally, the first step of the journey was to change my eating habits.

I've always been the person who would eat twice a day, both big meals, and be lazy unless I worked. To start changing my habits, I ate less at one sitting, and ate three, four, maybe five times a day. I didn't get more active or anything, but it started helping.

I noticed I was down about 30 pounds, setting me at 290. HUGE boost in ego and in confidence. I followed that strict diet plan for a long time, and eventually met my last girlfriend because of it. 

Then I hit my wall, as I'm sure a lot of people do. Broke up with the lady, went through frustrations at work, and started gaining weight. 

I got approved for a transfer to a different location with the company doing a more active job, and then I bought a mountain bike. That was in January. 

From January on, I have dropped soda almost entirely out of my diet, added loads of protein, and drink water when relaxing. If I need a caffeine boost, I'll make a cup of tea. I bike to work, which a round trip is 8.5 miles. On my weekends I will spend a part of my day riding my bike. I hit between 18 and 22 miles a day when I'm not working.

To supplement my workout, and build muscle, I've added a powder mix called Super Advanced NOS Blast to my diet by mixing it with orange juice and drinking it before and during my workouts. I use protein to feed my muscles and as a meal replacement when I'm not hungry, but need something to keep my nutrition up. 

I'm down 100 pounds. I've never felt better, but I still have more I want to do.

I'm told that I want to ""sculpt"" now. There's a bit of flab overhang left on my belly that I want to get rid of, and I haven't any clue how to do that. Sit ups haven't helped, running and biking have done all I expect they will be able to do, and I can't seem to find a way to get rid of that last little bit. 

If you guys, and gals, have any advice on how to knock off a few more pounds and get rid of that flab, that'd be much appreciated. I'm almost at my goal of being muscular and big, but not fat. 

Thanks for the advice guys! "
