"What can a 21 year old do now, that will help later in life?",kezdawg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ndbx1/what_can_a_21_year_old_do_now_that_will_help/,3087,1970,"After recently reading a thread about what individuals in the $500k+ a year salary worry about, it seems aparent that some people have well and truly sorted out what they are doing with the life they have been dealt. What can I, as a 21 year old, do to set myself to succeed at being able to provide for the family i hope I will have? What can I read to broaden my horizons? What should i do now that will give me the best opportunity to support and contribute to the lives of the family I will have one day? "
