What do you do when you are sick and not feeling well?,smartbycomparison,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1cqnfb/what_do_you_do_when_you_are_sick_and_not_feeling/,34,17,"I have been feeling pretty crummy this week.  I think I have some kind of head cold that is turning into a respiratory infection.  I don't want to go to the gym and risk getting others sick.  However, it is not like I have a lot of energy to work out anyways.  So what should I do about staying in shape?"
