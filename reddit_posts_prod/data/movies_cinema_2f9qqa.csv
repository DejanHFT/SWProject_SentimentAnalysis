100 Years Of Yearly Cinema,optixyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2f9qqa/100_years_of_yearly_cinema/,307,416,"Okay guys, the day is finally here. The day that we all (or at least some of us) have been waiting for. Over the summer we have worked together to compile a list of /r/movies favorite movies from each year for 100 years of film. 

First off, I want to thank all the people who have participated in submitting movies and voting and also to those who put up with seeing a Yearly Cinema thread on the front page every single day. I didn't actually think we would make it this far but I am very glad we did. 

Secondly, I would like to say that you guys have not seen the last of Yearly Cinema either. I would like to continue with these threads for years to come. I have decided that at the end of January of each new year I will post the previous years Yearly Cinema. I have chosen this time to give people a longer chance to see the December movies or others they may have missed. So hopefully you guys are down for that idea because it would be fun to keep this going. 

Anyways, now is the time for the list. I have collected the top movie from every post that was made and complied them in a list from 1914-2013. In brackets beside those movies you will see the 1st and 2nd runner-ups for that year as well. Finally, at the bottom I have made a list of the Top 10 Directors that had the most top movies in the list. Thank you all again and I hope you guys enjoy.
