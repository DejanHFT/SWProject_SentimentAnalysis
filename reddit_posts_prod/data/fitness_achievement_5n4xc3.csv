"Reached my 2016 goals! Are my 2017 reasonable, if so, how do i best achieve them! Help me /r/fitness :)",Bektus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5n4xc3/reached_my_2016_goals_are_my_2017_reasonable_if/,62,132,"Male, soon 25yo, 1.9m, 112kg (im not fat im fluffy)(FINE i could stand to lose a few kg..)

Just before new years i managed to hit 120/150/180kg for my BP/SQ/DL (although the form on the deadlift was not superb..). My aim for 2017 is to hit 140/180/220kg, is this reasonable? A few weeks back i also managed to do 1rm of 70kg on the OHP, is it possible to hit 100kg towards the end of the year?
