How can I (30F) be more supportive to my boyfriend (30M)?,Cool-Association5584,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mi0j4z/how_can_i_30f_be_more_supportive_to_my_boyfriend/,12,8,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2 years. Overall I feel really happy with him and I think we have a great relationship. One of my favorite things about him is that he is extremely supportive and does a great job of cheering me up when I'm down. 

The problem is that I don't think this goes both ways. Sometimes issues come up in his life and I have trouble being supportive. I feel like he sometimes leans into the negativity and gets kind of dramatic. For instance he had a health scare and he assumed the worst and went into a deep spiral about it. He was convinced he would have to give up all of his fitness hobbies and it would be devastating to his life. It ended up being literally nothing, which I kind of expected.

I don't know how to respond when he is having spirals like that. I think probably for the sake of the relationship he needs me to be empathetic but it's hard when I think he is seriously overreacting. I don't think anyone eve hears ""you've overreacting"" and then is like ""yeah actually I am, I'll stop that now!"" 

What is the best way for me to respond when I think he is being dramatic and making a mountain out of a molehill? Also he is in therapy right now but it's one of those online services so it's not super intensive or anything. Also he hates it when I'm like ""hmm maybe you could talk to your therapist about that,"" he thinks it's condescending.

tl;dr: How can I respond in a healthy way when my boyfriend is overreacting to issues?"
