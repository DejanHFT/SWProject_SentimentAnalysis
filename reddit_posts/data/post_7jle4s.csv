Why doesn't every chess game that Google's AI alpha zero plays against itself end up in a stalemate?,tobortidder,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7jle4s/why_doesnt_every_chess_game_that_googles_ai_alpha/,19,13,"From what I've heard Google's AI alpha zero has a training period, where it plays against itself to become better.At those games specifically how come that even though its opponent has the same knowledge and same resources the game doesn't always end up in a stalemate?

Thanks in advance!"
