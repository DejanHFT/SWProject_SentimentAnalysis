I have an interview for Creative Lead today... help!,Kevinincolour,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/po1ahb/i_have_an_interview_for_creative_lead_today_help/,1,0,"So, backstory, I've worked in marketing/business development for about 10 years, but recently in the last few years, I've started to shift my focus towards the creative/design side of the industry as it's where I seem to be naturally drawn (pun intended). I've done a decent amount of freelance creative & design work in the few years since I've shifted my focus, everything from advertising videos, a little bit of animation, digital art, web design, billboard design, etc and I think I'm decent but I also know there are a lot of people wayyy better than me with way more professional experience lol

But I landed an interview for Creative Lead for a small local marketing agency (about 50 employees) and I'm insanely excited because it's my dream position, but I'm honestly shocked I even got the interview and I have no idea how to go about this lol. I've never done an interview for a Creative position before, let alone a creative LEAD position. I'm entirely self-taught and all I have is freelance work.

Any advice you guys can give me? I do think I'm the right person for the position, but I need to figure out how to demonstrate that with my limited experience and stuff... Help lol"
