G Adventures: Feedback for Canadian tours?,These_Yak_1651,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/12d7kbg/g_adventures_feedback_for_canadian_tours/,7,1,"Have you gone on any of the Canadian tours with G Adventures? I'm looking at the ones that are ""Physical Grading: Demanding"" since those look like the most adventurous. I'd love to hear your feedback! It's tough to find actual reviews for their trips."
