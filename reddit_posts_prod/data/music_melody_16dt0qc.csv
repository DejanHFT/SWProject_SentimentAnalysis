Can you easily get a melody for a song based on its chords?,DogeLord081,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/16dt0qc/can_you_easily_get_a_melody_for_a_song_based_on/,2,0,"Hi, I'm a flutist and I love EDM, especially happy hardcore and nightcore but there's much sheet music for those genres, however, i can just look up the chords for pretty much any song and theyre on like guitar chords or chordify websites. I don't know much about music theory but I was wondering if chords and melodies are connected so that I can look at the chords of a song and kind of form a melody in my head and play it, as I unfortunately don't have perfect pitch. Thanks"
