What is your all-time favorite betrayal in cinema?,Hipi07,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/zqwqwf/what_is_your_alltime_favorite_betrayal_in_cinema/,668,678,"Personally, I think I have to go with Order 66 in Star Wars. It was portrayed beautifully in Revenge of the Sith with absolutely jaw dropping visuals and music, and the majority of media that shows and expands upon it (Clone Wars, Fallen Order...) only improves it by giving different angles upon which to view this cataclysmic and era defining event that literally changed an entire galaxy. An absolutely masterful plan all around that was decades in the making. IMO, there is nothing that comes close to changing a millennia old galactic status quo with literally 3 words.

What would you say is your favorite betrayal put on film?"
