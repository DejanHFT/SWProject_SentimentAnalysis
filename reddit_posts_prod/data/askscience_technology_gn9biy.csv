"AskScience AMA Series: We're from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and we research the blue economy: the sustainable use of the ocean and connected waterways for collective economic, social, and environmental benefits. Ask Us Anything!",AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/gn9biy/askscience_ama_series_were_from_the_pacific/,280,3435,"Within the next decade, the blue economy could generate $3 trillion in revenue for the global economy. At PNNL, we are applying our marine research and unique facilities to accelerate growth in the blue economy and are finding opportunities for innovative energy technologies such as wave, tidal, and offshore wind energy. [Coastal scientists](https://www.pnnl.gov/coastal-science) at the [Marine Sciences Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/marine-sciences-laboratory) (MSL) in Sequim, Washington have expertise in key marine development areas, including marine renewable energy, environmental monitoring, biofuels from sustainable feedstocks, and hydrogen fuel production from the ocean.

We're excited to share how science and technology are advancing the future of the blue economy. We'll meet you back here at noon PST (3 ET, 19 UT) to answer your questions!
