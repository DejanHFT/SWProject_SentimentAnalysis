"Songs/artists with ""My life is a mess. I fucked up badly. But I'm still gonna enjoy myself"" attitude?",fixxxer2606,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/17p1zqk/songsartists_with_my_life_is_a_mess_i_fucked_up/,401,235,"I've been listening to a lot of Faith No More lately and realized that they don't have that naive ""Everything's great"" attitude but their music sounds so uplifting and optimistic most of the time. Some other examples I can think of rn:

Sky Might Fall by Kid Cudi

That's Life by 88-Keys, Mac Miller & Sia

While these people acknowledge their issues, they don't catastrophize them and they're like ""Fuck it, we ball."" Hope it makes sense."
