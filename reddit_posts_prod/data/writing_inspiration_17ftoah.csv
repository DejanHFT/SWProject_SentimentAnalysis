I’m looking for modern heroine inspiration for my story. Having difficulty finding this character.,ErikReichenbach,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/17ftoah/im_looking_for_modern_heroine_inspiration_for_my/,4,3,"As stated, I have a strong willed heroine as a central figure in my story, and I’m having trouble finding them fully. Specifically, how to “show don’t tell”, fully develop their motivations, and  what attributes to focus on. 

I’m looking for any recommendations for other books with modern heroine figures to see how other authors have done this and get my own concept rolling. 

This is an action / adventure story and our character does not have a love interest, or at least a love interest that defines or effects her story. 

Thank you!"
