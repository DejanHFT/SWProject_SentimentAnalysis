Recurring tropes that often show up in historical games over and over without much historical basis.,Hingamblegoth,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/kvvaz9/recurring_tropes_that_often_show_up_in_historical/,45,15,"There seems to be some tropes that have repeatedly shown up in video-games with an historical setting. I am mostly thinking about strategy games like Age of empires or Civilization in particular. For some reason the tropes seem to become traditional in a way, showing up in games from various different developers without much basis in the original time period.

One good example is how whenever Samurai are present, often as a emblematic unit for a Japanese faction they are for some reason depicted as a common, heavy infantry soldier armed with a sword. Whereas in reality Samurai were nobility and fought as cavalry (they were the Japanese equivalent to feudal knights in Europe) and used bows or spears whereas their sword was a sidearm. This depiction is extremely widespread and has become somewhat of a predictable trope in RTS games like Age of empires, Rise of nations, Civilization, and Empire earth that all feature Samurai as common heavy sword infantry.

There are more tropes like these, one I can think of is in some games like Age of empires 2 and Rise of nations, ""Javelins beat archers"" is a game mechanic for some reason. Another is having stereotypical ""vikings"" in a high medieval period fighting knights (when the knights in essence where the successor and evolution of early medieval Germanic martial culture that is represented by the vikings).

What more tropes in games with an historical setting that have become almost like traditions are there? There ought to be many in games set in more modern periods too."
