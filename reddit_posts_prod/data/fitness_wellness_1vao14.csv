Diminishing returns of exercise on wellness (research),diminishingreturn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1vao14/diminishing_returns_of_exercise_on_wellness/,11,0,"What do I see when I visit the frontpage?

* People in pain during workouts
* People with muscle soreness throughout the week
* People with injuries
* People who ""feel bad about themselves"" if they miss a day of exercise

Seeing any problems with this?

My post here puts aside the massive, widespread issue of fat-shaming and fat-hatred prevalent throughout the fitness community (both amateur and professional; I won't touch that and I'm not talking about shaming on obesity). This puts aside exercise disorders. And this puts aside longterm health problems associated with weight-lifting and excessive exercise (I won't touch that).

The NYTimes reports that a regular session of 4 minutes of intense exercise has the same amount of positive effect on your longterm health (not fitness) as extensive cardiovascular training.

On the other hand, much of the discourse in fitness media circulates around ""getting the perfect bod"" and ""reaching for the most gains,"" two sentiments that are in direct opposition to what research shows about reaching basic optimal health. Are these biased sentiments overriding best practices and advice to newcomers to fitness?

What does /r/fitness think about this, and do you think that newbies to fitness and exercise-averse persons need to be approached differently about their goals and needs accordingly?"
