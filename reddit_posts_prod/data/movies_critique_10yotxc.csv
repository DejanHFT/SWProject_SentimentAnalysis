"TÁR (2022) was boring, cold and pretentious and Cate Blanchett was so artificial and theatrical as Lydia Tár that I wonder if people, who are raving about this, ever saw Ingmar Bergman or John Cassavetes.",Lili_Danube,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/10yotxc/tár_2022_was_boring_cold_and_pretentious_and_cate/,121,53,"It's like, there wasn't a single moment in TAR where I felt like Cate Blanchett immersed herself in her character, it just seemed hammy and fake. It seemed just like acting to me. Sure, Blanchett can do a good speech but that doesn't make it great acting. I didn't buy it for a second. I thought Nina Hoss and the actress who played her assistant were a lot more convincing. 

And it was Sooooooooo Boring. I mean, the endless monlogues, the pretentioness of it ll. I mean, how can you make a movie about a narcissistic, self-absorbed witch who destroys everyone around her and make it an absolute chore to go through? 

Todd Field's previous movies were good. The guy next to me was so bored, he began to sleep. I could literally hear him snore. 

If you want to watch something a whole lot better, I recommend OPENING NIGHT with Gena Rowlands and Joan Blondell. This had me wanting to scream."
