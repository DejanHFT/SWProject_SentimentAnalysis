Monocultures and the Psyche,AxisFlip,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/oz7k6/monocultures_and_the_psyche/,4,0,"For all the people going through psychological crises as I did (and for everybody else of course, but I think a sense of crisis is pretty universal in people): 


A saying goes ""as above so below"", but ""as outside so inside"" seems more to the point.

Take monocultures, one of my favourite topics to rage about. We go outside, see a pristine forest or some plain with an intricate ecological net of interrelated plants, animals, fungi and bacteria, and we decide to remove all that we do not want (which is pretty much all of it), plow the earth, and plant *one* crop all over the place. The rectangular shape of most fields should give off the sentiment with which the whole thing is being done.

With this come a lot of problems. A monoculture says basically to insects (""pests"") that this is basically an all-you-can-eat, and so they do. Now we need insecticides. Then, plants that we do not want to grow in the crop need to be removed too, with herbicides, because otherwise they‘d use up the nurtrients that we want in our food, not in so-called weeds. Following this we have yet another problem: because of only planting one crop the soils start to lack nutrients, thus we need fertilizer. I have no real grasp of all the problems that arise with this, but it seems that there's a lot of problems. Soil acififies and erodes, fertilizer is being oxidized, becomes toxic in the process and gets into various bodies of water, causing eutrophication. Pesticides often are pretty toxic too, or at least not supportive for healthy ecosystems. To counter these problems we get into genetic engineering a lá monsanto, the dangers of which are way beyond my accurate understanding, but something tells me that it isn't going to work either...
So in order to have monocultures to produce **""goods""** we have to keep nature from its natural state by means of ever-growing force, which is wrecking our world. 

And so it is inside. We strive for some ideal state, whatever it may be, maize or wheat, happiness or love, it doesn't matter. The matter of fact is that we look inside, and we don't like what we are seeing. Fear, anger, pride, memories, resentment etc.pp. the whole deal. But we want to be **good**, otherwise we won't survive! So we try to pull these weeds and plant something good, disrupting the natural state of ourselves because it is not how we want it to be --> we are not harmonious anymore.
In the case of myself, I could see that when I felt sexually attracted to someone, the farmer inside myself said that it is a pest (whatever fool thaught me that) and used a pesticide against it: guilt. It works, the attraction is gone, but now guilt is there, and it is eroding the soils of the mind and body. You become quite dull, and the pressure will work up and the force you will have to exert to get rid of the „pest“ will grow and grow. The principle is being carried out with a whole range of emotions.


Before the neolithic transition (calling it a revolution is unfit for a process that took about 3000 years or so I‘ve been told) we were hunter-gatherers, which meant that we didn't have to manipulate nature in order to survive. Contemplate the psychological significance of this: We took the gifts that we got from nature, nature cared for us, we could put trust in it, hence the term „Mother Nature“. We inhabited a universe that nourished us. Many people think that it was a brutish and nasty life in which we barely survived, but as some studies show, nomads in the kalahari desert, one of the harshest inhabited climates, spend only 20 hours a week for subsistence. 

In contrast, when you become an agriculturist, you have to manipulate nature and keep the land by force from its natural state, in order to produce food for you to survive: you have to fight for survival, you are not being cared for if you don't work hard for it. A lot of insecurities arise with this: a summer might be very dry and the fields might dry out or some other disaster might happen that could be potentially deadly in the future. 
The world gets divided into two parts: good (fields) and bad (the wild). And so it comes that we have to *control the world in order to make it good* so that we may survive = we have to control ourselves to be good in order to survive, but all we do is to poison ourselves.


I hope this is coherent, my point is that we should learn to let nature back into ourselves again and stop pretending to be „normal“. Like a parking lot, if you just let it stand for some time, the cement will crack and plants will come out and bloom. Don't pave it over again, it is artificial and ugly. Let it grow within yourself! Let nature back in! Yes, many people still seem like parking lots,.. but they will crack open too. It is bound to happen, nature always reverts back to its harmonious state. Even if the process causes our psyche to break.

We have to go through crises to see that.. If it wasn't for global warming and eroding soils etc.etc. we wouldn't get into different modes of sustainable food production such as permaculture, and if it wasn't for personal crises we wouldn't get back into more natural states of being. 
The topic would need a whole book.. so much is connected with this artificiality. Another monoculture that downright destroys nature by trying to make everything the same is school. Kids are being schooled and graded, like potatoes. Those who are graded 5 drop out of the grid and are being processed in the factory, and have to fear for their lives (they will get less biosurvival tickets aka money), while the ones that are graded 1 get into higher positions/are being sold to sophisticated customers... It‘s one of the reasons I quit university, I have no patience for learning under pressure to achieve good marks.

Please excuse that this text is a bit black and white, I realize that there is a lot of gray in between, especially between hunter-gatherers and agriculturists. They are not so much steady discrete states but more so positions on a gradient. It would be beyond the scope of this text to go far into detail. "
