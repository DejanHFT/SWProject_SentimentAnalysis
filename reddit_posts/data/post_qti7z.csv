Machine neural networks and object recognition. ,cosmobaud,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/qti7z/machine_neural_networks_and_object_recognition/,0,0,"I keep being continually amazed at how apparently effortless object recognition is for humans and how difficult it is currently for AI.

For example look at a random photo like this

Most of us will have no problem identifying and categorizing the objects featured in the photo even though they have never seen those specific objects before.  

My thought our abilities comes from us ""assuming"" and generalizing objects very efficiently. 

For example when you look at the photo above I don't believe that we actually recognize the objects but assume from ""top down"" if you will what we're perceiving. 

For example if you look at a photo on this article

Our brain assumed one thing and then proceeded to make other assumptions about the scene based on that knowledge. 

I'm really curious about learning how we determine our assumption is good enough so we can move forward and how to we correct the assumption. "
