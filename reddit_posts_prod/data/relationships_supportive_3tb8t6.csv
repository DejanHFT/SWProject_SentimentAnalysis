UPDATE: Me [37M] with my wife [34F] of 13 years. She wants a divorce but can't financially support herself. We have two children.,jaggeristo,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3tb8t6/update_me_37m_with_my_wife_34f_of_13_years_she/,233,1108,"[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3say3i/me_37m_with_my_wife_34f_pf_13_years_she_wants_a/)

I have to admit, I wasn't expecting the Reddit response.  Apparently I have no balls and I'm letting my wife walk all over me.  Someone even recommended I check out the red pill.  Sorry, this experience doesn't invalidate the fact that I've been married to this woman for 13 years and that we have two children whose well being is always my top priority.  Do I want to be a good father? yes, but if my daughters' well being comes at the expense of damaging their relationship with their mother, the person who's always been there?  No.  I'd never do that.

What I did was seek a legal opinion.  A lot of you who have gone through something similar said I should go to a lawyer behind Aire's back, so I did.  Actually, it wasn't so much going behind anyone's back, but just a realization that this marriage will end in divorce no matter what, so I made an appointment. Our conversation is covered by attorney client privilege and I'm not going to detail it here, but suffice it to say that I will not be moving out of my home.  The problem is, neither is Aire.  She doesn't have to and as I explained on my last entry, she has nowhere to go.  We could sell the house and divide the sale money, but that's not an immediate solution.  

I went home after seeing the lawyer and told Aire what I had found out.  She wasn't angry that I'd seen a lawyer.  To the contrary, she seemed relieved that I finally got the message that our marriage is over.  I told her it's out of the question that I leave my home, and that she's free to go whenever she wants. She said she doesn't want to leave the children and that's not what she wants at all, but right now she has no degree and no job and no skills, if we're going to be honest with each other.  I told her I know I can't kick her out of the house, but that we're done being married.  From now on we're going to co-parent and have separate bedrooms.  That means that the girls are going to have to share a room for the time being, but we all have to start making tough changes around here.  In the meantime, she needs to find a job and we need to put the house up for sale.

Aire was shocked when I told her all this.  She started crying and talking about how the girls are going to be traumatized by having to share a room.  I told her the sooner she could move out the sooner the girls can go back to having their own bedroom.  She left last night and I had to get the girls ready for school this morning.  I am now at work and she hasn't answered any calls.

To be continued, I guess.
   
**tl;dr**: Lawyered up, told wife the new rules, wife freaked and dissapeared."
