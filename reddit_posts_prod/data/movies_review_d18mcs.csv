#**Reviews**

>*""A contemporary whodunnit that both respects and revises the subgenre. ... It’s such a rare pleasure to see a director so in love with a genre without slipping into Tarantinoesque fanboy indulgence, remembering his audience is bigger than himself and also that his film requires both head and heart.""*

[The Gaurdian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/08/knives-out-review-rian-johnson-crafts-a-devious-meta-whodunnit)

>*Knives Out is thematically rich, technically astounding, and superbly acted, it’s also just a complete and total blast of a movie. This is a film that’s designed to be enjoyed in a packed theater, surrounded by strangers sharing in the twists, turns, and hilarity that ensues. But it is striking that Knives Out is so effective at being a crowdpleaser in contrast to other studio blockbusters that cost at least twice as much and are only half as fun. This is an original story with no explosions, space ships, or aliens, just extremely talented actors in rooms spouting words written by one guy. And yet it’s one of the most purely satisfying and enjoyable moviegoing experiences I’ve had in recent memory.*

>*""Knives Out recalls a time when audiences could still be surprised by such mysteries, before the genre devolved into a corny parody of itself. Johnson keeps us guessing, which is good, but the thing that makes this a better mousetrap than most isn’t the complexity, but the fact he’s managed to rig it without the usual cheese.""*

[Variety](https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/knives-out-review-1203327504/)

>*""A crackling, devious, and hugely satisfying old-school whodunnit with a modern twist ... Even if you do somehow manage to piece the whole thing together in advance, there’s no way of predicting the joy of watching it all unfold. ""*

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/09/knives-out-review-rian-johnson-1202171812/)

>*""A delicious throwback to the all-star whodunit, this juicy comedy thriller is a treat from start to finish.""*

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/knives-out-tiff-2019-1237825)

>*""This thriller can sometimes be too mechanical — a breezy exercise if not always an emotionally satisfying one — and yet the large cast’s willingness to get on Johnson’s brainy, sprightly wavelength makes this an enjoyable romp.""*

>*The game’s afoot and everyone’s a suspect in Knives Out, Rian Johnson‘s deliriously funny whodunit. It’s the most fun you’ll ever have trying to solve a murder. Gathering together a killer cast of movie stars and character actors, Johnson has crafted a film that’s both a loving homage to locked room mysteries and a giddy, laugh-out-loud funny comedy that keeps pulling the rug out from under you just when you think you’ve found your footing. It’s a total blast.*

>*Murder, Mayhem, Mystery with outrageously quippy dialogue from Rian Johnson makes Knives Out the most fun movie-going experience I've had in ages. A sure throwback to Christie, Clue and Hitchcock in the best way possible.*
