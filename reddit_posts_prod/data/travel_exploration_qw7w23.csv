Relatively cheap suggestions on extended vacation/exploration destinations?,UltimateLurkster,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/qw7w23/relatively_cheap_suggestions_on_extended/,4,2,"Turning 30 soon and want to just kinda get away from real life for a few months. Life is great, career taking off, making more money than I ever have but just want to go on a 4 to 8 month hiatus from this life and go exploring/vacation somewhere nice. Leaning towards tropical but I’d be open for suggestions in Europe as well. I’m American, single, and looking to spend between $10,000-$20,000, which is pretty much my life savings but with job trajectory plus solid backup plans am happy to spend it on something like this. I speak only English, willing to study a bit though. Before my current career I served tables and bartended so I’d be willing to do something like that a bit to sustain if needed. 

Picture perfect what I have in my head is a cabana close to a tropical beach being lazy some days, exploring some days, bartending some nights. Or hopping destination to destination through Europe taking in a different culture and seeing a variety of areas."
