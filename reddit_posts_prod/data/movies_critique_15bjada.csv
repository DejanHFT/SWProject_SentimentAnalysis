Funny Games (1997) or Funny Games (2007)?,erzastrawberry101,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/15bjada/funny_games_1997_or_funny_games_2007/,14,5,"I  see a lot of sentiment that the Funny Games remake is one of those  unnecessary American remakes. The IMDB, Letterboxd, and Rotten Tomato  scores of the 2007 remake are lower than the 1997 original. I usually  dislike remakes that are solely riding on the popularity of the original  film; I think Funny Games U.S. is one of the rare cases where this is  not the case

I prefer the American remake for the following reasons:

1. The American setting is more suitable for the commentary that the film is going for. Michael Haneke himself [stated](https://web.archive.org/web/20131002065215/http://www.cineaste.com/articles/funny-games.htm)  that Funny Games was originally intended to be an American film. Since  this film is a critique of slasher films, it makes sense that the  setting it's critiquing would be a conventional (and cliche) American  setting.
2. One  cannot say that the cinematography, script, set design, music, etc. are  inferior to the original because it is practically the same  shot-for-shot remake of the original. This point is more closer to  stating that the remake is equal to the original (in these elements)  rather than being superior or inferior.
3. I prefer the acting in the remake (particularly the child and Paul). I found the American child actor to be better. [Especially in this scene](https://youtu.be/gvWW0dajKl0?t=3464), compared to the [original version](https://youtu.be/ozSeJnvkGEQ?t=3585).  Although both the Pauls give the rich douchebag vibe, I (personally)  prefer the remake's actor. For some reason, I would feel more unsafe  around the American guy.

I would love to hear others' opinions. I especially am curious about what aspect the original does better than the remake."
