"School of Economics focused on Optimizing for ""Innovation Conditions""?",Wise-Function653,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/117ezl3/school_of_economics_focused_on_optimizing_for/,1,9,"It seems to me that the winners of the future will try guarantee the majority of their population is living in conditions in which they can participate in driving the innovation we care about as a society - things that improve health, expand knowledge, or increase safety.

From what we know about the effects of poverty, this would require guaranteed survival (housing, food, energy, transport, etc.) and big investments in education. Maslow logic applied as a school of economics. 

I've seen these arguments made re morality and outcomes (socialism), but. not necessarily to optimize for private sector innovation and national strength. Considering how deeply embedded neoliberalism is (and fear of communism), this seems like a narrative that's more likely to be embraced than the straight froward argument for socialism and could get us similar outcomes.

That said, I'm not  DEEP into alt economics, so wondering what is out there on this. Thanks!"
