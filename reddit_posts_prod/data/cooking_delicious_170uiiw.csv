"Spicy, oily, delicious, Mexican chicken soup",Findpolaris,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/170uiiw/spicy_oily_delicious_mexican_chicken_soup/,0,2,"Requesting your abuelitas’ recipes! There’s this chicken soup I get from a Mexican spot near my house. It’s broth based, adorned with a thick layer of lovely, aromatic, fire-engine red oil floating on top. Bone-in chicken with chunks of carrot and potato tumble around in the bottom. A stray piece of spinach in there too. Does this sound familiar? Please and thank you!"
