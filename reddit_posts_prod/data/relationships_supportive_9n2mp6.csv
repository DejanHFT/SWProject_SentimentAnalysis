Long time friend (26F) is not supportive of me (26F) having kids,callmepebbles,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9n2mp6/long_time_friend_26f_is_not_supportive_of_me_26f/,11,1,"Kassie and I have been best friends since basically kindergarten. She's never liked kids and I've known that. My husband and I are trying to conceive and I'm worried about our friendship when I have kids. I've talked to her about my concerns. She said she just hopes I won't bring the kid around her so we can still hang out. I've asked her (almost jokingly but also testing the waters) if she could at least appease me and when I have kids continue to ask how I am and not *immediately* lose interest when I talk about my kids. She seemed a little insulted I even asked for her to even pretend to show an interest. I'm struggling because I don't know if I can be friends with someone knowing that when I have kids it will be a very important part of my life, and I won't even be able to talk to her about it. Me and her have very separate views on a lot of things. I'm catholic and she would have no problem ""getting a $200 procedure done"" if she were to accidentally get pregnant. She's sleeping with a married man right now from work. I don't shove my views in her face and always listen when she talks to me about things I may not agree with and plat the very least pretend to have an interest because I worry about her and the choices she makes. Do you think I might end up having to call it quits on this long standing friendship? And am I a bad person for thinking that?

TLDR; My friend absolutely despises kids, me and my husband are trying to conceive. I'm afraid this will damage our friendship irreparably. "
