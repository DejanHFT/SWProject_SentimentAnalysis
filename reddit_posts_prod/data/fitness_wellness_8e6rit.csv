Eating well under the recommended calories daily?,DisneyMadeMeDoIt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8e6rit/eating_well_under_the_recommended_calories_daily/,24,10,"I'm a low activity office worker trying to shed a few extra pounds and improve my overall health.

Only a week in of counting and eating healthy with a goal of 1,750 daily, but I've noticed my average per day is only ~1,300.

How bad is this?

Should I work in a few more snacks to get myself around my goal?"
