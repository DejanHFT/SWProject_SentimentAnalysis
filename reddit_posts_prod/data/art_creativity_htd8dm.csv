What does it mean to be creative?,DumbTerminaI,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/htd8dm/what_does_it_mean_to_be_creative/,4,5,"I came to this subreddit because I thought I'd get the most helpful responses here.

Recently I observed that I could only be creative in a certain way. My way of being 'creative' is that I take two known concepts and merge them. An example: When I try to write, my writing just seems to be merging different situations and characters of the many books I've already read.

I'm having trouble with being truly creative, coming up with original ideas. It truly escapes my imagination how someone could come up with new ideas.
All I am able to do is take known things and make something better out of it. How do you get to the point where you create your own stuff?"
