What band do you feel like more people should know about?,Manbous,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/xhom7q/what_band_do_you_feel_like_more_people_should/,4010,2468,"

For me, it's Thrice. I feel like the complex rhythms and haunting/soaring melodies go so well with the heaviness inspired by their early stuff.
They started out as punk/metal, with raw energy oozing out of every song, while still being melodic and very well written.
Then they slowly transformed their sound into what is now a unique style. 
I've never seen them live, but if I had to choose one band to see, they would be the one, by far.

Edit: I'm gonna have a LOT of listening to do... You guys are awesome!"
