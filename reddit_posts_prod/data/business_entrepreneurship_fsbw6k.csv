Are entrepreneurship programs worth purchasing?,Clikkks,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/fsbw6k/are_entrepreneurship_programs_worth_purchasing/,5,2,"Hi, I am 19 as of now and I honestly HATE having someone tell me what to do. I want to own my own business one day but I don't know where to start to be honest. Are programs like [jefflernerstraining](https://jefflernerstraining.com/) or ones alike worth purchasing or are they scams?"
