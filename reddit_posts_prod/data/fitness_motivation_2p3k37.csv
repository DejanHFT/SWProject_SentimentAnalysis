Help! I lost my motivation,Thesushilife,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2p3k37/help_i_lost_my_motivation/,29,2,"I have been an avid fitness person all my life and now i've lost my motivation. I try and force myself to the gym and when I get there I'm not excited. I used to get excited when i feel the pump during a workout but now its not that appealing. 

How do I get my motivation back...
I know the benefits, I want to get back on it, I just don't want to. Has anyone else felt this way? How did you over come it?"
