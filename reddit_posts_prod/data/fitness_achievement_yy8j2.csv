Yes, I know it sounds like the dumbest lamest shit ever. But for real I would watch the show and think, ""how the fuck did those dummies get such wicked bodies??"" 
Not sure about anyone else, but for me, I really can't stand someone dumber than me being more fit...it's just...bothersome lol. 
So I started weight training with a goal - to get a six pack. It sounds lame but it worked! 
Beyond that it ended up changing my life...I'm completely in love with weight training now and it's a huge part of my life. I feel great, I'm way more confident, and I seem to meet women everywhere I go...it's awesome. 
So thanks Jersey Shore, you may not have done much for society, but you definitely motivated me to get into shape!

**EDIT** Sorry for the initial lack of info on my routine. Really didn't think I'd get this much feedback! Have to say I just laughed my ass off reading some of your witty comments. Bravo.

The routine I used was actually based off of something I read on simplyshredded.com - if you havent been to this site, GO THERE, it seriously changed my life. Soo much useful info. Kind of a wierd routine but it worked.

When I started I was about 175 lbs. So I lost 15 pounds but I leaned out. I'm 24 years old.

Wednesday - Kickboxing

Then Thursday would be the same as monday, and Friday the same as tuesday. So I would hit each muscle group twice a week.

Diet - I was strict. For 6 months. That shit was hard. Really hard. I like to eat anything and everything. But i basically stayed away from bread, and any carb that was white unless it was right before or after a workout. I would wake up with either oatmeal and fruit, or a protien shake with fruit. Workout, then have a protien shake again. Then eggs and veggies and brown rice. Then more protien shakes and cottage cheese. For cheat days I'd have sushi.

Hope that answers some questions. Oh and also, yeah my backyard is pretty sweet, but I only workout back there in the summer time :)

**EDIT** I should add that I play the drums too, which doesnt build muscle but burns a lot of calories. Its what I do for a living so I'm at the drumset like 30+ hours a week. Here's a video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_PaUDO8VTo&feature=g-all-u
