Information, Rationality, and the Self-regulation of Welfare

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that:
1) the soft variety of paternalism is most consistent with liberty; and 
2) that the relevant probabilistic risks of a particular behavior ought be examined by experts, their conclusions about what constitutes sufficient knowledge should then be the standard that agents must meet; and lastly,
3) expert standards ought reflect the seriousness of the probabilistic harm.

Introduction:

Philosophers refer to a general lack of infringement on one’s autonomy as negative liberty. All paternalistic practices in some way infringe upon liberty, by an appeal to well-being. Negative liberty is undoubtedly reduced by soft paternalistic practices but for a different reason than in cases of traditional paternalism. Requiring that agents be informed about inherent risks improves well-being in a less intrusive way than absolute requirements and prohibitions. It also preserves liberty in the sense that agents still have a route to the satisfaction of their desires, although the actualization of such desires may be impeded by extensive education. Requiring agents to ‘jump through’ educational ‘hoops’ is indeed an infringement on liberty/freedom/autonomy. But if compared to other methods of well-being regulation, requiring that agents be informed is a rational and relatively un-intrusive strategy. Furthermore, negative liberty would in a potential sense be preserved within a system of soft paternalism despite its reduction in a traditional sense.

Most cases that shall be considered fit into two broad categories: access to substances and freedom to participate in activities. Prospective agents in all cases ought have some rudimentary understanding of the associated risks. Depending upon the seriousness of the risk, education in an informational sense may not be adequate. In highly serious cases, a demonstration of competency or test may be required; in more innocuous cases a fundamental understanding of risk may be gained by simply reading or watching some material. Cases regarding health require reassessment from time to time, as physical condition tends to change. The scope of authority that experts ought have to infringe upon the agency of others will not be argued here in a definitive way. Rather, real world examples will illustrate varying degrees of discretionary power that are currently employed by experts. I am merely suggesting a paternalistic strategy that both increases welfare and preserves potential liberty. 


Objectives:

The primary goal of paternalism is to maximize well-being among sets of people who need protection in some way. Negative liberty for those not needing protection must also be considered, so we must attempt to at least preserve the potential of actualizing our desires, which traditional paternalism makes no attempt to do. So my primary goal is to suggest that education is the route to ensuring that agents who engage in risky behavior ought at least be made conscious of the relevant risks. Its viability as a relevant alternative to traditional paternalism gives us a means to restore negative liberty in the potential sense. The secondary benefit of soft paternalism is that agents are given information that can cause reconsiderations of long-term ends. The process of being exposed to relevant probabilistic risks might then lead by =>=> to a reconsideration of short-term means. At such a point, paternal intervention and infringement would not be justified under my theory, nor would it be necessary because all agents could assess their own risky habitual behaviors in an informed way and thus make rational decisions about their own well-being.

Arguments:

The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) definition of paternalism is:

The interference of a State or individual with another person, against their will, defended or motivated by a claim that the person interfered with will be better off or protected from harm.

This broad definition is a useful starting point because it captures the essence of nearly all flavors of paternalism. Broken into premises it is the argument that:

P1) Law or action X interferes with the autonomy or liberty of S.
P2) G does X without the consent of S.
P3) G does so only because G believes X will increase S’s welfare (this includes preventing his welfare from diminishing) or in some way promote the interests, values or good of S.

All forms of paternalism contain premises which resemble P1) &amp; P2).  

Together P1) &amp; P2) broadly mean that S’s possibilities for future action have just changed in at least one way -whatever is the subject and content of X. More specifically, in each case of X, S’s total negative liberty decreases because there is now at least one “obstacle, barrier, or constraint,” which concerns him (SEP). 

G could be anyone or perhaps any organization. G functions as an authority, whether a lifeguard, a political institution or an expert who controls access in some way.

S is rarely a single person. Most of the time S is a set of people with common interests.

P3) justifies this loss of liberty by way of G’s interest in S’s welfare, including protecting his welfare from diminishing. 

Notice that the power G has in the traditional conception above is relatively unlimited and grants no consideration for S’s self-interested opinion on X. Also, consider that G must merely believe it will increase welfare, or in some way promote the interests, values or good of S. 

Soft paternalism is:

The interference of individuals or States, against the will of an agent, is only justified to ensure that the agent is acting both knowledgeably and willfully.

P1) Law or action X interferes with the autonomy or liberty of S.
P2) G does X without the consent of S.
P3) The interference of X is justified to ensure S is acting both knowledgeably and willfully.

Upon my interpretation, the knowledge condition applies anytime risk exists, knowledge in this sense refers to an understanding of the risks associated with the subject of X. Pertinent associated risks should be decided by the experts of a given field. The condition of willfulness is entangled with the knowledge condition. Full knowledge (or at least sufficient knowledge) of relevant risks, is necessary for a person to be willfully putting themselves at risk. However it is not sufficient that agent S is knowledgeable of what the probabilistic outcomes are, for someone else could be coercing him into doing it. 

Proportionality as it applies to paternalism should be understood as follows:

Inherently risky behavior ought be evaluated based upon the associated probabilistic risk of a harmful outcome by experts. The relative risk should determine the seriousness of the constraints placed on those who wish to engage in the activity. 

Examples and Discussion:

Traditional Paternalism

Traditional paternalism is common. Seat belt and helmet laws are notoriously paternalistic. As are drug laws. Similarly, many pools and beaches only permit swimming in the presence of lifeguards. At their core, paternalistic regulations are infringements on personal freedom for the sake of well-being. The implication is that sometimes agents are not rational, and thus their best interest must be regulated for them; as if all rational agents share the same interests and those who disagree are thinking irrationally. Best interest or well-being is thus the objective for traditional paternalists. 

Gingivitis

Consider the experience of going to the dentist to have one’s teeth cleaned. If a dental hygienist notices gingivitis, she might inquire about one’s flossing habits, and suggest that if a person does not begin flossing at greater frequency the health of their gums will continue to deteriorate in such a way that teeth may be lost. This could be considered a soft paternalistic practice on the weaker end of the spectrum of possible expert authority. Hygienists and dentists do not have the authority to force a person to change their flossing habits yet they do have a perceived duty to inform people about the long-term consequences of their actions or inactions. By giving this information, oral health experts are increasing the knowledgeability of agents. So long as the information they are being given is accurate, agents are enabled from that point forward to make considerations about their own well-being that would have been impossible priorly. In this sense, agents who were previously operating from a position of ignorance are now informed. 

Part of the reason that I find soft paternalism to be so appealing is that spreading true information does not seem to have any foreseeable negative consequences. Each instance of informing agents gives them the opportunity to consider the long-term consequences of their behavior in a new way. If we imagine that soft-paternalism were instantiated in many new ways, agents might become more accustomed to thinking rationally about achieving their long-term ends. Soft paternalism is also useful in an immediate sense.

Mill’s Decrepit Bridge Example

A bridge is damaged and thus crossing it is treacherous. A man who only speaks Japanese approaches the bridge unaware of the danger. Another man who only speaks English is aware and stands between the Japanese man and the bridge. If the English-speaking hiker cannot convey the grave danger of crossing the bridge then he ought not allow the man to cross.

Conveying risk in this scenario is potentially a matter of life and death. The English speaking man could simply point at the bridge, shift his weight from left to right to left, attempting indicate its wobbliness and then make a tumbling gesture as he points downwards toward the bottom of the ravine. This might seem to convey the necessary message, but if the Japanese man were to fall to his death then the other might wonder if he had done enough to inform him. Thus raising the important question of how to determine sufficient knowledge. To explore the answer we will consider a new case.

Diabetes and Mountain Dew

Contemplate the plight of a doctor who meets a diabetic patient for the first time. The doctor explains that diabetes is a very serious condition and if the woman does not radically change her diet, her condition will significantly worsen. She seems to understand, nodding her head as he lists the possible consequences –becoming insulin dependent, decreased blood flow to limbs that could require amputation, etc. She returns to his office a few months later, carrying a bottle of Mountain Dew. At this point it seems clear to the doctor that she did not really understand his warnings. So he goes into greater detail about the way sugar is processed in the body and the way that excess sugar is exacerbating her condition. If the woman does not change, and test results over time indicate that her blood sugar level is consistently above normal, what should the doctor do?

Scope and Justified Discretion

Some paternalists would argue that this doctor would be justified in removing this woman’s privilege/right to consume products with added sugar. Imagine a society where everything a person buys is logged or tracked in some way. In such a society a person could simply have their access revoked. Such an action would likely improve her health in an objective way, in the type of way that paternalists frequently describe as well-being. But such a wide scale attempt might only cause wide scale suffering. Thresholds at which severely obese people could reasonably be expected to recover might have come and long passed. Such an effort to increase well-being does seem worthwhile in some sense, but it also seems cruel. Extreme legislation like this could make it illegal for someone to buy nearly any of the food that they love eating. 

If it hypothetically became a popular idea to implement a restrictive system where doctors could revoke privileges from the unhealthy, it seems far more humane to simply start anew with the youngest generation. So that future agents and more importantly their parents can be properly educated about the risks of obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Perhaps at that point, people will realize their long-term self-interest in a more rational way than previous generations. Intrigue aside, the argument for educating the young is essential to the success of soft paternalism. The hard questions about health-care professionals restricting food privileges could thus be avoided. Future generations might be enabled to avoid bad habits altogether or perhaps better learn to moderate consumption. 

Liberty and Well-Being

If a soft paternalist is committed to not infringing on potential liberty, then the scope of doctor’s discretionary power is exclusively educational. Some traditional paternalists might even say that soda should be banned outright. The traditional argument certainly permits this, as soda is in no way nutritious. Negative liberty and, more importantly, potential liberty would also decrease for agents who can enjoy soda in moderation. This phenomenon of the affected class being larger than the class whose well-being is being targeted is called impure paternalism. In contrast, pure paternalism is the concept that the affected class is identical to the target class. An example would be a pool that only allows swimming when a lifeguard is on duty. More so than moderate and occasional soda drinkers, there’s also the well-being of people who love soda. The traditional conception makes no attempt to weigh S’s concept of his own welfare, interests, values, or good; rather it assumes that G knows best on matters of S’s welfare. Benefits gained by actions that pose any risk of harm, are not even considered. 

Arguments of the following form have no merit in traditional paternalistic systems: 

1) S believes himself to be more productive or happy or whatever when he is able to partake in some risky behavior. 
2) S believes his well-being, in aggregate, over the course of his potentially shorter life is greater than if he were forced to live potentially longer by G’s conception.

The traditional argument states that G must merely believe that S’s well-being will improve under restriction of liberty X. It may be true that S’s physiological health or well-being would improve, but the lack of consideration for the other less tangible ways S’s well-being could diminish do seem relevant. To completely exploit the weakness of the traditional account, consider that a serial killer could justify the absurd action of murdering children by the logic that he believed they would not get into heaven if they were given the opportunity to grow up and inevitably sin. Perhaps such a thought experiment is at odds with the principle of charity, it still holds that the nearly infinite potential well-being of an entity stuck in a place like heaven for eternity is better than the outlook for an entity stuck in hell. Thus, mere belief may not be strong enough to justify encroachments on S’s liberty.

So far we have exposed a few problems with traditional paternalism, primarily, it disvalues S’s own conception of well-being; it may also be the case that X does not actually improve well-being in any measureable way, however G could be justified in instantiating it because of a belief that it would; and finally, it can be used to justifiably ban access to things for all agents, even though they would not all be harmed without X. The line at which harm or risk can be quantified is undefined and likely differs from case to case. To claim that soda and cigarettes are generally bad for human health, physiologically speaking is true. But it is also true that a single cigarette or soda is of negligible impact in the long run. So can the happiness or utility that an otherwise healthy person gains from an occasional cigarette or soda be nullified by the negative health consequences of habitual use? No. Nor can the potential utility gained by those who suffer from severe addiction; it is certainly possible that an agent could achieve more in a shorter life as a smoker than he could living longer as a non-smoker. Let’s turn now to the case of suffering agents who are restricted from treatments that experts agree have the potential to alleviate symptoms and reduce suffering.

Schedule 1 Substances

Currently, several substances are regarded as absolutely illegal for anyone to possess in the United States. Interestingly, experts in the fields of cancer treatment and epilepsy, among others, have found usefulness in marijuana; and therapists who specialize in the treatment of PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and depression have found usefulness in psilocybin mushrooms, MDMA, and LSD. These substances, largely studied in countries where they are legal to research in clinical environments, have shown substantial improvements in quality of life. Providing access for people who can demonstrate an understanding of the known dangers associated with the use of these substances is more consistent with liberty than prohibiting access to everyone –including those who might receive benefit. 

If we apply my theory to this case, we see that a softly paternalistic approach allows more people to have increased access to well-being, or treatment in this case. Those at a point of desperation with regard to other tried treatments would be able to potentially achieve their end of an improved standard of living. Consequentialists could argue that prohibiting access to these substances has a net positive utility because of their inherently high potential for abuse. I reject this conclusion for multiple reasons. Primarily because a relevant alternative has been suggested here that would further maximize utility. Most utilitarian theory suggests that hedonistic calculus must consider all relevant alternatives, and an application of soft paternalism could yield a better result. Restricting access based upon expert consideration of who could be reasonably expected to suffer a loss of well-being, and who might experience gains, is also more consistent with liberty. Such an approach can also be conceived as being flexible in a way that absolute prohibitions are not. Doctors, pharmacists or some type of experts could feasibly make mistakes, their initial assessments could be flawed; but a system could exist so they retain their discretionary power and can revoke access if necessary. Conceivably, access to more risky substances would depend upon satisfying the knowledge condition in a more extensive way than for less risky ones. Let’s explore a real life example where experts have ultimate authority.

Amateurs Attempting Everest

Climbing Mt. Everest is a notoriously dangerous activity however advances in technical clothing and the application of fixed rope systems have allowed many relatively inexperienced climbers to summit and survive the descent. Recently there has been a push by Himalayan natives, Sherpas, to prohibit inexperienced climbers from attempting the climb. The reason is that historically, many Sherpas have been put at great risk trying to carry rich foreigners off the mountain. This is relevant because it is a perfect example of experts passing judgment on who ought be able to attempt the ascent. Author Jon Krakauer once noted in 1996 that he witnessed guides teaching clients how to put on and use crampons, seemingly for the first time, at Everest Base Camp; which even an inexperienced mountaineer can recognize as insane. Although some climbers who have no business being on Everest may still slip through the cracks, increased pressure on guides to properly weed out amateurs will probably result in at least one less climber requiring rescue from certain death.

Rationality

Agency in the Everest case falls upon the guides. Thus it is a real life example where the scope of G’s authority is supreme. Infringement in that case may be justified because inexperienced climbers are ultimately risking not only their well-being but the well-being of others. So the Everest case is useful as an example of G having full discretion but it is not really paternalism. The claim that experts such as doctors ought have absolute discretion has not been made here, it has merely been suggested as a possibility. Its suggestion serves as a demonstration of the spectrum of possibilities related to soft paternalism. In its weaker form, soft paternalism is coercive in an annoying way like sitting through annual sexual-harassment training; in its stronger form it is like getting a driver’s license. Soft paternalism is fairly common in Xs that serve to protect the interests and well-being of others. But when solely focusing on the well-being of a single agent in a vacuum, it seems that his appeal to negative liberty is compelling and anything beyond education may be an unjustified infringement.

Readers may share my apprehensions about restricting liberty on the basis of an outsider’s conception of well-being. In which case we must admit that agents are free to commit suicide by any means. Sure they might be stopped by bystanders who try to empathize, share conceptions of well-being, and perhaps even physically intervene. Most significantly when the full realization of harm takes decades, decades of justifying things like smoking to others. But in this case, what is really happening?

Rationality is often conceived as being instrumental in nature. Meaning essentially that ends determine means, and the degree of an agent’s rationality depends upon the satisfaction of his ends. For the loved ones of smokers, the end is keeping the agent alive. However in the case of a bystander who sees a man getting ready to jump off a bridge, the end is the same yet something has changed. Rather than considering the man’s well-being in a self-interested way, to the extent that he, G, doesn’t want to lose the agent, S, from his life prematurely. The bystander in both bridge cases is compelled to act by the end of preserving life. As though health and physical survival are intrinsically valuable; and thus bystanders have some kind of duty to attempt to prevent the loss of life. Near the end of this paper is not the time to extensively consider the concept of duty, but it is worth noticing that government regulation seems to be more like a perceived duty to protect well-being. Just as the bystander must feel that he has sufficiently tried to help the suicidal man, before he can allow himself to walk away. We need not explore all the potential ends that could motivate/justify an Agent’s habitually dangerous behavior. But it should suffice to say that he is entitled to those ends and he is entitled to pursue them, however others, especially those with expert knowledge, are entitled to ensuring that he is behaving rationally -in so far as his long term-ends are congruent with his short-term means. The entailment here is that determining his rationality depends upon his ability to explain to those in positions of power that he at least understands the potential long-term consequences of his actions.

Neurosurgeons and Daredevils

How do we explain irrational behavior? And more importantly can irrational behavior justify intervention? The answer is that people take different means to different ends. Disagreements about both have merit. If agent A is an adrenaline junkie and agent B is a trauma neurosurgeon, their opinion on helmet laws would likely differ. If A is adamantly opposed and B is in adamant support, who is right? Reasons also seem important. If we reverse the opinions, things get even more interesting. Suppose A is a professional daredevil who takes serious precautions to ensure maximum safety; and B enjoys trying to repair people’s brains. Who is the real expert here? They both are, and the diversity of the information that their experiences have led them each to understand as true have merit to anyone curious about the justification of helmet laws. 

The ‘end’ of paternalistic regulation is to increase well-being (or prevent its decrease). But as was explored in discussion above, an agent’s conception of well-being may vary significantly from the conception held by authority figure G. Traditional paternalistic regulation makes value judgments about which means agents are permitted to pursue and also which ends have merit. Thus I have not been compelled that infringements upon the liberty of all agents can be justified by appeal to well-being for those who are at risk. The only value judgment made by soft paternalism is that knowledge of risk is better than ignorance of risk.

Conclusion:

High-risk behavior need not be absolutely prohibited but in many cases people do need to be protected from risk that they do not understand; however this does not justify prohibition for agents who might realize increases in well-being. Soft paternalism as characterized here is above all else an education process that results in greater opportunity. Liberty is not only maintained in such a system but it is expanded. The most important thing is that a path to fulfilling ones desires exists. Highly dangerous things must be respected as such, and in extreme cases only a small number of experts are qualified to assess the readiness of agents to take on risks of the highest magnitude. The understanding one must demonstrate to earn such a trust should not be easy. As is abundantly clear in the United States, the threat to well-being presented by some substances like high calorie fatty foods and sugary beverages has been underestimated. The prevalence of obesity, diabetes and heart disease should serve as ample evidence that reconsideration is necessary and I believe soft paternalism’s viability has been demonstrated.
