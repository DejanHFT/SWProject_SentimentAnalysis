Movies with ridiculous plots that serve as social critiques?,ccbuddyrider,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6v3ips/movies_with_ridiculous_plots_that_serve_as_social/,245,163,"I have a friend who is trying to get into film, and his favorite films are Eternal Sunshine and the Truman Show. So after some discussion, he told me he liked them because they were kind of ridiculous, but were used as a way to critique social norms/etc. I already recommended him The Lobster, but is there anything sort of in the vein of these movies that I can recommend him?"
