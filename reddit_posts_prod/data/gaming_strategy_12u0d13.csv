Searching for a military modern strategy game...,Weider2,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/12u0d13/searching_for_a_military_modern_strategy_game/,5,5,...where you have your base and you have to conquer some points on the map and defend them. And build more buildings for your base. The main goal is to destroy or conquer the base of the opponent. It was 1 vs 1. The game was months ago in a test phase on steam. I can\`t find it again. Maybe a few here tested it too? It was not Broken Arrow or Warno. The graphic was not that good but ok.
