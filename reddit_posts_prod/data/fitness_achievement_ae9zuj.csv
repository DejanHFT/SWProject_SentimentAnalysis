Help with achieving 2019 resolution: 1 minute long free standing hand stand.,KlinkzA,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ae9zuj/help_with_achieving_2019_resolution_1_minute_long/,8,23,"Hello.

29/M/5'10""/158lb. I have been bouncing in between weightlifting routines and currently I'm on a workout that focuses on two major muscle groups per work out at a 5 set range from 8-12 reps. I also put in a couple calisthenic days with pushups, air squats, and pullups. It's about 5-6 days per week.

This year I told myself I want to work on handstands and complete a 1 minute long free standing hand stand. Any advice on how I can train this while I continue to lift and work towards gaining lean muscle?

Any advice is welcomed!"
