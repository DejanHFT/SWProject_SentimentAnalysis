"Achievement Unlocked: Yesterday, I Pressed 135 lbs Over My Head for the First Time - Another Psychological Milestone",ltcolonelnemo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ij6a0/achievement_unlocked_yesterday_i_pressed_135_lbs/,38,33,"And boy was it great!  Especially since back in January of 2011, when I began Starting Strength, I couldn't even do 85lbs.

Two things were running through my head:

1.  ""No dimes for me today bro, I'm only puttin' up plates!""

2.  This song:

I have been using the same set/rep method that I used for bench press that has so far gotten me up to 232.5.

Basically, I do the warm up sets of: 

Bar x 5  x 2, Intermediate sets of increasing weight for 5, 3, 1 reps.

Work sets:

1 x 2 or 2 x 1 reps at maximal weight
12 reps for as much as I can handle
5 reps for as much as I can handle
8 reps for mas much as I can handle

All of these sets are bench-marked, and I try to go up either in weight by 2.5 lbs or by reps.  When I reach my rep target, I increase the weight.  My max has been going up every work-out for the past month, and the lower weight sets go up once every week or week and a half.  I use this method of bench press and over-head press.

I'm not sure if I should try it with the deadlift.  
My squats still suck.  : (

My overall goal is build muscle, lose fat, so I'm counting calories.
Other stats: 6'2, 212 lbs (down from 235 when I started), age 33.
