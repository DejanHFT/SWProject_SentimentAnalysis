Do you have any literary tattoos? What do you need from a book or author that would entice you to get a tattoo?,SadBrontosaurus,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15hk5by/do_you_have_any_literary_tattoos_what_do_you_need/,182,74,"I'm currently planning out the inside half of my literary sleeve. The [outside half](https://imgur.com/a/0Zz1bzM) is inspired by Gustave Dore artwork from some epics (at the top I have [The Empyrean (Dante and Beatrice at the highest level of Heaven)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Paradiso_Canto_31.jpg/540px-Paradiso_Canto_31.jpg), from Dante's Paradiso. Below that is [Death on a Pale Horse](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Gustave_Dore_-_Death_on_the_Pale_Horse.png/1641px-Gustave_Dore_-_Death_on_the_Pale_Horse.png), from the Book of Revelations. Then I have [The Fall of Lucifer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Paradise_Lost_12.jpg/822px-Paradise_Lost_12.jpg), from Paradise Lost, and it ends with [The Death](https://the-public-domain-review.imgix.net/shop/nov-21-prints-00009.jpeg) from Poe's The Raven). For me, the outside is less about my personal feelings, and more about homage to works and authors of the past.

The inside will be more about my personal favorites. I'll be starting in my armpit with a piece inspired by Gollum in the cave (from Tolkien's The Hobbit - and all the pieces will be in the same style as the outside of the sleeve), and will also be looking for art to represent King, Koontz, Weir, Gaiman, Pratchett, Vonnegut, and some others. The Hobbit is especially important to me as it's basically the book that inspired me to start reading. In second grade I went from barely literate to a college reading level thanks to an oversized, illustrated Rankin/Bass edition of The Hobbit. It changed my life!

I want to see your artwork, know what inspired you to get tattooed (or what would), and I'd also love to hear some of your favorite moments from the authors I've already listed, especially if you think they could inspire some beautiful art!"
