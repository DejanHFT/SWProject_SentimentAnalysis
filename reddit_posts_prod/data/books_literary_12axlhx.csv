Pride and Prejudice is a true English literary masterpiece,TalhaAhmad,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12axlhx/pride_and_prejudice_is_a_true_english_literary/,57,170,"I finally got around to reading Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. Slow at times, throughly engaging at others, Pride and Prejudice is a literary masterpiece that is worthy of all the praise it has received.

The novel revolves around the family of Bennets with Elizabeth Bennet the principal character. Mrs Bennet is eager to marry off her daughters when Mr Bingley and his friend Mr Darcy happen to arrive in their neighbourhood. 

The characters were well fleshed and drawn out. This was true especially for the two main characters - Elizabeth and Mr Darcy. The character development both of them go throughout the length of the book is so well written. The interactions between the two also formed the most pleasing passages of the novel. Austen provided commentaries by Elizabeth after every event in a book. Every other character was also thoroughly etched out. 

To say the book was hard to read would be an understatement. Jane Austen's prodigious ability to write such long sentences that are to be read more than once to absorb them completely, are testament to her writing prowess. But the satisfaction after rejoicing in what she wrote justified all the effort employed in reading her passages. 

There are also many memorable quotes that have been endlessly repeated and memorized. Overall, it truly feels like a triumph of English literature and worthy of its prestigious standing."
