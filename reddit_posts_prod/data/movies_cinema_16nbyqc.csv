What are some satisfying villain deaths in cinema?,Dapper_Bee2277,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16nbyqc/what_are_some_satisfying_villain_deaths_in_cinema/,157,41,"I just watched ""The Name of the Rose"" and ""Apocalypto"" both had some nasty villains who died in a similar way. It's the mark of a good film to not only set up a villain but to also have them get their come upance in a satisfying way. I think my favorite is from ""The Interview"", the music and the special effects elevated it to the next level."
