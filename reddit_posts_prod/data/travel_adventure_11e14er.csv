Iâ€™ve done some research on Contiki, Intrepid, Ultimate EF and G adventures. I am leaning towards traveling with G adventures.

Any experiences or thoughts with G adventures in regards to accommodations, tour guides, transportation, and communication? I am opting to do a classic tour with them for the Best of Southern Spain."
