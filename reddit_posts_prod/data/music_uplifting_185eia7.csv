A frontman that blew your mind during a live show?,ChadOfDoom,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/185eia7/a_frontman_that_blew_your_mind_during_a_live_show/,596,126,"My two most recent shows were Noah Gundersen and The Mars Volta. Both were spectacular. The way Noah connects with his crown and leaves you feeling happy and uplifted was something I need more of.

Anyone else have any extra good experiences from live shows?"
