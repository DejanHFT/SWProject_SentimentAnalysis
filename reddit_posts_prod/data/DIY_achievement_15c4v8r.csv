Knife switch,plhenry12,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/15c4v8r/knife_switch/,3,4,"I’m interested in building a knife switch that will spark when flipped. The plan is for it to be the main light switch in my garage which is Batcave “themed”. 
Any suggestions for how to achieve this are great appreciated. 
Thanks!"
