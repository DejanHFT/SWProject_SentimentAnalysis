How to understand (critique) the movie? [help],GoldenBeat,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5kwirw/how_to_understand_critique_the_movie_help/,41,57,"Hello,

I'm a 22 old guy who really enjoyes movies. I have always liked watching them and I think I will too. But over the time, I noticed that I'm a dumb movie watcher. For example, I watch a movie and I usually find it good, since it passed time for me and was an entertainment. I rarely think a movie is bad or not good. And even if I do, I can't find bad things about them. 

I want to learn what to look for in a movie that will help me rate it after I watch it. I want to learn how to critique it, how to find the good and the bad parts. I want to become a person who doesn't just watch a movie and then says it was alright. Help me become a better person.


Edit: I would like to thank you for the amazing tips on how to read into a movie. A few of you said that once this becomes a thing to do, to critically think, it's not turn offable and I must say that I really don't mind that for now. I suppose eventually it could become a nuisance or not (i don't believe it will), but it makes me much happier right now if I could disect a movie and understand it, know what they tried to tell and all those other things that go with the music, directing, acting, script. Thank you also for the suggestive read and watch. "
