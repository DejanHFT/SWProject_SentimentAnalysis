Literary Whiplash,fieldenm,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xmhknz/literary_whiplash/,5,5,"I have been on a non-fiction tear lately but this has happened to me regardless of genre. I read Paula by Isabel Allende then followed it up with The Dirt by Tommy Lee. Both were well written, interesting, and impactful memoirs but it was mentally jarring to go from the poetic prose of Allende to vivid descriptions of Motely Crue antics.

With fiction,  I have a strategy of reading a fluffy rom-com after challenging books. Two fluffy rom-coms after books like A Clockwork Orange, Johnny Got his Gun, and anything by Cormac McCarthy. Other than taking a break from reading, what strategies do you have to prevent literary whiplash?"
