Reducing testosterone levels to get past insurance company red tape. I am without energy to exercise as well as too depressed.,SurprizFortuneCookie,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1kybm9/reducing_testosterone_levels_to_get_past/,143,33,"I had a blood test and was found to have 251ng/dL testosterone levels, which is extremely low for a 30yo male, but not low enough for my insurance to pay for the $500 a month medication.  

I have a new blood test coming up and I am wondering if there is a way to lower my testosterone levels a bit so insurance will pay for treatment.  

My testosterone levels are greatly interfering with my workouts, my ability to retain muscle, my mood, and my quality of life. Please help, Fitness.

I apologize if this is the wrong place to ask, but thank you for your help"
