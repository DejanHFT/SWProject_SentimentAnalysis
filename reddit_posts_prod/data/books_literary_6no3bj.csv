What are your biggest literary blind spots?,whatwouldsugarsay,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6no3bj/what_are_your_biggest_literary_blind_spots/,110,31,"I just saw that the trailer for  the *A Wrinkle in Time* movie, and a huge chunk of my newsfeed is super excited about it -- and I just realized that I never read that book as a kid, which feels like a huge oversight. 

And it got me thinking: What are your literary **blind spots** -- books or authors (maybe even whole genres) that are hugely influential, but that you seem to have missed the boat on? 

(Another one of mine is Stephen King -- I haven't read a single Stephen King novel in my life, which seems like something I should correct, but somehow I never get around to it.) "
