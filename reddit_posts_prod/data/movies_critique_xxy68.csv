"The case for ""Hook""",beergoggles69,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/xxy68/the_case_for_hook/,2534,1654,"One of my favourite films growing up was Steven Spielberg's *Hook*.

Even at a young age I think I was a naturally nostalgic person with an interest in history, so I've always had a soft spot for movies with characters who are from another time, or movies that track a character's life from their childhood until they get old. I don't know what it is about nostalgia but it *gets* to me. It's one of the reasons I like biopics. I find that if I'm googling the subject of a film straight after I've seen it, the film has had a pretty big impact on me. The first time I saw *Amadeus* I spent the rest of the day researching Mozart, it was nuts.

So anyway, I watched *Hook* tonight because I hadn't seen it for years and I found that it was just as good as I remembered. I've since read that it wasn't all that well received when it came out, (one critique was that kids wouldn't ""get"" it) and I basically wanted to know what Reddit thinks of *Hook*. I know a lot of people are around my age (mid-20s) so would have seen it when they were kids, whereas others may have been adults when it came out. Basically it's an evaluation of the effect a big-budget family movie can have on people of different ages. 

Some notable points:

* Dustin Hoffman is fucking incredible as Hook. Obviously I didn't know who Dustin Hoffman was when I was 6 years old, but he absolutely kills in this role. If you haven't seen this film as an adult, he's pretty much worth the price of... download, I guess.

* The part where the fat kid turns into a ball and rolls down the gangway is just as funny as it was 20 years ago (to me anyway).

* As I said, I'm a nostalgic guy, so the scenes with Maggie Smith as Wendy really hit me. I like the idea of Wendy being a real person who is in her nineties and longs for her time with Peter as a child again. My heartstrings: they were tugged.

* Some parts of the movie are lame, but when you remember it's pretty much a kids movie on steroids, it makes it all okay. Any scenes with the lost boys can be especially grating if you focus too much on the ""acting"".

Anyway, I'd love to hear what reddit thinks. Good or bad.

**edit:** turns out it's 98% good... film critics clearly underestimate kids' comprehension of themes in movies. Thanks everyone!"
