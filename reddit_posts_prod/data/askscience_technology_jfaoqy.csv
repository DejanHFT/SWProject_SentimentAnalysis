Poop, sludgy grease, and leftover food seem best destined for the nearest landfill or wastewater resource recovery facility.

But when paired with waste-to-energy technology, these things can become downright energetic---in the form of biofuels. Organic wastes serve as potential biofuel feedstocks, and they are available just about anywhere across the nation.

Bioenergy experts at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have developed a process called Hydrothermal Liquefaction, or HTL, which can literally turn breakfast (leftovers) into biocrude.

HTL mimics the geological conditions the Earth uses to create crude oil, using high pressure and temperature to achieve in minutes what has typically taken millions of years. The resulting material is similar to petroleum pumped out of the ground, but also contains small amounts of water, oxygen, and sometimes nitrogen.

HTL has advantages over other thermochemical conversion methods. It works best with wet biomass - like [poop](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/how-wastewater-treatment-plants-could-be-pumping-out-fuel-instead-sludge), algae, and food and [agriculture wastes](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/boosting-biocrude-gaining-twice-fuel-corn-waste) - heck, even [beer waste](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/pnnl-researchers-make-beer-run-name-science)! It has the ability to transform almost all of the biomass into biocrude oil. It also offers opportunities to recover nutrients such as phosphorous, an element in fertilizer that is needed to grow food.

Our research using HTL is typically supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's [Bioenergy Technologies Office](https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy), who works with government, industrial, academic, agricultural, and nonprofit partners across the nation to develop commercially viable, high-performance biofuels, bioproducts, and biopower made from renewable biomass resources that reduce our dependence on oil while enhancing energy security.

We are down with that! Come ask us questions about our research and [analyses](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/breakfast-biocrude-study-identifies-production-potential-across-nation) using HTL, we are excited to have the conversation with you. We will be back at noon PDT to answer your questions.
