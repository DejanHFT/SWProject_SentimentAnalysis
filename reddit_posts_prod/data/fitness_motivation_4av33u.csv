I'm 5'5 and half asian looking for some motivation?,RandomBellend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4av33u/im_55_and_half_asian_looking_for_some_motivation/,61,1,"Any ya'll maafks got transformation pics of males that are short like me? I'm 21 so I won't be growing anymore. I have diabetes and was diagnosed at 4 years old. This probably limited my growth a bit, but hey ho what can u do. 

Looking for some motivation as I had some negative comments before off some people during work. 'the little lad, oh I shouldn't call him little.. but he's so little' 

Yeah cheers. Hey look it's that fat bitch. I shouldn't call her fat, but shes so fat. 

I digress.

MOTIVATION? PLS?

Edit: 

Okay, so when I said asian dude, I meant I look like this guy. http://i.imgur.com/FYn0skf.png
