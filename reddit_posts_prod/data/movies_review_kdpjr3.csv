> Critics consensus: Great Hera! Wonder Woman 1984 is an epic dose of heart and vibrant escapism that proves there are still unexpected thrills to be found in superhero cinema.

[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/wonder-woman-1984): 67/100 (27 critics)

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie.

> There's still a lot to love. Gadot remains a charismatic presence who wields the lasso with authority, even tethering lightning bolts in some arresting moments. However, I missed the more hand-to-hand gladiatorial aspect of so many fight scenes in the first movie. There's a disarming romantic touch in Diana acquiring the ability of flight through Steve's explanation of its rudimentary principles. But watching her soar through the air — while consistent with later editions of the comic — also detracts from the athletic leaps that make the character distinctive, turning her into an ersatz Superman with a cuter outfit.

> “Wonder Woman 1984” is all about playing with magic and wishes and desires, only to see them lead to horrible ramifications, instant gratification, and the revelation that lying is never without consequence. Those are some big swings, and not every single one lands, but the ones that do are both joyous and genuinely worth pondering. And yet it’s also brimming with the same wonder and joy as the first film, the rare movie — of any stripe — that doesn’t just want to believe in the goodness of people, but is willing to make them truly work for it. That’s superheroic.

> As the wishes stack up and the world falls into chaos, “Wonder Woman 1984” loses its way, and while it’s not bad enough to renounce the satisfaction of what came before, it’s enough to shift our focus back to our own real-world predicament. What we need right now this movie can’t solve, but just maybe, it will inspire someone who can.

-[Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2020/film/reviews/wonder-woman-1984-review-sequel-1234853844/)

> Not everything in “WW84” works perfectly. Kristen Wiig is as terrific as you’d expect as Barbara/Cheetah, but in the latter incarnation her getup is a little too close to “CATS” for comfort. And while Pedro Pascal makes for an entertaining foil, he’s about as menacing as a second-tier Bond villain and clearly no match for Diana Prince, let alone Wonder Woman. Still, it’s absolutely thrilling to see the great Amazon warrior taking flight once again and making the world a much better and safer place. Wonder Woman is a hero for the ’80s and a hero for the ages.

> Still, the action-packed, heartwarming flick hits more than it misses, especially for fans waiting through a year full of release delays. And fortunately, Jenkins is the resident Santa Claus, gifting us this holiday season – even those stuck at home – with an action-packed, heartwarming flick full of grace, goodness and a tank-flipping, whip-smacking, baddie-bashing Gadot.

> Even if the notion of wishes — making them, and then takesies-backsies — isn’t quite a cinematic enough concept to support Wonder Woman’s final face-off with Lord, “Wonder Woman 1984” still brings a freshness and a wit that’s often lacking in these gargantuan costumed-hero sagas. Can’t wait to see what she does in the ’90s.

> Originally set for release in December 2019, a series of delays have meant that Wonder Woman 1984 has come to us a whole year later than planned. But that 12-month postponement has inadvertently helped it land exactly at a time that can benefit from it the most. Wonder Woman 1984 is a film with a heart full of hope and love; a nostalgic look back to a beloved time that provides escapism from an exceptionally difficult year. The adherence to a more classic superhero template means it is lacking in any genuine surprise or outstanding innovation, but this approach is always filtered through Jenkins’ contemporary lens, which lends it distinct humanity amongst the ‘80s cheese. A notable improvement on its already great predecessor, Wonder Woman 1984 is exactly the kind of bright and hopeful movie the character’s legacy deserves.

-[Matt Purslow, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/wonder-woman-1984-review): 8.0 ""great""

> This is an epically long and epically brash film from director and co-writer Patty Jenkins, but Gadot has a queenly self-possession and she imposes her authority on it.

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/15/wonder-woman-1984-review-gal-gadot-kristen-wiig-patty-jenkins): 3/5

> A vibrant and virtuous adventure packed with all the heart and heroism we’ve come to expect from DC’s shining light. Wonder Woman 1984 really is the hero 2020 needed all along.

-[Ben Travis, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/wonder-woman-1984/): 4/5

> Director Patty Jenkins has followed that original film... with something much longer, cornier and wobblier, but which is energised with a streak of pure movie-star enchantment that recalls the sparkly-eyed uplift of the Christopher Reeve Superman films.

-[Robbie Collin, The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/wonder-woman-1984-review-superhero-spectacle-save-cinemas/): 3/5

> Not unlike its predecessor, this film’s finale is overwrought, its stakes overdrawn — even though, maddeningly, they really don’t need to be when the essential conflict is so clear and compelling. Perhaps inevitably, Jenkins herself did not prove immune to the excess that she spent her ambitious 150-minute-long movie denouncing; that runtime alone is more than a little self-indulgent. But hey, if this year has taught us anything, it’s to give each other a break — and to allow ourselves our indulgences. Maybe Wonder Woman will be the one to save us, after all.

> “Wonder Woman 1984” is more than just mere disappointment or let down from the last film, it’s just misguided from the start of its dreamstone plot. Which is such a shame. For all its hopes and dreams, ‘WW84’ has much ambition, but fails to attain the engaging and inspirational greatness it seeks.

> I do wonder how this would have played in a theater (which you can, technically, still do instead of just watching it on HBO Max.) Because this is a movie of “hijinks” and the actual plot is pretty drawn out. I do wonder if I’d have gotten antsy in a theater, as opposed to sitting on my couch at home where I could have watched another hour of Wonder Woman and Maxwell Lord having a blast. But, that’s not reality right now. And I’m looking at Wonder Woman 1984 as a sort of gift to help all of us get through the pandemic-year holidays. It’s a perfect thing for those of us who can’t make it back home to watch. And, again, Wonder Woman 1984 is pure sugar. There’s little nutritional value. But we all deserve dessert right now.
