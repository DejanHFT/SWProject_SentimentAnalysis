Here come the Nth post about creative block, burnout and imposter syndrome, yaaay. Sorry, I'm quite salty. It's 5 am where I live and not feeling really that well.  


A bit of context :

I'm a freshly graduated graphic designer (since June). I'm glad I got where I am, after fours years of hard work, with the pandemic and personnal problems in my family. After six months of non stop stress and work for my final exam I have decided to take some time during the holidays to rest.

But here's the problem : I've started to work recently with my girlfriend in a project that involves some graphic design. As I consider myself mastering some of the things used for that, I was glad to participate. Eh, I was wrong, it's terrible.

I feel shitty because I'm feeling like unable to swim years after winning the world championship, or something like that. She's kind of pushing me in order to get that project finished and maybe that's the issue but I can't feel feeling overwhelmed by the pressure of getting the job done.

I'm seriously wondering if I am ""made for the job"", if this was a mistake or not. The truth is I think I love designing things, making 3D objets, doing motion design, logos and stuff, but when it comes to do it for work I just can't.

Is it imposter syndrome ? Is it creative block ? Is it burnout, without even have really worked a daily job in that field ever ?

Voila, thanks for coming to my TED talk. If someone has two cents of answers, I'd be glad to read them !

P.S. : sorry, English is not my first language so some mistake might have been here and there. And also if this isn't the right place to post, just let me know !"
