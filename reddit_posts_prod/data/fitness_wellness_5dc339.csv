"I think I'm eating well, getting my macros, minding my form, and yet, I see little progress on certain lifts. Advice?",tehlolredditor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5dc339/i_think_im_eating_well_getting_my_macros_minding/,47,12,"I'm 21, I started lifting for fat loss and tried ""cutting"", but I was overall quite weak. I was 163 at my lowest, but now I'm almost 180 lbs. I'm following a ""split"" routine (?) with different areas on different days (arms, chest, etc.)

Rn my biggest disappointment is my bench. I can't go past a 25lb plate. I try and keep form down as best as I can. I thought eating more would help but I just feel fatter lol (went from ~1700 cal to 2200 cal, around 140 protein).

I don't know if I just need to eat more, or if im just a bad lifter. Honesty never saw any ""beginner gains"" so maybe that's just a broscience myth. Any suggestions on how to approach progress and getting stronger (for bench)? I do 5X5, but I may need to do something different that involves me doing greater weight for lower reps.  Thanks for any help and tell me if there's other info you need.

**edit: thanks for the suggestions. I think I know what I have to do**"
