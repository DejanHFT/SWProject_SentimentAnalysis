"I am Alex Filippenko, astrophysicist and enthusiastic science popularizer at the University of California, Berkeley. Today is Astronomy Day, a good public outreach opportunity for this ""gateway science,"" so go ahead and AMA.",AlexFilippenko,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3lkoul/i_am_alex_filippenko_astrophysicist_and/,162,513,"I'm Alex Filippenko - a world-renowned research astrophysicist who helped discover the Nobel-worthy accelerating expansion of the Universe. Topics of potential interest include cosmology, supernovae, dark energy, black holes, gamma-ray bursts, the multiverse, gravitational lensing, quasars, exoplanets, Pluto, eclipses, or whatever else you'd like. In 2006, I was named the US National Professor of the Year, and I strive to communicate complex subjects to the public. I’ve appeared in more than 100 TV documentaries, and produced several astronomy video series for The Great Courses.  

I’ve also been working to help UC's Lick Observatory thrive, securing a million-dollar gift from the Making & Science team at Google. The Reddit community can engage and assist with this stellar research, technology development, education, and public outreach [by making a donation here](http://bit.ly/1Li9Ypl).

I look forward to answering your questions, and sharing my passion for space and science!

EDIT - That's all I can answer for now, but I will be checking in on this thread periodically and may get to answer a few more later. Thank you for all of the great questions!"
