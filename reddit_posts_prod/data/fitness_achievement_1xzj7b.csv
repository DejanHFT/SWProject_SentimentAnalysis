Are my strength and physique goals achievable within two years?,nth-user,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1xzj7b/are_my_strength_and_physique_goals_achievable/,54,6,"Hi Fittit,

I've finally started setting goals instead of just training. Unfortunately I'm inexperienced in this area and I would greatly appreciate it if you would be able to look at my plans to see if they're achievable in the time frame I've allotted.

I am currently progressing through StrongLifts 5x5 with added bodyweight pull ups and dips.

Here are my stats:

**Physique**

    Measurement  Current            Goal

    Height:      183cm (6'0"")       -

    Body Fat:    15%                8%
    Waist:       84cm (33"")         76cm (30"")

The physique measurements are based off [a profile I found on bodybuilding.com](http://bodyspace.bodybuilding.com/bigmike80/). [This is the physique I want to achieve.](http://i.imgur.com/42GaxRQ.jpg)

I have started doing Leangains, here are my macros:

**Leangains Macros**

    Day        Protein    Fat    Carbs    Calories

    Rest:      150g       125g   95g      2100kcal
    Training:  150g       70g    460g     3050kcal

I have set my strength goals for ~~January 1st, 2015~~ (**UPDATED: January 1st, 2016)** and my physique goals for January 1st 2016. These are arbitrary at the moment and I would appreciate any advice to make sure these are as realistic as possible.

Thank you very much in advance!"
