What is the difference between machine learning and data analytics?,MisterHeatMiser,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/739gmt/what_is_the_difference_between_machine_learning/,5,1,"I understand that machine learning is a way to teach AIs by using large data sets while big data analytics is essentially finding solutions using big data sets, but they seem to have the same outcome.  I can see how I'm comparing apples and oranges here, but I can't seem to get my head around it.  Please help."
