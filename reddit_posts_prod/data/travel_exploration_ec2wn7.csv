Patagonia exploration by motorcycle Jan 15 to 22,firedudecndn,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ec2wn7/patagonia_exploration_by_motorcycle_jan_15_to_22/,9,3,"Canadian citizen travelling to Chile in January 2020.

Part of the trip is picking up a motorcycle in Punta Arenas and exploring.  

I have it for about a week.


My question is;  I don't want to spend all day, every day on the bike.   People who have been there or travelled there, would you recommend or suggest I travel to a different town or city for a few days to further explore the area or use Punta Arenas as a base for the whole week?

I purchased the border crossing authorization so Argentina could also be on the menu. 

Open to suggestions.  Thanks in advance."
