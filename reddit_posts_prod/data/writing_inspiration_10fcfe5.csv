Getting mixed inspiration for my stories,Org_Hrky,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/10fcfe5/getting_mixed_inspiration_for_my_stories/,5,6,"So I'll try to keep it short, I consume a lot of content, predominantly from anime, but live action TV shows as well. I always wanted to create my own stories. The problem is that storytelling is in every type of story different and they each have their own ""thing"" that makes them special. One story might focus on a cool magic system, the other on complex character dynamics, the other maybe on ideology and history etc. No two stories are the same, because essentially the feeling I get from consuming either one is different.  


So it's normal that I get inspired by what I consume and sort of reflect that on my stories. I started writing my novel after consuming a lot of Fairy Tail content (an anime I like) so my novel went into the same direction as said anime. I then started watching Game Of Thrones, so I wanted to make my novel more grittier. Now, after 100 pages of it, I've started consuming HunterxHunter, another very different type of show which focuses on different things, so I thought about re-writing the novel to go into the direction of HunterxHunter. And I notice that I have a problem where the I have difficulties setting a foundation of my story because I like all these different stories and I don't know which style I want to settle for. This wasn't at all short, I apologize, but any advice would be appreciated."
