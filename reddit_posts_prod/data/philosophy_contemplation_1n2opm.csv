A “Who’s Who” of Kierkegaard’s Formidable Army of Pseudonyms,ConclusivePostscript,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1n2opm/a_whos_who_of_kierkegaards_formidable_army_of/,3,60,"The following is a list of Kierkegaard’s many and diverse pseudonyms, whose works together constitute roughly half of Kierkegaard’s authorship (not counting his letters, journals, and notebooks). It is not, of course, intended to excuse “the single individual” from reading the pseudonymous works for him- or herself and gaining a kind of “personal familiarity” with their authors, but simply to highlight the scope and diversity of this side of the Kierkegaardian corpus and provide a little context for those only familiar with the more popular works (*Either/Or*, *Fear and Trembling*, *Concluding Postscript*, etc.). I shall save general commentary for next time, but questions and comments concerning individual pseudonyms are more than welcome.

**Victor Eremita** – “Victorious hermit,” general editor of *Either/Or*, who also appears in the first part of its sequel, *Stages on Life’s Way*. Also the author of the satirical article “A Word of Thanks to Professor Heiberg.”

**A** – The anonymous author and editor of the contents of the first book of *Either/Or*, whom Eremita simply calls “A,” and who represents an “aesthetic” life-view. Also author of “A Cursory Observation Concerning a Detail in Don Giovanni.”

**Johannes the Seducer** – Author of *The Seducer’s Diary*, the final part of the first book of *Either/Or*, whose relation to “A” is obscure and controversial among scholars. Like Eremita, appears in the first part of *Stages*.

**B** (or **Judge William**) – Author of the contents of the second book of *Either/Or* and the second part of *Stages*, both representing the “ethical” life-view.

**A. F.** – Author of the article, “Who is the Author of *Either/Or*?”

**William of Afham** – Author of the first, “aesthetic” part of *Stages*, i.e., *“In Vino Veritas”: A Recollection*. Afham means “by him,” and a draft of *Stages* has “*Rapport ad se ipsum*,” Latin for “report to himself.”

**Frater Taciturnus** – “Silent Brother,” author of the third, “religious” part of *Stages*, i.e., *“Guilty?”/“Not Guilty?”*. Also author of two articles associated with the “*Corsair* affair”: “The Activity of a Traveling Esthetician and How He Still Happened to Pay for the Dinner” and “The Dialectical Result of a Literary Police Action.”

**Quidam** – Frater Taciturnus’ “imaginatively constructed” author of the diary portion of *“Guilty?”/“Not Guilty?”* in *Stages* (thus, in effect, a construction of a construction). His name is Latin for “Someone.”

**Hilarius Bookbinder** – Recipient, compiler, and publisher of the diverse parts of *Stages*. First name Latin for “merry” or “joyful.”

**Johannes de Silentio** – “John of Silence,” author of *Fear and Trembling*, whose last “problema” thematizes the relation of silence and the religious life.

**Constantin Constantius** – Author of *Repetition*, whose name doubly reflects the title and key concept of this work (i.e., in consisting of a “repetition” and in alluding to repetition’s constancy). *See also the unused Victorinus and Walter below.*

**The Young Man** – Unnamed poet and author of the letters to Constantius in *Repetition*. Also appears along with Eremita, the Seducer, and Constantius in the first part of *Stages*.

**Vigilius Haufniensis** – “Watchman of Copenhagen,” author of *The Concept of Anxiety* (whose quasi-sequel is Anti-Climacus’ *The Sickness Unto Death*).

**Nicolaus Notabene** – Author of *Prefaces*. His name has a twofold reference: N.N. was a Danish abbreviation indicating anonymity (cf. our use of “Mr. X”), while the Latin phrase *nota bene* means “note well.”

**Johannes Climacus** – Author of *Philosophical Fragments* and *Concluding Unscientific Postscript to* Philosophical Fragments (which is, in keeping with Climacus’ pervasive use of irony, about five times the size of *Fragments* itself); also author of Kierkegaard’s posthumous *Johannes Climacus, or: De Omnibus Dubitandum Est*; named after St. John Climacus, 7th-century Christian monk and author of *The Ladder of Divine Ascent*.

**Anti-Climacus** – Author of *The Sickness Unto Death* and *Practice in Christianity*; here “Anti-” does not signify “against” Climacus but rather “higher in rank” than him; of *Practice* Kierkegaard claimed, “Without a doubt it is the most perfect and the truest thing I have written …”

**H. H.** – Author of *Two Ethical-Religious Essays*. Kierkegaard also considered using M. M. for this work, or using H. H., F. F. and P. P. as “guerrillas” for both this and *Practice*, but decided upon H. H. alone for the former and Anti-Climacus for the latter.

**Inter et Inter** – Author of *The Crisis and a Crisis in the Life of an Actress*. His name is Latin for “between and between,” which suggests an intermission or interlude between Kierkegaard’s religious works and may also call to mind the Latin translation of “either/or,” i.e., “*aut/aut*.”

**Procul** – Author of “Herr Phister as Captain Scipio”; his name, Latin for “from a distance,” may allude to the distance between actor and theatre critic, and perhaps to the distancing tendency of the pseudonymous authorship generally.

***Unused Pseudonyms***

**Petrus Minor** – Author of *The Book on Adler*, a book Kierkegaard decided not to publish (for Adler’s sake), and for which he had contemplated several other pseudonyms, including Thomas Minor, Vincentius Minor, and Ataraxius Minor.

**A.B.C.D.E.F. Godthaab/Rosenblad** – “Apprentice author” of the unfinished and posthumous *Writing Sampler* (intended to be a sequel to *Prefaces*). Godthaab is Danish for “good hope,” while Rosenblad—stricken out on the title page—means “roseleaf” or “rose petal” and may be a satirical allusion to Claud Rosenhoff, who had authored a review of *Either/Or* that incurred Kierkegaard’s scorn. A.W.S.H. Rosenblad and A.W.A.H. Rosenblad were also considered—and more ridiculous yet, one draft has “Willibald, Alexander, Alexius, Theodor, Holger Rosenpind or Rosenblad.”

**Emanuel Leisetritt** – Considered for *Two Ethical-Religious Essays*, or for some other future work. “Doktor Leisetritt,” meaning “Dr. Pussyfoot,” is an epithet that theologian Thomas Müntzer had applied to Martin Luther.

**Esaias Strandsand** – Danish for “Isaiah Beachsand.” Considered for a prospective piece entitled “*Pious Phrase Book* or Handbook for Pastors / Containing 500 platitudes / alphabetically arranged / by / A sexton who has been employed by all churches and therefore is well acquainted with platitudes.”

**Felix de St. Vincent** – “The lucky (or happy) one from St. Victor,” potential author of *Writing Sampler*, *Crisis*, and two other unpublished pieces, the four of which Kierkegaard considered publishing under the title “The Writings of a Young Man.”

**Simon Stylita** – So-called “Solo Dancer and Private Individual,” named after one (or more?) of three 5th–6th-century saints each named Simeon Stylites. Author of a provisional version of *Fear and Trembling* entitled *Between Each Other: Movements and Positions*.

**Victorinus Constantius de bona speranza** – Perhaps “victorious constancy of good hope,” and possibly named after 3rd-century martyr St. Victorinus of Pettau. Potential author of *Repetition*. (Walter Constantius was yet another.)

**Victorin Victorius Victor** – Associated with “*Ein, Zwei, Drei* / or Three Aphorisms,” incorporated into *The Moment* 6.1: “Brief and to the Point.”
