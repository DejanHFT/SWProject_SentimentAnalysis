Here I am writing the first post on this wonderful community subreddit!

I recently started a collective for creatives, and I thought this would be a great thing to share with any of you that would be interested in having their work featured somewhere and showcased online. I know the submission process is quite frustrating for a lot of mediums, so I thought that creating a place where we can share and talk about our work without feeling the competition was a nice idea.

This is where Le Freak Media comes in, I created an outlet where Iâ€™d love to showcase and let the artist talk about their work and their process behind it. I also made an IG account that goes with it, so if any of you would be interested in checking those out, this is where you can do it www. lefreakmedia .com , and the IG profile is lefreakmedia. 

Submissions can be done in english and italian, but if you send me the write out in italian, mind that i will have to translate it so i will send it back to you in english so that you can double check it and make sure everything is on there."
