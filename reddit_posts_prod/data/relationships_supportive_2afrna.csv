"Me [27 M] with my GF [25 F] of 5 years, not supportive of recent success?",Throwaway98552,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2afrna/me_27_m_with_my_gf_25_f_of_5_years_not_supportive/,40,20,"Hey /r/relationships, 

I was hoping to get some advice from everyone about something that happened last night. My girlfriend whom I love very much and I had a little issue. I should preface that she is generally supportive of me and I of her.  However, last night she wasn't very supportive of a recent ""win"" in my professional life and I'm curious from an outside perspective if I'm correct in feeling the way I do. 

Basically, I've been unhappy in my job for some time now. I work in IT sales and despite being one of the top reps for my company and making decent money, the stress and general disarray of the organization have lead me to nearly quit a few times now. But, I've been responsible and have just been looking for a new job. I've been worried that my general discontent had been noticed and was even prepared to get fired in coming weeks, so it's been a bit stressful. But, my girlfriend has been very supporting of my discontent. 

Well, yesterday I found out that my discontent *had* been noticed. My CEO pulled me aside and offered me a 25% raise on my base pay. Which is a 5 figure raise and something that will help out significantly financially. Needless to say, I was thrilled and excited to get praise and be told specifically that I was valued. This won't stop me from looking for another gig, but the financial recognition is awesome. I told a few family member and close friends and everyone was floored! I was feeling pretty good. 

Well, my live in GF, whom I should note owes me $3k from me helping her out recently when she quit her job wasn't exactly as excited as I'd expect. Sure, she said congrats, etc. But, after a few drinks she started to question whether or not I asked for more money. Telling me I should have, but not pushing too hard. I sort of blew it off and said that with the financial struggles the company has been having, I was satisfied with the 25% raise I was offered and would rather try to leverage this into more opportunities to work from home or flexible schedule instead of simply asking for more money. 

I thought it was done, but I noticed she was being a little short with me, given that we were supposedly celebrating. Maybe an hour or two later, she again brought it up and sort of hammered home that I should have asked for more money. It was under the umbrella of me being very good at my job and deserve to be compensated, etc. But, you could tell she was disappointed I didn't ask for more. 

She and I are planning on getting married and with some of her recent financial troubles (though she now has a new job) and my supporting her, buying a ring has been pushed back a bit. Once she heard about my raise she also made the point to show me some of the rings she likes, which I've seen before, but it was clear that hearing I'll be making more money got her thinking about it again. I know her end goal would be to be a stay at home mom (we don't have children now) and as she doesn't have a ""professional level"" job like I do, it's expected that at some point my earnings will carry us to that point. 

But, with some of the recent struggles and my unhappiness at my job. I was at least satisfied that I got some recognition and a hell of a raise to help us out in the short-term. The fact that her focus was on ""it's not good enough"" really hurt my pride and brought me from cloud 9 to questioning whether or not it will ever be good enough for her or if the constant need for money will only get worse as the years progress. She's always been a bit more materialistic than I am, but this is the first time I realized that may go beyond what I'm comfortable with. 

I do love my girlfriend, but I was pretty upset when my happiness over an unexpected win in my professional life was questioned as not being good enough. Finances are important and you have to maximize your potential, but honestly after feeling very stressed I was just happy to feel valued and get the bump I did. Is it wrong to expect my girlfriend to feel the same and share in my happiness for a night instead of questioning why I didn't get more? 

I'm now wondering how many different areas this will spill into and what the rest of our future looks like given her discontent. We'll need to talk about this tomorrow and I was hoping for some advice or outside perspective. 

Thanks for taking the time to read and help out!
