How to paint plastic chair like these ones and not make a mess?,MonsieurBouboule,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/15h68pg/how_to_paint_plastic_chair_like_these_ones_and/,9,0,"Hello, I bought two plastic chairs at a flee market recently but I want to paint them both, probably orange or maybe yellow.

I have never done such a thing, and I believe painting plastic may not be the easiest thing?

I want to use them for my living room so they have to look good. Do you have any tips on how to achieve a good result?
As you can maybe see from the photo, they are shiny or glossy or something and I‚Äôd like to achieve the same result but with a different color, if possible.

What paint to use? How to apply the paint (like, with a brush or something else would be better)? Should I use some sorte of afterpaint to obtain this shiny glossy finish? My goal is to mimic the kind of furniture they had in like the 70s, when they were using plastic for interior design and furnitures.
Sorry for my English, I‚Äôm French.

Thanks for your help! üôè"
