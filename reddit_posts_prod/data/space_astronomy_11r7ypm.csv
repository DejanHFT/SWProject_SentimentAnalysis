Why does it still feel like “outer space” is still such a niche and exclusive hobby?,EarthInteresting9781,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/11r7ypm/why_does_it_still_feel_like_outer_space_is_still/,504,1001,"Literally all my friends don’t care. My fiancé doesn’t care. My family doesn’t care.

Which is fine, I can’t make someone care about something they don’t have interest in. But I just find it how amusing how people could care less about the cosmos but care so much about materialistic things like the stock market or sports. 

I think it’s because space is still so far away. Probably none of us will ever actually go up in space in our life time (unless you have a spare 250-500k laying around for commercial space tourism)…so why care about outer space if it’s so unobtainable? 


Also, the cosmos field job positions are very limited and highly competitive. Unless your a chem and math and physics wiz it’s impossible to find a stable career in astronomy. So that kind of alienates a lot of people as well."
