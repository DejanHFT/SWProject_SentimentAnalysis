What are some of your favorite instances of historical pettiness or immaturity?,African_Watersports,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/alg6gf/what_are_some_of_your_favorite_instances_of/,112,161,"For example, I just read that after beating the Persians at Granicus in 334BCE, Alexander the Great shipped their officers’ intricate armor back to Athens for public display with the inscription:

“Alexander and All of the Greeks Helped to Crush the Barbarians- except the Spartans”

I find it incredible that caustic wit and impassioned pettiness existed over 2300yrs ago, showing how little we’ve changed"
