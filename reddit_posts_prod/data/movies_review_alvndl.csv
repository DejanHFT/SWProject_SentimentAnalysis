**Written Reviews:**

**[ScreenCrush - Matt Singer](https://screencrush.com/alita-battle-angel-review/)**

Alita barely considers any of the existential questions about humanity that are typically central to this kind of sci-fi film. It’s just a slick action film. That is one way, at least, it does feel like a Robert Rodriguez movie.

**[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/31/alita-battle-angel-review-robert-rodriguez)**

Alita: Battle Angel is a film with Imax spectacle and big effects. But for all its scale, it might end up being put on for 13-year-olds as a sleepover entertainment. It doesn’t have the grownup, challenging, complicated ideas of Ghost in the Shell.

**[Empire - Dan Jolin](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/alita-battle-angel/review/)**

Best enjoyed for the fun, slick action and the astonishing, super-expressive realisation of Alita herself, because elsewhere it’s cyberpunk business as usual, marred by some sloppy plotting.

**[TheWrap - Nicholas Barber](https://www.thewrap.com/alita-battle-angel-film-review-robert-rodriguez-james-cameron/)**

The film is stuffed with so many plot strands and so many different genres (sports movie, YA rebellion movie, bounty-hunter movie) that it never gets moving.

**[The Telegraph - Tim Robey](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/alita-battle-angel-review-cyborg-blockbuster-bolted-together/)**

As you’d expect from Rodriguez, it has a decent number of pow-wow fight scenes, and sure loves to watch machinery being ripped to shreds. But it's all uncomfortably close to the gruesome Flesh Fair from Spielberg’s A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, revamped as an ain’t-it-cool demolition derby with a charm-and-conscience bypass."
