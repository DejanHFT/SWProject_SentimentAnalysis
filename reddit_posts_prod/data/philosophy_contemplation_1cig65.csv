Why life and death baffle me,Komania,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1cig65/why_life_and_death_baffle_me/,52,12,"I was nonexistent for an infinite amount of time. I will be nonexistent for an infinite amount of time. Somewhere within infinity I exist. But why am I in existence, and why did infinity break to allow my existence? When I die, is it infinite nonexistence, or will it form like a circle and give into life once again?


I suppose this brings about another question: what is life? Is life consciousness or sentience? What is consciousness? I experience, but I cannot comprehend what is occurring or it's origin.

What am I? What is self? Am I simply a collection of cells? If these cells keep getting replaced, then is it the DNA that defines self? In that case, given infinite time, is it possible that my DNA would occur again? Would I exist again in that case? Would that person be me, or is there more to existence than the material world? 

I'm going mad contemplating these questions. I know there are no answers, but I'm just looking for some discussion."
