The Avengers spoiler filled discussion; critiques are welcome,DocxVenture,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/t6jb8/the_avengers_spoiler_filled_discussion_critiques/,1187,213,The Avengers was awesome. Any complaint I have is about tiny details but overall I thought all the primary characters got ample screen time. If I were to nitpick I would say there was too much Black Widow and not enough Hawkeye.
