"So with the concept of beginners gains in mind, does that apply to under trained muscles as well?",kul_kids,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8k1adp/so_with_the_concept_of_beginners_gains_in_mind/,41,8,"Understandably beginners hit a huge growth spurt when they first begin with muscle growth. My question is, does the same concept apply to muscles that were undertrained?

Example: I had a nasty shoulder injury in the military, which led me to not be able to do as much work on my shoulders as I could have, although I have been lifting for about 4 years now. Now that i feel it's safe enough to start training them with the same intensity as other muscle regions, would i still get the effect of beginners gains, in terms of fast muscle growth in comparison to my already trained groups?"
