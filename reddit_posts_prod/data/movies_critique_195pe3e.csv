Anyone else get irrationally annoyed by 'its not like the book!' people?,K1ng_Canary,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/195pe3e/anyone_else_get_irrationally_annoyed_by_its_not/,443,137,"My father in law recently told me that Children of Men is a rubbish film. When I asked what he didn't like about it, it was essentially that it wasn't the exact same as the book- things happened in the film that weren't in the book and things happened on the book that weren't in the film.

I've heard this criticism about multiple films/TV shows (the Shining, Game of Thrones etc etc) and I always find it really irritating. Film is a different medium, you can't just wholesale lift the book and turn it into a film. You have to make changes in order to fit. 

I'm not saying you have to love an adaptation of your favourite book but if your only critique is that a particular plot point is different to the source material then I don't see it as valid.

Is it just me?"
