Unemployed husband for 2 years. 31 [F] 38 [M]. How do you stay supportive and happy?,ReceptionFar890,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/r3855u/unemployed_husband_for_2_years_31_f_38_m_how_do/,153,171,"31 female and husband is 38

Married 5 years.  No kids 

Husband left his job 2 years ago as it was too stressful.

He went on multiple “solo” trips which I paid for.

He complains i do not cook or clean enough (he cooks once a week sometimes, I cook 2-3 times a week but he thinks it’s horrible food and does not eat it)

I will admit - he does cook *sometimes* and he’s good and he does help with cleaning and is great about doing laundry. 

He gets angry and upset if I don’t pay for us to go on vacations

He needs a lot of attention. If I want to spend 1 hour after work going to work out while he is having an “off day” - I am told I have 0 empathy and don’t know how to show care

He has avoided visiting my parents for 2 years

He did not open 1 job link I sent

He is now helping a friend with his start up. Not getting paid.

If I do anything “wrong” or don’t give him The attention he likes (he thinks couples should hang out every night) (not intimidate though) then I am selfish, and un empathetic.

We have tried counseling yet i think he is depressed and taking out his insecurities on me.

He also says things like he hates “feisty women” and thinks they are very unattractive. This is his way of getting me to not nag/insist on things.

I’m at a loss. I want to help him but I don’t know how and I am starting to question the relationship and I would like to have kids soon but I don’t want to live life this way. What do you all think? 

TLDR: husband hasn’t had a real job in 2 + years and he can be emotionally abusive and I’m 32 and want to have kids but am too scared to do so with him."
