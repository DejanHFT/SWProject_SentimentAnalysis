"Do you guys write novel from beginning to end? Or ""out of sequence"" based on inspiration as it hits you? Pros and cons?",AoiYagami,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/16iqscb/do_you_guys_write_novel_from_beginning_to_end_or/,63,50,"Basically the title.

Some background. Im getting back into writing but only wrote short stories in college. When I attempted to write longer pieces of fiction, I usually wrote it beginning to end with no real outline which eventually leads me to losing steam and getting nowhere. Part of how i lose drive is that there are scenes or plot points I want to get to immediately and just write that. But maybe I would be disorganized? Not sure. 

Advice?"
