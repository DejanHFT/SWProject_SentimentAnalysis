"Learn programming for free, with an eco-responsible touch?",Yozamu,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/192b7oc/learn_programming_for_free_with_an_ecoresponsible/,0,1,"Hello,  
  
I have been developing an eco-responsible programming learning platform called iTeach for several months, focusing on four core values: interactivity, free nature, ecology, and confidentiality. Today is not the day for advertising, so I won't be sharing any link (unless you are really interested, then you can DM me so I can send you some link to Discord, social networks, or to the website itself). Instead, I'd like to gather some thoughts about such a project.  
  
The main courses will go throught web concepts, javascript and react, to allow one to start with no prior knowledge and be able to deploy applications in the end. In addition to designing a platform that is inherently eco-friendly, an entire course will be dedicated to eco-conception, bringing two major positive effects:  
  
⇒ Future-developed applications will be designed with a stronger consideration for ecology.  
⇒ Learners can distinguish themselves from other profiles with their still relatively rare knowledge.  
  
The goal I aim to achieve is to gauge the interest that the project can generate and eventually raise funds through a crowdfunding campaign to take this project as far as possible. Having already conducted such a campaign in the past, but for an entirely different field, I know that it is possible to rally support for worthwhile ideas, and I hope that this one will fall into that category for you."
