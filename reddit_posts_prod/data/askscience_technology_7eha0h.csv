"Hein et al (2017) have explored scenarios for sending a spacecraft to the recently confirmed interstellar asteroid ""Oumuamua"". What payloads and capabilities would we wish to prioritize on the exploration of this strange and peculiar object?",Gargatua13013,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7eha0h/hein_et_al_2017_have_explored_scenarios_for/,353,3394,"Reference: [Hein, Andreas M., et al.

And, to keep everybody's hopes up, allow me to highlight the following quote: ""*It is concluded that although reaching the object is challenging, there seem to be viable options based on current and near term technology.*""

Can we get on board of this? Special shoutout to Redditors from JPL, ESA and other space agencies .... Any ideas?"
