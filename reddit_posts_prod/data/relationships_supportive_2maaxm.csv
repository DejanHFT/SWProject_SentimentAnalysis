"BF (30 M) of two years won't do anything (including shower) without my suggestion. I (28 F) want to be supportive, because of his past trauma, but I'm running out of patience.",idontwanttosayjump,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2maaxm/bf_30_m_of_two_years_wont_do_anything_including/,286,479,"I'm posting under a throwaway because I'm a regular here.


I've been with my boyfriend for two years now. He was in a string of abusive relationships before me, always with violent, controlling women. (Not me!)


Anyway, when we got together, I knew his history and I knew he was a quiet guy. But with me, he has always been fun and funny, and we became BFFs right away. I knew he would need time and patience to work through the traumatic stuff he'd been through before, but I figured it would give me time to ease into it too (my dating history wasn't stellar either). 


Well, fast-forward two years and he hasn't really kicked into gear. We live together now, and while he's perfectly willing to do anything I ask him to do, he doesn't do anything *until* I ask him to do it. But okay, I can live with that, at least he will help. 


He tends to be passive and insecure, but he's always respectful and loving. He just seems to have no real desire to do anything for himself, like he's always waiting for my approval. I've told him many times that he doesn't have to wait for my ""permission,"" but he still seems to just sit around, waiting for me to tell him what to do next.


If I don't offer to make food, he just won't eat. He doesn't complain - he will just wait indefinitely until I suggest it. Sex is great and we enjoy being intimate, but again - if I don't initiate it or suggest it, he will just wait until I say something. These things are a little annoying, but I don't mind too much. I try to give him opportunities to speak up and not micromanage him. I always just chalked it up to being with hyper-controlling women before.


Where this is causing some real problems is with hygiene. We have had numerous talks about it. I've made suggestions, set out cleaning stuff, made every concession. I've told him that I will be happy to do oral sex after he's good and clean. But he just won't very often, unless I remind him (and again, he's perfectly willing to do it if I suggest it.) If I say nothing, he doesn't take a shower more than once a week, and sometimes not for two weeks. And he brushes his teeth about as often. 


I'm at the end of being patient about it. I don't want to spend the rest of my life reminding him to take a shower. If he skips a meal, I figure he can be hungry. But if he skips a shower, it becomes my problem too. He's a great guy and my best friend, but I'm feeling more like a mom than a partner. 


I'm sure he would benefit from therapy, but every time I bring it up, he shrugs it off. Is it time to push him seriously into therapy, or should I give him more time/space?


Tl;dr BF won't jump if I don't say boo. It stinks."
