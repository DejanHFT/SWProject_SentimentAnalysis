What is actually going on in the brain when we imagine a rotated image?,i_love_the_funk,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/xvrgcf/what_is_actually_going_on_in_the_brain_when_we/,5,16,"This might be a bit of a weird question, but hopefully you can bear with me. From what I understand, AI image generators are based off of training a neural network on a whole bunch of images and then being able to recall bits of them and combine them into new images. This is supposed to be analogous to how our neurons work and how our imagination would draw from our memories to create new images.

So one thing I noticed was that it is easy to imagine an image, say an image of the letter A. It is also very easy to imagine it rotated 90 degrees so that it is sideways. However, it seems to me that AI image generators probably can't produce rotated versions of their memories. From what I understand the images are remembered all in specific orientations relative to each other, and so unless it was fed pictures of sideways A's there wouldn't be any way for it to derive rotated A's from images of upright A's.

I tried putting things like ""sideways letter A"", ""rotated letter A"", and ""letter A on its side"" in Dall-E, but it always only ever turned out A's the right way up. The closest I could get was ""tree on its side"", but that just made pictures of trees that had fallen over, not making a rotated picture out of an upright memory. I don't think there we need to have seen pictures of a sideways A or tree to imagine it.

Obviously our brain can recognize the edges between objects and some more advanced stuff, which I'd guess are also possible for neural networks if they were designed for it, but the only possibility for rotating images that I'm aware of is using abstract math. From what I understand, rotating an object is something that involves things like complex numbers, vectors, or linear algebra, so not the simplest kinds of math. I guess I have a hard time understanding how our brain could be doing math like that without us consciously being aware of it, or how something like that could evolve in the first place. It seems like you would need a pretty specific arrangement of neurons to act like logic gates to do more advanced math, which I don't think neural networks are capable of. If there is math like this going on, where is it happening?

There's probably a very obvious answer to this question, but I appreciate people humoring me."
