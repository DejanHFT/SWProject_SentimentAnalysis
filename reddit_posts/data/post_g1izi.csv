"My dad's losing it, can anyone help?",formydad,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g1izi/my_dads_losing_it_can_anyone_help/,404,468,"**A newly produced song: http://soundcloud.com/anthonykid/nicole-because-you-loved-me **

My dad has taken into consideration a lot of criticism and tried his best to incorporate all ideas into his latest mix. Thank you so much for the support reddit!

**UPDATE here's the SoundCloud link! I had it set to private but I fixed that so it should work for everyone now! Thanks for suggesting this! http://soundcloud.com/anthonykid/nicole-singing-true **

**Update 2: everyone loved the first song he produced for my sister, here's another: http://soundcloud.com/anthonykid/nicole-out-of-this-world **

I'll start off by saying that I'm a long time lurker, first time poster (I actually never made an account before now).

My dad is a supermarket manager at a regional supermarket chain (I don't want to say the name in case this somehow gets him in trouble). He started as a teenager packing out groceries to the shelves for his local supermarket of said chain when he was 16. In 4 or 5 years he worked his way up to store manager. So, since he was about 20 until now, (he's 45), he's been working as a supermarket store manager for this chain. They send him to the worst store in the area, have him fix it up, then send him to the next one (because he's very good at what he does).

The problem is that his job is slowly killing him. He hates it. He hates it so much he doesn't even like to talk about it. His bosses give him shit about everything and work him to the bone. He works 6 days a week for 13-14 hours. His blood pressure is continually rising, he's developing heart problems and he never sleeps from the stress.

The important part: my younger sister has the voice of an angel. There will be a link below to a cover she sang. My dad has been trying to get her ""noticed"" since she was let's say maybe 13.

But just recently he REALLY got into it - he's very musically talented and he's spent about $15k in the last year on recording equipment in an attempt to help my sister get a record deal or whatever.

What's really important is that in this process he's become an absolutely astounding producer. He can produce album quality material with sub-standard equipment. And now, it's basically become his dream - to produce.

After a 13 hour day of work he comes home and immediately goes down into his studio and spends the next 6-7 hours working on perfecting songs my sister has sang and researching how to get great vocals and the best equipment for each scenario. Then he gets maybe 1-2 hours of sleep on the couch and goes to work again.

So what I'm asking is if anyone on reddit has any ties to anyone important in the music industry that they could maybe get him a job or at least a shot at a job being a music producer. He is really good. I mean damn good. Again a link of a cover song he produced for my sister (it's karaoke of course in the background but anyone who knows a lot about music production knows how hard it is to get perfect vocals and he's gotten really good at this).

If nothing else, does anyone on LI want some music produced? Really any opportunities will count here. My dad needs a change. He needs to be a producer or at least be involved in something musically important.

edit: took pics out, they werent relevant idk why i put them sorry

For what it's worth, he has an Avedis MA5 preamp, a Buzz elixir (I believe) compressor, and a custom $1300 microphone and he uses Logic Pro 9.

*Edit: thanks for the responses: here's a link to soundcloud: http://soundcloud.com/anthonykid/nicole-singing-true

thanks for whoever put that up there

**edit 2: still nothing particularly helpful or any opportunities but many very great comments and good advice.**

**to anyone saying ""why bother it's impossible to make it"" im sorry i just cant tell my dad that. he already basically knows that, any further pessimism will just be a slap in the face.**

If anyone is interested in more from my dad, please message me and I'll gladly send an e-mail you can ask him for more!"
