"r/Music, what is your favorite uplifting/feel good music?",swedish0spartans,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/z5kzf/rmusic_what_is_your_favorite_upliftingfeel_good/,28,6,"People of r/Music, share with me your favorite music (preferable pop/techno or something in that kind) that really makes you uplifted or makes you feel good.
I know that this has been asked before, but in my post, I am adding in that these musics will preferably be pop/techno kind. The musics can come from where ever, such as a series, an movie, a game, an ost or even simply a song."
