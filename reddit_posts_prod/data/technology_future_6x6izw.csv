"Guys, México has no net neutrality laws. This is what it really looks like. No mockup, glimpse into a possible future for the US. (Image in post)",ophcourse,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6x6izw/guys_méxico_has_no_net_neutrality_laws_this_is/,3230,41695,"Firstoff, I absolutely support Net Neutrality Laws. 

[Here's a screencapture for cellphone data plans in México](http://imgur.com/yYobj7x), which show how carriers basically discriminate data use based on which social network you browse/consume.

I wanted to post this here because I keep finding all these mockups about how Net Neutrality ""might look"" which -albeit correct in it's assumptions- get wrong the business model end of what companies would do with their power.

Basically, what the mockups show... a world where ""regular price for top companies vs pay an extra if you're a small company"", non-net neutral competition in México is actually based on who gives away more ""free app time"". Eg: ""You can order 3 Uber rides for free, no data use, with us!""

Which I guess makes more sense. The point is still the same though... ISPs are looking inside your data packets to make these content discrimination decisions.
