One year of travel and adventure,priofind,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/xhn59i/one_year_of_travel_and_adventure/,10,0,"I'm starting from scratch. I have only been to 10 countries in my life so far. I'm going to be taking a year off before I start a big change in my career after which I will have zero time for a decade due to work and life. This is the last time I will be single, no kids, have time, and money. So I want to make the best use of this one year and squeeze as much life out of it as possible.

I'm looking for adventure, urban travel, and to check off life-time bucket list items. I want to  ride a motorcycle across a country, trek to the South Pole, scuba in Great Barrier Reef, see lions on a safari, get lost in the markets of Marrakesh, party in Berlin, read in a Parisian cafe, Carnival in Rio, eat food in Asia.

How do I get started? Any general tips on how I should go about researching, things I should keep in mind, any travel resources, or people that have done something similar? I have a few months to plan this. Budget is not a problem."
