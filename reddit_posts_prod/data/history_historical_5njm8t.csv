Has a King ever killed another King in the midst of a major historical battle?,kewfuhlio,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5njm8t/has_a_king_ever_killed_another_king_in_the_midst/,267,621,"Posted this a few days ago in /r/askhistorians but it got booted out for being an example seeking question. In general, I am wondering about any instances where someone of note/importance like a General, well-known nobleman, artist, writer, leader, etc., has ever personally killed someone else of a similar status/renown within the context of a major military engagement. This would refer exclusively to something like this occurring in heat of battle, as opposed to in the aftermath as execution, in a duel, etc."
