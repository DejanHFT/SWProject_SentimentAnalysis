Adventure-seeking Trio in Their 30s: Recommendations for Travel Companies & Hiking Destinations 🏔️🧗,flying_seaman,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/12mv2h0/adventureseeking_trio_in_their_30s/,5,0,"Hey fellow travelers! 👋

My two friends and I, all guys in our mid-30s, are eager to embark on an unforgettable adventure vacation. We're on the lookout for a reputable travel company that specializes in organizing small group trips for younger people like us.

We've been considering hiking in the stunning Lofoten Islands, for example, but we're also open to other destinations that offer equally captivating experiences. 🏞️

We're based in the Netherlands, so we're interested in agencies that offer trips starting from here. However, it's essential that the tour be conducted in English. 🇳🇱🌍

If you have any recommendations or experiences to share, please let us know:

- Trustworthy travel companies that cater to our demographic and interests 🗺️
- Memorable adventure destinations that you've loved, especially if they involve hiking 🥾
- Any tips or advice for planning a trip like this ⚠️

Thank you so much for your help! We can't wait to hear your suggestions and kick off our planning. 🛫

Happy travels, everyone! 🌏"
