Writing a story on my own for once without help from my characters nor inspiration.,Apprehensive_Ad93,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/15hexe4/writing_a_story_on_my_own_for_once_without_help/,5,0,"I'm a writer and other than having the problem of starting something and not finishing it, I've realized that I have trouble coming up with stories.

What I am is if I get hit with inspiration I can write for hours non stop. This is how I'll usually write to work on a novel or project. I have forcing myself to write. When I do I have trouble writing or it takes me a while to come up with something interesting or continue the story. 

Recently I've discovered I've never come up with a story on my own. It's either always been because something inspired me or the characters told me what to write. Now that neither or those have happened and I need a story for this paid project, for the first time ever I have to cime up with it on my own. Thus this feels like 'my' story, as in I'm writing it and the characters aren't telling me what to write. In fact the characters haven't said a thing to me. And I don't know if that means the story is 'lifeless'. I'm having to put conscious thought into every single thing. Inspiration has not fully hit more once. It's more like 'oh these concepts might work together'

I've got a (shaky?) foundation down. But other than short term ideas I have a blurry view of the rest of the story.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? Is this normal? I've never started a story on my own, without inspiration, and definitely not without imput from the characters. Normally I'm the scribe for the characters' story not the conductor.

Thoughts? Advice? Suggestions?

(Note: This is also why I find freelance writing hard. Not that I've ever done it.)"
