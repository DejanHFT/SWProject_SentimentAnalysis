"If I'm achieving my calorie and protein goals, do the other macros matter?",Thranrond,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8ctiwl/if_im_achieving_my_calorie_and_protein_goals_do/,21,12,"20yo M here. I'm currently lean bulking (2600 kcals daily) and pretty much always go over eating 30% fat (90g) whilst not getting 50% (337g) carbs. How much extra fat I eat ranges from 10g-50g, according to myfitnesspal.

I also have a huuuuge sweet tooth and I do my best to stay healthy but *always* eat more sugar than what MFP tells me to (up to 100g more sometimes).

I had a blood test done recently and everything came up as healthy like glucose, cholesterol, all my vitamins, etc, etc.

If I'm eating the right amount of calories and getting the right amount of protein, will the other macros affect my ability to build muscle?"
