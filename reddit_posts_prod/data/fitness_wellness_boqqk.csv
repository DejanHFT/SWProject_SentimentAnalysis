Trying to start a wellness program at work and have a few questions for people that may have something similar at their offices.,brivera,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/boqqk/trying_to_start_a_wellness_program_at_work_and/,5,6,"I've been trying to get a corporate wellness program going where I work at for quite some time but have been shot down in the past (mainly because the person in charge of HR didn't want to do more work).  As of recently, there have been a considerable amount of changes going on at work including the acquisition of a few different companies under one parent company and the hiring of a new HR manager so I decided to bring up the wellness program again to her but would like to come in prepared and have a well thought out plan of attack.  I know that wellness programs exist out there at a lot of places and was just wondering what type of things they offer besides the obvious gym membership assistance.  From a companies stand point, what are the benefits to having a wellness program in place?  I have heard that insurance rates are lowered but does anyone know off hand if that's true? "
