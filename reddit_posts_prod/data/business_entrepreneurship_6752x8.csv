Advice for a teen with aspirations in entrepreneurship,Tydier,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/6752x8/advice_for_a_teen_with_aspirations_in/,0,2,"I'm currently a high school student with aspirations of going into business.

I've heard opinions from different people and none of them seem to lead to one solid answer. While some say I should take advantage of having low-risk to start something, others argue that patience and the traditional route of education is the way to go. 

Anyone have any suggestions? I greatly appreciate it.






On the side note, I'd love to connect with some other teens to discuss similar interests. Send me a pm if you're interested!"
