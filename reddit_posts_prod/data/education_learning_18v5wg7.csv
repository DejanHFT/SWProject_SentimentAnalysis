Coping with the fact that I feel I’ve lost the opportunity to properly learn complex subjects,pifthy,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/18v5wg7/coping_with_the_fact_that_i_feel_ive_lost_the/,4,4,"This is just a rant but I feel I’ve lost my opportunity on learning things like math, chemistry, and physics properly. Much of this stuff was taught in specifics only around 11th grade, and that’s when COVID hit and I clocked out during online school. The blame is on me, and I just feel so stupid for neglecting these subjects. While self teaching is possible, I always have this nagging thought that I’m doing it extremely inefficiently. Learning it in university for the first time is so hard for me personally as many profs just have that “you should know this from HS” expectation (which is fair) and the speed is much too fast for me. I just feel like I’m missing out on a huge aspect of our world and it’s hard to accept that sometimes. That’s all."
