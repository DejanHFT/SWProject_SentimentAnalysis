Looking for suggestions: European cities best explored on a scooter.,sk8erbhai,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17okj9f/looking_for_suggestions_european_cities_best/,2,3,"So I had a silly idea. The idea being riding around a pretty coastal city on a scooter, hopping from beach to beach, taking in the vibe.

The only condition is that I can rent a scooter with a Car DL. I dont have a license to drive a scooter but here in Poland, one can drive a 125cc scooter if they have a Car DL."
