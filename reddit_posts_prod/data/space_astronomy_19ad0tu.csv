Known Space / Astronomy YouTube Channels made with AI to Avoid?,Skatora,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/19ad0tu/known_space_astronomy_youtube_channels_made_with/,89,93,"I love watching space and astronomy YouTube videos, but I only want to support ""real"" creators (like SEA, Cool Worlds, or Dr. Becky). I recently watched Kyle Hill's video on AI-channels that steal or fabricate content, and now I'm terrified of watching new-to-me science YouTube channels because they could be fraudulent. 

I'm hoping you fine people can deinfluence me: do you know of known YouTube channels that are made using AI / stolen content that I should avoid? 

Thanks!!"
