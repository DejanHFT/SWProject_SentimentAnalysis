Why can't (or why don't) we use the concept of natural selection to evolve Artificial Intelligence?,rickroy37,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/m6i8f/why_cant_or_why_dont_we_use_the_concept_of/,10,3,"Is it possible to use the concept of natural selection to create an artificial intelligence?  As an example, what I'm thinking of is maybe something along the lines of [Cleverbot](http://cleverbot.com/), where we start with some basic communicating program, except the users have to give a positive or negative vote for each of the program's responses.  A random change is introduced into the program.  If the votes become more negative, the change is reverted (similar to a genetic mutation that dies off).  If the votes become more positive or stay the same, the change is kept (similar to a genetic mutation that is advantageous or genetic drift).  Random changes would continue to be introduced and voted on.

The idea is that users will generally give positive votes to intelligent or funny answers.  By opening the program up to lots of users, the program would have lots of opportunities to see which changes work and which changes don't.  Since we wouldn't have to wait for biological reproduction, intelligence could be selected for much quicker in AI than it was for humans.  I guess maybe this would actually be artificial selection instead of natural selection, but you get the idea.

Would something like this work?  Has anyone ever tried to evolve AI?"
