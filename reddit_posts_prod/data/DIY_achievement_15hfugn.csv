Help with painting French doors,Perfect-Vanilla-2650,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/15hfugn/help_with_painting_french_doors/,0,2,"So we had French doors put on this spring and we’re told that only had primer so they needed to be painted. Thanks to Tim-the-toolman-Taylor over here, it currently has a very blotchy coat of oil based black paint (Rustoleum “door paint”). I know I need to sand it and give it another coat of something but the rustoleum was very streaky and doesn’t look as glossy as I would like it. So is there any product out there that I can use to achieve the look I’m going for? I was thinking enamel spray paint since spray won’t streak but I don’t know if sprays are the route for a high glossy finish or what. I want to stay oil-based so I don’t have to prime again. Also, professionals have quoted me way more than I can afford at the moment so please keep your suggestions DIY oriented. 
Thank you."
