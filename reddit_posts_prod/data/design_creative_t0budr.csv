Organizing your creative assets,akonomika,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/t0budr/organizing_your_creative_assets/,3,1,"Hi designers, I'm a product manager of a new startup aimed at designers, and looking to deepen my understanding of the unique issues creative teamsÂ face.Â Would really appreciate your insight about a few questions.

I know that many of you use stock-photo websites for designs. These sites are search- & filter-based, but then I see many companies keeping their own assets (photos, illustrations, etc.) on dropbox or something similar, which seems really inefficient. Is that really how most designers work? Does it cause issues, and if so, how bad are they?

We're basically looking to build a tool that can create an in-house stock-photo website with your own assets (using AI because 2022). Would that be at all helpful? Do you think your company would implement such a solution?

I'd also love to hear of any challenges relating to creative asset management in teams. This is your stage to complain!
