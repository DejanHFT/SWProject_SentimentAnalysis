G Adventures: Is it worth it?,skillao,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/udim5k/g_adventures_is_it_worth_it/,55,35,"Hey everyone! I've been considering booking a trip through G Adventures to go to India/Nepal or Egypt sometime later this year. I've heard mixed things about them. I know that I could do these countries cheaper booking my trips on my own, but as a solo woman, I've been advised to do a tour to these places. 

So to those who have used this company, please share your thoughts and experiences (good and bad). I have also heard that Intrepid Travel is pretty good, so if you've got anything to say about them, please let me know!

Thanks in advance!!"
