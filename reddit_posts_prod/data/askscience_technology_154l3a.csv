"After hearing the news about the ""habitable"" planet 12 light years away, I'm curious to know how long it would take us to get there given today's technology.",Unlucky13,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/154l3a/after_hearing_the_news_about_the_habitable_planet/,666,1358,"I'm referring to this report: http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/dec/19/habitable-planet-discovered-tau-ceti

If we were to send some kind of probe or satellite or even a lander of some kind, how long would it take us to 

1) get something there

2) begin receiving data on that objects findings

Obviously it would take 12 years at the speed of light, and we're no where near capable of reaching those speeds (right?). "
