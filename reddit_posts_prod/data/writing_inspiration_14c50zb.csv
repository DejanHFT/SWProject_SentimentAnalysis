help Inspiration vs Desire,Stolidrain,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/14c50zb/help_inspiration_vs_desire/,8,2,"What I wanted to ask is what advice people would have when it comes to writing science fiction. (For plotting and avoiding tired troupes)

I love reading science fiction. It's definitely my favorite genre to read. The deep sociological issues and other questions the writer poses to the reader always excite me.

But as far as writing, all my inspiration goes towards characters, fantasy, and business. 

I can go on forever about a father son dynamic, or someone trying to strike it rich. But when I want to write about science fiction, I feel like any good idea is plagiarism.

Everyone has written a first encounter book, what would set mine apart? If I want to make a cyborg, how is he not any other cyborg struggling to maintain their humanity? People advance technology, and it has consequences, but personally I feel like we don't have a good understanding about the consequences of our current technology.

If I could write a story that really scrutinized our relationship with social media, entertainment, and the connectivity we have with the internet right now. How would I do that in a Science fiction setting without exaggerating the issue or turning it into some ""shrug-it-off"" comedy?

I write a lot, but it feels like I'm missing something important, and my writing ends up getting sidetracked as I pants the story in another direction."
