> Any fears that the further Disneyfication of Pixar would result in the diminution of the latter's foundational franchise are put to rest at once in Toy Story 4, an entirely wonderful continuation of the series that 24 years ago launched a new era in the annals of animation. It's been nearly a decade since Toy Story 3 put a satisfying capper on what seemed likely to remain a trilogy, but the same level of wit, imagination and, yes, magic has been summoned to create yet another fully worthy sibling.

> Toy Story” ushered in the era of computer-animated cartoon features, and the fourth movie wraps up the saga beautifully. At least, for now.

[Peter Deburge - Variety \(SPOILERS\)](https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/toy-story-4-review-1203241658/)

> Toy Story 4 is an unnecessary franchise extension savvy enough for self-criticism: What is Woody still doing here?

[Darren Frainch - Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movie-reviews/2019/06/13/toy-story-4-review/?)

> Thus, Woody’s journey of self-actualization and acceptance in Toy Story 4 is both gratifying and shocking, the latter precisely because it’s gratifying at all. The improbability of the Toy Story franchise, which inexplicably has not soured with age, comes to a sweet, emotionally apt conclusion now with a fine capper on a generally perfect series.

[Josh Spiegel - Slashfilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/toy-story-4-review/)

> With this third sequel to Toy Story, Pixar has gotten away with pushing its own expiration date on the series. But those tiny spork tines won’t hold it together much longer. It’s time to get lost.

[Scott Tobias - The Verge

> ”Toy Story 4 ” is a blast and it’s great to be back with the gang. Let this be a lesson to all franchise cynics: Sometimes more is actually good. Woody needed some closure he couldn’t even comprehend. And, it turns out, so did we.

[Lindsey Bahr - Asscociated Press](https://apnews.com/e81c6ab996d949d69f656a324b51326f)

> Pixar could easily retire this series with a clean sweep of films that have been lovely to look at and moving and funny to watch. But if they can maintain this level of wonderful, keep ‘em coming.

[Alonso Durade - The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/toy-story-4-film-review-2019-pixar-keanu-reeves/)

> Toy Story 4 is a breezier affair, up to and including an ending that feels a few hankies shy of full tearjerker, landing on a note of conclusion that the movie barely seems to pretend will really hold this time. Yet the relatable insecurity the series has always located in its pint-sized heroes—the quality that makes them more human than the humans they worship, regardless of what their manufacturing stamps read—worms its way into every stray crack and crevice of the G-rated material. Toy Story, in other words, remains a uniquely existential crowd-pleaser. In this case, it’s also a pretty strange one, co-headlined as it is by a utensil with a death wish. We’re not in Andy’s room anymore.

[A.A. Dowd - The A.V. Club](https://film.avclub.com/toy-story-4-is-the-breeziest-but-also-the-strangest-ent-1835490558)

> Turns out, Pixar’s sentient toys can still make us cry: Nearly 25 years after their cinematic debut, the sweetly selfless plastic pals return in a fourth Toy Story, one charged by the animated series’ thematic essence of finding purpose in being useful to others. It’s a hopeful, immensely human chapter that echoes the franchise’s complex notions of loyalty, displacement and self-worth, doing so with humor and warmth.

[Tomris Laffly - Time Out](https://www.timeout.com/us/film/toy-story-4)

> Toy Story 4” takes a step back and forces Woody to re-evaluate his own sense of frontier justice. Yes, he was manufactured for the love that he has to give. But he’s only alive because of the love that he’s received in return.


[David Ehrlich - Indiewire

>  Toy Story 4 is a must-see for fans of Pixar, especially fans of this franchise - even those who thought Toy Story 3 was the perfect capper to the series. In fact, Toy Story 4 proves to be a much more compelling conclusion, while still leaving the door open for future adventures.

[Molly Freeman - Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/toy-story-4-movie-reviews/)

> Toy Story 4 is for everyone – the whole family. It’s these movies that I will continue to support and rally behind, because we need more of them. Movies that I can share with my teens and preschoolers. That’s real talent when you can write stories that span a wide range of ages without inserting shock humor or profane language. 

[Tania Lamb - Lola Lambchops](https://lolalambchops.com/is-toy-story-4-kid-friendly/)

>  Toy Story 4 is the weakest movie in the series. But it's also the riskiest and the most pleasantly unpredictable.

[Matt Singer - Screencrush](https://screencrush.com/toy-story-4-review/)

> The fourth entry is a worthy addition to the Toy Story library, bringing back some of the most beloved characters in the history of animated film and introducing us to a fantastically entertaining new bunch of toys — some of them adorable and huggable, some of them more reminiscent of a certain type of creepy, old-school doll usually seen in R-rated horror films. 

[Richard Roeper - Chicago Sun-Times

> The first three Toy Story films are about as perfect as a trilogy gets. They’re legendary, landmark films that changed the animation art form as we know it. So, the mere notion of a Toy Story 4 felt superfluous. A foolhardy, insurmountable task to continue and build upon that wonderful story. Could it be done? Should it be done? Turns out, the answer is abso-freakin-lutely.

[Germain Lussier - io9](https://io9.gizmodo.com/toy-story-4-is-a-heartwarming-boundary-pushing-additio-1835436414)

> The Toy Story series has always been just as satisfying for adults as for kids, but this might be the first film that actually feels more relatable to the grown-ups, offering a surprisingly nuanced tale of coping with change and moving on after loss. While Toy Story 3 felt like the perfect ending for these characters, Toy Story 4 offers an unexpected epilogue that’s just as meaningful as the films that came before it. It may not have been necessary, but somehow, it still feels right.

[Laura Prudom - IGN
](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/13/toy-story-4-review?sf103958058=1)

> Toy Story 4 is easily the series’ best-looking entry yet, playing with new, radioactive color palettes in characters like Bunny (Jordan Peele) and Ducky (Keegan-Michael Key), a pair of maniacal stuffed animals at the carnival. With the Canadian action figure Duke Caboom (Keanu Reeves), Pixar makes life in plastic look fantastic and almost tangible. 

[Alex Abad-Santos - Vox

> It’s a relief, then, that Toy Story 4 not only delivers plenty of gonzo-funny moments and genuine thrills, but also interrogates and complicates the series’s core themes.

[Richard Lawson - Vanity Fair
](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/13/toy-story-4-review?sf103958058=1)

> The Toy Story franchise isn’t over and done with (a Forky spinoff series is coming to Disney Plus), but if this film is the last chapter we get, it’s the perfect ending.

[Karen Han - Polygon

> It may only be a repeat of earlier ideas and plotlines, but compare it to the fourth films in other franchises and Pixar’s latest is an amusing and charming gem

[Peter Bradshaw - Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/13/toy-story-4-review-new-characters-same-old-story-pixar?)

> This fourth Toy Story isn’t as essential as the previous films in the series, but there’s no denying the joy of seeing Woody and friends back in action, while once again it’ll likely leave you with a tear in your eye.

[Dan Jolin - Empire
](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/toy-story-4/review/)

> This may not always feel like classic Toy Story, but perhaps that's the point. If the last film gave us the happy ending of a cycle starting all over again — Woody and the gang ready to love and be loved by another new child — this one asks if that cycle is truly all there is. Toy Story 4's purpose, in the end, is to help you find yours.
