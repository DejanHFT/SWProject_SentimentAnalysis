Would studying history in reverse chronological order have any value?,Babajang,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/gzx1j4/would_studying_history_in_reverse_chronological/,17,10,"My thinking is that if I start from, say, 1980s cold war era world history and work my backwards to ancient Greece over a couple of years, my perspective and relatibility might be different enough to gather new insights compared to a starting point thousands of years ago where I have very little frame of reference.

Anyone else approached history like this?"
