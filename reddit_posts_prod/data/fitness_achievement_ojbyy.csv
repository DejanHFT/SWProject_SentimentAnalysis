"Finally got my Human Flag on video. Not perfect, but I'm proud of my achievement!",InAnIndianAccent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ojbyy/finally_got_my_human_flag_on_video_not_perfect/,53,80,"[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIa9ZBFTB18) *[Warning: Your speakers are loud enough already.]*

This was the first time I saw it for myself, and have corrected the bent-arm at the top. Still, not bad for three months in. My record is 11 seconds on one side, but since results vary depending on the day, it was considerably less this time.

I don't claim to be an expert, but here are some tips that I found worked for me.

- I train the flag not more than once a week; twice on each side. I initially tried the grease-the-groove technique, flagging twice a day, but I didn't progress at all for two weeks.
- Requires more oblique strength than I initially had. Begun training them two months back.
- I did a lot of side planks (went from holding a side plank from 1 min to 3 mins).
- Windshield vipers, suspended from a bar, in flat tucked lever position, if that makes any sense.
- I didn't do any of the 'progressions', finding them more difficult than just jumping to it.
- The flag is seemingly more technique and your ability to activate the right muscles than pure strength. Mind-muscle connection is of utmost importance.
- Best way to increase flag time is to do negatives, where you jump your feet up really high, almost vertical, and then slowly come down. No point trying to learn pulling yourself up; that's just too taxing.

That's all."
