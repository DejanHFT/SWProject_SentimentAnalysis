Should I minor in business or entrepreneurship,mitchk98,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/b8zkmo/should_i_minor_in_business_or_entrepreneurship/,2,1,"I am currently a second semester sophomore in college majoring in Biology and a minor in chemistry. I trying to decide what my other minor should be as I have extra space. I have always been interested in starting my own business from the ground up but it would be on the side while my main job would be in biology. 

I have taken accounting and micro Econ leaving me with 12 hours left in a business minor. I’m interested in a entrepreneurship minor but I have no classes towards it yet and it’s 18 hours, 6 more for me than regular business. The classes do not line up between the 2 minors. Is it worth switching to entrepreneurship?"
