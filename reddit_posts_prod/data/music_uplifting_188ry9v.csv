Upbeat/positive protest songs?,drinkmorewater77,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/188ry9v/upbeatpositive_protest_songs/,115,45,"Can you think of any famous war protest songs that carry positive or uplifting messages? I'm thinking along the lines of ""This Land is Your Land"" by Woody Guthrie and ""We Shall Overcome"" by Pete Seeger. Any other ideas?"
