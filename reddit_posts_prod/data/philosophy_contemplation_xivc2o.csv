I hope you can give me feedback, the text was translated really fast, so if there are flaws don't take them into count.

**of internet suicides and saints**

The idea of suicide in Cioran serves as an interpretive means for understanding suicide in digital spaces

**The hermeneutics of tears:**

Cioran's work is born from the desolation and abjection provided by the experience that can only be summed up as finding oneself on the peaks of despair. From the hermeneutics of tears, which is the interpretation of the phenomenological features of despair, it is possible for Cioran ""to understand the peaks of history and dispense with the «events» (...) to rise above oneself "" (Cioran, p.23, 1937). It is in the internalization of fear, obsession, and pain where the necessary lucidity is acquired to reconfigure the way in which we experience the world, this new way of interpreting the world leads us to the rejection of the absolute and the glimpse of the emptiness of me and god

In the void, the ordinary temporary experience that is a mere illusion ends, it also culminates with the longing for the lost paradise and the meaning of the actions. This experience of emptiness is achieved through the ecstasy that is the result of absolute exhaustion, this boredom is typical of enduring life as it manifests as illness and anguish. In Cioran's words "" we understand death as an excess of life"". (1936, p.254) This inner place of complete emptiness is reached through defeat, the realization of one's worthlessness, and empty victories. The longing for the lost paradise refers to an idyllic state, where life did not arouse any concern, where knowledge remained forbidden and foreign (Cioran, 1940). From the beginning of the temporary experience, fear was fuel for the construction of the illusion whose purpose is to deceive man of existence, the illusion distances us from the absoluteness of the void and its expansion; establishes the delusion of the absolute. The illusion becomes knowledge in the sense of linguistic constructs that are the basis of alienation.

It is through wakefulness and insomnia that the necessary lucidity is acquired to conceive life outside the illusion of salvation, this conception is only possible in the face of the experience of one's own emptiness that refers to the emptiness of the world.

In cases like that of the saints, especially the martyrs who by default have for Cioran, an obsession with sin established and in the face of this obsession the understanding of life as condemnation and pain, suffering, a preparation for death is developed. In the irrational illusion where salvation from deception is experienced, the martyr loses his fear of death because of the boredom caused by his obsession with it. The saint's obsession with life easily becomes an obsession with sin and in turn in the recognition of his own sin, thus the martyr develops a thought against himself and in favor of the world. He understands that his death through self-sacrifice is a means of deliverance from sin.

In this way, pain and illness become inexhaustible sources that feed a void that trains the person in the experience of non-being and thus the fear of death falls into the meaninglessness of the totality due to boredom. That person who learns to live in fear discovers his inability to be-in and in the face of this, fear operates parallel to his existence. “Whoever has overcome the fear of dying has also triumphed over life, which is nothing more than the other name of that fear.” (1937, p.6) This victory is only possible in the face of boredom with life, it is similar to the perspective of the patient who is more afraid of the idea of continuing to be than of ceasing to be. Only illness is capable of offering the lucidity necessary to break the illusion that life plays in matter.

**The weariness and the emptiness in God:**

“In full boredom, we slide towards the lowest point of the soul and of space, towards the antipodes of ecstasy, towards the roots of the Void.” (p.124, 1952) The weariness of life leads to the obsession with death, which implies the constant ideation of one's own, it is important to point out that, for illness, pain and death, there is no weariness, these experiences by the emptiness they offer is inexhaustible, there is no limit to the patient's deterioration, their decline does not imply conflict, it is a fluid progress that culminates and continues in the death of the body. This is the problem of the meaninglessness of health and action, all effort is reduced to nothing, no matter how hard some struggle to cling to life, all die. Such an effort is nothing more than a waste, life as a good is an illusion, life is a perishable good, the human being is a being who has no other destiny than non-being. This allows us to conclude that the life of the being is a deception product of knowledge as self-awareness, the fear of death in this sense part of its enigmatic and inexhaustible character. A consciousness that thinks itself perceives its loneliness and isolation, but fails to consider itself identical, its destiny in terms of ceasing to be is inconceivable from its being. The illusion of identity is constantly threatened by its rupture and fear is nothing more than a constant.

Life as fear leads to unresolvable conflict which inevitably ends in ecstatic exhaustion leading ultimately to God. The martyr does not implore for the end of his pain, but uses his pain as a means to death. He seeks God not as a subterfuge for his salvation, the protection of his life, but to lead him to death. Eternity directly evokes the image of death itself, it links God's emptiness with ours. Our emptiness is the reality of our condition of non-being and the emptiness of God is the immensity in which we are nothing. In my experience I can add that those people who fear death tend to fear life and those who self-destruct fear themselves.

The experience of inner emptiness is only possible under the torments that precede ecstasy. It is the limited experience that refers to the image of torment and exhaustion in which we can contemplate our own emptiness (the meaninglessness of all action) and in turn, the emptiness in God (The immensity in which everything loses its being), ""the union between human solitude and the infinite desert of God becomes inexpressible delight"" (1937, p.16), sublime suffering that awakens man from his illusion of being and leads him little by little to non-man, the absolutely abject, the person who directs his tantalizing impulses against himself.

For Cioran, interest in God stems from this process of fear, boredom and obsession that culminates in the ecstasy of tears that is symptomatology of the soul, since only in the limits of the body as matter can the soul lose consciousness of the illusion in which exists. “We find God in sin, god on the way to the heights of despair: The more we care about God, the more we lose our innocence. In paradise, no one cared about him. It was the fall, and only the fall, that caused this strange curiosity.” (1937, p.18)

Time begins in the fall, Cioran understands humanity as exiled from paradise, eternally yearning and condemned to exist in a vacuum, alienated and alone. “Between Weariness and Ecstasy, our entire experience of time unfolds” (p.44, 1952) where becoming is agony, an outcome that finds its home within obsession where tedium itself becomes the substance of emptiness, Exhaustion stems from incapacity and the gradual loss of the meaning of all action. Existence leads to the void, to the fall, to the corpse, to the abject. Only in the alienation of the abjection of being that is in itself: non-being, is the end of temporal experience as possible, suffering becomes immeasurable and puts an end to the anguish that sustains our being in the world. Suffering belies this stay and leads to the end, to pause, to the idea of death. In this way, the temporary experience is a solitary encounter that continually throws us into “a nothing that grows, a void in full expansion, similar to a threat from beyond. In the silence of contemplation (...) the advance of time within itself as the advance of death” (p.148, 1934). The non-being, lies in wait for everything that is, it is not hasty to suppose in the face of the experience of the void that only the non-being can be sustained as constant, the void as the only reality.

**Thought against itself as a response to the boredom of the world:**

Cioran's proposal to resignify the world is thought against itself, only surrendering ourselves to emptiness and nonsense allows us to put an end to the illusion. To think against oneself is to scheme in favor of emptiness, to eliminate the self and all consciousness of identity with the matter. This delivery allows complete detachment, submerges us in the void and denies life, denies the self of its existence, the man of his progress and the history of his victories. Thus he builds the myth of failure, returns all progress to nothing, completely eliminates reason. It is a surrender to irrationality, rejects salvation and takes the path that leads to despair.

Salvation is finally empty, every social construct or memory is part of a decay designed by those who named things, all part of the substantiation of the world, the origin of knowledge that culminates in the fall, exile and loneliness, nonsense of language and yearns for primitive ignorance. Science is proof of our absolute incapacity as animals, due to our weakness we resort to external tools, our body alone, unlike other animals, is not capable of surviving without technology. History is the root of our forgetting, annihilates, like the emptiness of time, all action, all memory, feeds illusions, and builds false victories. The tedium generated by the apogee of progress, and the boredom of great civilizations naturally leads to decadence, to curiosity about pain, to internal impulses that respond to the reality of our non-being, self-destruction is the conclusion that comes from thought against itself. Self-hatred appears as a response to the rupture with the illusion of identity, self-destruction allows movement, and the change that leads being to stop being, constantly allows us to be another.

""You don't abdicate overnight: you need a carefully nurtured atmosphere of retreat, a legend of defeat."" (p.13, 1956) Like Rome, all civilization is driven through its greatness to boredom and the decline that they themselves cause in the face of boredom. The legend of defeat is built through internal conflict and division, born of mistrust, of expatriate parties that do not respond to identity, it is a war that is fought without fear in order to be another, non-being. Through the lucidity that comes from insomnia, in the ecstasy of the martyr, in the absolute experience of pain, “ a destructive energy is born (...) acid exaltation, the euphoria of annihilation! Surrendering to him, they hope, without a doubt, to be cured of that disease that is conscience. ” (p.16, 1956) The consciousness that comes from this experience bypasses the individual in such a way that only the idea of non-being is sustained. Facing the void we remain abject.

Thought against itself is a direct attack against time and life, it calls for complete immobility, the secession of all action, all thought. Here the individual “ is already tired of being himself, of walking in the uncertain, of wandering through the truths. Put the chains of Illusion on me, he sighs, as he bids farewell to the pilgrimages of Knowledge. ” (p.12, 1956) Thought against itself starts from the need for a change, from a force that leads to death or rebirth, if identity is experienced, it is a human impulse to abject it and return it to its diversity. It is this abjection that denies all identity that allows one to experience such a profound hatred for oneself that it inescapably leads to the only sustainable truth: non-being.

In this journey, man is transfigured, rejects the absolute, lose fear of time, and reconfigures himself as a non-man. “ Consciousness, temporary phenomenon if any, is pushed by it to its breaking point and falls to pieces with it. When destroyed, it will rise to its essence and fulfill its mission: to become its own enemy. If life has falsified matter, he has falsified life. ” (p.75, 1956) The non-man lives in a limited experience of existence, in which pain and fear end up sinking him out of time, below life and death. “ The maximum detachment that we can claim is to maintain ourselves in a position equidistant between revenge and forgiveness, in the midst of sullenness and generosity that are equally soft and empty, destined to neutralize each other. ” (p.33, 1960) All meaning is reduced to a complete banality in which fear does not seem to dominate the individual. It is in the emptiness of meaning where freedom manifests itself, in turn, what is the use of being free without meaning?

**Of internet suicides:**

Cioran introduces us to a philosophy born of depression, obsession, and insomnia. Here the term philosophy seems not very successful, perhaps more than a philosophy Cioran presents us with the roots of philophobia. But if we understand philosophy as the thought of an individual, we will find that Cioran offers not only a pessimistic and unstructured cynicism but a theory that seeks to encompass the experience of ecstasy under the framework of pain and despair. Cioran's pessimism is not an ethical guide, nor a metaphysics of reality, but a detailed phenomenology of his own experiences, which becomes an interpretive system of what I consider to be the experience of abjection, the encounter with non-being. and the outcomes it causes. To deepen this experience, it is necessary to delve into those manifestations that confirm the self-destructive impulses coming from civilization in decline.

It's hard to explain how spaces like Tumblr started a phenomenon that in my experience can only be defined as a suicide cult. On the internet, both blogs and forums, groups dedicated to specific topics emerged easily. I mention Tumblr for being a space where there was no type of filter in the content and at the same time an aesthetic approach focused on photos, poems and short texts. On Tumblr blogs, nurses shared their obsession with death. Here the narratives of pain overflowed, the images constantly referred to the fragility of the body, to blood, vomiting, fear, and violence. In that space, I discovered that loneliness and inner emptiness refer to a total emptiness that is shared. It is surprising to discover thousands of isolated, abject. Immersed in linguistic and symbolic themes, which are usually only assigned to silence or to the consulting room. If life is anguish and illness, the illusion that life manifests over matter is security, health, and progress. Few are the spaces in which it is allowed to live in disease, few are the spaces in which we can share the phenomenological experience of the pathology that living implies.

For this reason, I resort to forums on depression, illness, and suicide, these spaces are a clear source of obsession with salvation/sin/death, pain, boredom, experiences of emptiness and endless narratives that lead to abjection through thought against himself. These narratives are also developed under the same conditions of isolation and solitude that allow the complete dissolution of the illusion that life exerts on matter. I believe Cioran has the necessary conceptual keys to be able to understand the symptoms of a collective illness that seems to come from a non-sense that puts into play any idea of progress and any conception of health. What can be health or happiness for the abject that exist annihilating themselves, those people who cannot return to the illusion and for this reason live in longing for the original ignorance. I consider that the conditions in which we exist encourage a greater study of thought against itself as soon as its presence advances like the void to which everything refers here inside the kenoma , the phenomenal world that is agony and disease ( *agnoia* and *pathos* ).

Finally, it is important to point out the dangers that Cioran and suicide forums bring, not all people are in a position to assimilate nonsense and embrace pain. I do not think that self-destructive behaviors can be promoted by acceptance and understanding, these mechanisms only validate them as a reality but do not incite them, what incites abjection is mistreatment, agony, suffering, illness, and loneliness. Only those who have the predisposition of a patient accustomed to his illness are capable of returning from the heights of despair to care for all those who have just returned. These spaces are born from the need to share that those initiated in the gnosis of suffering have, people who no longer yearn for the lost paradise, people who live to share their desert. The non-man is one who has passed through countless dizzying nights, countless punishments of his own design, one who has pursued in anguish every illusion to constantly meet the void. If this non-man can do something, it is to live his non-being and to maintain this abject existence, I consider the possibility of this existence to be in freedom, understanding, and communion necessary. Nobody could predict that at some point in history people would come together to enjoy the idea of their own death.

**Comments:**

To carry out this proposal, it is necessary to delimit a specific subforum and resort to the works referring to the abjection of being by Julia Kristeva , since a hermeneutic approach to the productions of these people would allow a deeper understanding of the idea of suicide today. . The question that guides this research is: In what way is the idea of suicide present in the lives of people who produce and consume dedicated to this idea? Also developing this interpretation within Gnostic metaphysics (Valentinian, specifically its Eastern interpretation) allows a greater understanding of the deception that life exerts on the matter.

Regarding Reddit, this forum was one of the spaces where Tumblr users (100 million monthly) migrated after the reforms and the ban on NSFW content (2018).

Regarding counterarguments, there are endless studies that strongly conclude that these spaces promote self-destructive behavior and have a negative effect on society. I will take as the main source the PHD Janis Whitlock specialist in self-harm and the relationship that social networks have with this phenomenon."
