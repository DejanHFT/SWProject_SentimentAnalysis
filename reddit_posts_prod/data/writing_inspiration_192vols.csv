Question about original content when “inspired by”,Plenty-Charge3294,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/192vols/question_about_original_content_when_inspired_by/,5,3,"I have a WIP that I keep getting into my head about and struggling to keep working on because I am so in my own way.

I have this idea that is based on/inspired by a DND campaign. The plot of my WIP is original. Both that happens in it is related to the campaign, but the party is heavily influenced by the party in the campaign. 

It’s not an unusual adventure group composition as far as the classes go, and I am making changes to species and abilities. In my world building, it’s lower-magic, so it’s not a straight across translation. The bard from my group is a bard in my story, but she doesn’t have spells. She’s trained in swordplay and is more of a fencer in combat. (It’s hard to explain without flooding you all with details!) Some of the personalities are the same. They were also pretty “industry standard” though - think a Druid who doesn’t like cities and is big on pranks.

My question is, where is the line as far as original content? It feels like I am putting my own twist on things, fleshing out things, completely overhauling other things, but the underlying interpersonal relationships and tensions are present. I think if my fellow players they would clock my inspiration. Is that bad? How close is too close? Should I just scrap it and get working on another idea? I really like one character, who is based on the character I played, so I want to keep working with him. Should I just work on a solo story with him instead of this ensemble piece?"
