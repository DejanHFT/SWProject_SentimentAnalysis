How do you keep motivation when working long hours?,whoppwhopp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4a4uff/how_do_you_keep_motivation_when_working_long_hours/,31,32,"I'm having a hard time keeping motivated to go to the gym. I love working out, but find myself with a lack of motivation after working long shifts. For example I just worked a string ranging from 10-19 hours a day. I just have the hardest time willing myself to go when I have to be up in 5 hours for the Next day of work. Just wanted to see if anyone can relate with this and how they push through it"
