Recommend something for me to watch this weekend.,Markkk01,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18d7llq/recommend_something_for_me_to_watch_this_weekend/,18,4,"Hello all,

I am looking for a movie recommendation for the weekend. I will have the house to myself and would like to watch something I have never seen before. Please recommend a movie you love. While I am open to any genre, I have had a stressful week and would prefer something funny and/or light hearted. I will watch whatever the top comment is at the time I am ready to start the movie, assuming I have not already seen it. I have access to basically all the major streaming services, but do not want to pay extra for the movie. Please hit me with your best recommendations! Once I’ve watched, I’ll report back on my thoughts (if you all would like to hear them). Thanks!

Edit: I ended up going with Palm Springs as I hadn’t seen it. It was a great experience! It was funny and light hearted enough and I really enjoyed the spin on the groundhogs day premise. The only critique I have is that it wrapped up somewhat abruptly. Overall though, I would say 8/10 thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you all for the recommendations! "
