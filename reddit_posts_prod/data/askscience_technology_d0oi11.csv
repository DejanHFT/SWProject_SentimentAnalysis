How advanced of a mechanical computer could be built with the technology available in the Middle Ages?,LordErec,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/d0oi11/how_advanced_of_a_mechanical_computer_could_be/,12,32,"I've enjoyed watching Minecraft redstone computer videos over the years and was just thinking what could actually be done IRL with a giant mechanical computer. I'm thinking of a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court type of situation, where a modern computer engineer suddenly is stuck in the middle ages with their level of manufacturing, but has the resources of a medieval kingdom and modern knowledge of computer architecture, theory and algorithms to use towards building the ultimate mechanical computing device.

Beyond just raw computing power, what sort of peripherals could be constructed? Storage arrays, displays, printers, etc?"
