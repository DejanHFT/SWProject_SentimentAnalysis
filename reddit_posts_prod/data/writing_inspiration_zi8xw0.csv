Where should inspiration be drawn from for new writers?,Lordfangz,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/zi8xw0/where_should_inspiration_be_drawn_from_for_new/,20,2,"Hello all,
I’m currently getting back into reading in order learn more about how I can improve my writing craft, while also gaining further inspiration for my concept. But I had to stop and think, does all inspiration have to come from other literary works, or literature at all?
I’ve been a huge fan of graphic novels as equally as written novels, and I personally find myself inspired by the worldbuilding some of them do in comparison to some written literature.
So I’ve got to ask, both personally and generally, is it alright to draw inspiration from a graphic novel to write a literary novel?
Are other sources such as television and film good sources as well?"
