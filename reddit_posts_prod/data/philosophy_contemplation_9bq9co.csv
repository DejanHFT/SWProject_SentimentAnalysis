Particle Identity Crisis,10yearRelapse,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/9bq9co/particle_identity_crisis/,14,6,"It's a late night (5 am) here in Europe, and I found myself contemplating the fact that individual quantum particles can not be distinguished from each other, their properties are 100% identical. In fact, they are not only identical, they are *fungible*. Something being fungible means that all properties are exactly the same, seemingly concluding that it means that you can't attach any identity to it. David Deutsch (inventor of quantum computing and leading Many Worlds Interpretation supporter) use money as an example of fungibility; if you have 2 dollars in your bank account, there is no fact of the matter which is which when you withdraw one of them, they are not only identical, but fungible. Now, in the aforementioned example one can easily see that this sort of concept is a human model, the fungibility here is rooted in our collective psychology . The fungible property is really made up of neural networks in our brain in correlation with the 1s and 0s that come into being from the logic gates in the computers that make up our bank account. Fine, what does this have to do with particles and their identity? In his book '*The Beginning of infinity*' David Deutsch brings this out of the realm of human construct and apply it to the physical world in his arguments for the multiverse (which is a topic too rich to discuss at the same time as my late night musings). The example is as follows:

​

>If you pedal your bicycle until you have built up a kinetic energy of ten kilojoules, and then brake until half that energy has been dissipated as heat, there is no meaning to whether the energy dissipated was the first five kilojoules that you had added or the second, or any combination.

​

In an attempt to be neutral, I would obviously never dispute the natural conclusion of Deutsch's paragraph, it's true that it has no physical bearing when or where those kilojoules were built up, they are for all practical purposes the same. A Devil's Advocate would point out that while the energy's properties are indeed the same, energy is quantized, thus there is a fact of the matter which energy dissipates and which energy remains. I will grant this argument, but once you contemplate the fact that all particles that make up the energy are in fact the same, you are back to the problem of a particle's identity. Essentially to accept the Devil's Advocate's argument you have also accepted the axiom of identity. What makes them separate if there is no difference between them in a physical sense?

​

As I found myself pondering this in the back of my mind while cooking, a faint memory resurfaced from my neural network: John Wheeler once ""joked"" to Feynman over the phone that the whole universe is just one electron zigzagging back and forth in time. Let's just say that the conclusion is that for this to be true there'd have to be a symmetric number of positrons and electrons in the universe, which all known physics observations refute. Wheeler was of course no dummy, so he was well aware of this and used this thought provoking argument to prove other concepts related to space-time.

​

At first glance these musings are a priori rejected as ridiculous and too bizarre to take seriously by our primate brains, which did not evolve to contemplate the intricacies of the foundation of existence. However, our brain's inherent limitations aside, if there is really no objective truth to one particle having *any* sort of identity, it does beg the question if there is **any** fundamental argument to be made for distinguishing the *identity* of two fungible particles outside of our qualia.
