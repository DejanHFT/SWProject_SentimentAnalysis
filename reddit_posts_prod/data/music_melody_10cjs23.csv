The parts in the middle of songs where all the melody stops except vocals,Viy-kiaro,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/10cjs23/the_parts_in_the_middle_of_songs_where_all_the/,12,9,"Is there a specific technical name for the moments in certain songs where all the melody stops except from maybe the drums or clapping and the vocals?

I believe (twisted Sister ~ we're not gonna take it) has one and (the struts ~ could have been me) has one too

Genuinely curious if there's an actual term for it because it's one of my fave parts of the songs

Thank you ☺️"
