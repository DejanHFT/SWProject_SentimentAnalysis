I realised today my Great Grandfather is quite historically interesting.,Robbieworld,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2gr0l8/i_realised_today_my_great_grandfather_is_quite/,93,827,"My Great Grandfather, Otto Baumbach, was a German glassblower living in Manchester. [He produced the glassware used by Captain R Scott on his  Antarctic Expedition in 1910](http://imgur.com/ij8BMGu) and he also produced the scientific glassware used by [Ernest Rutherford to conduct his ground-breaking works in physics, which famously credited him with ""splitting the atom""](http://www.physicshistory.org.uk/NewsLTR/n23/n23p44.htm). Initially Otto was [not interned as an illegal alien during war time due to Rutherford's intervention](http://books.google.com.au/books?id=yvtjtKSfX54C&pg=PA240&lpg=PA240&dq=Baumbach+rutherford+split+atom&source=bl&ots=4exuDxAd15&sig=VrU01rLJykWTU_WEV6PUuz4br9E&hl=en&sa=X&ei=kLMaVP3BJ9fluQTz2IHQCw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Baumbach%20rutherford%20split%20atom&f=false), however his intemperate patriotic outbursts eventually cost him his freedom. After this he was interned as an illegal alien in England. In the camp he became friends with Joseph Pilates who was, at the time, very interested in [simple minimal-equipment exercise regimes to stay healthy in the camp confines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Pilates).
