My protein problem: allergic to nuts and beans. How to snack well?,type_a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3353rt/my_protein_problem_allergic_to_nuts_and_beans_how/,96,119,"The long and short of it is that I have an incredibly hard time meeting my macros with protein, and I'm starting to get frustrated to the point of almost not caring.

I'm allergic to nuts and most beans which puts a lot of restrictions to what i can do to be healthy. I'm lucky in the fact that beans only trigger OAS, and not a full blown anaphylaxis, but trying to eat meals that make my mouth itch and burn for an hour every meal just isn't sustainable. 

So here's my question: how can i get more protein in my diet for my small, non cooking meals and snacks? 

Right now I've gotten by with my shakes, chicken for dinner, and whatever i can find for lunch in the city with protein, but I know I can do better. What other simple foods can I try to get my numbers up?

EDIT: That's a lot more suggestions than I thought I'd get,  thanks everyone. I may need to start doing a second breakfast now.

EDIT 2: OH GOD THE RECIPIES"
