Early Morning Workouts? Getting Up and Getting Motivated,check_my_gracillis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2dvl8j/early_morning_workouts_getting_up_and_getting/,771,1196,"Anyone else a believer in the early morning workout? I'm trying to get into the habit of early rising and it has been super tough being consistent about waking up at 4am to get over to the gym.

What do you guys and gals do to wake up, get motivated, and start your day before the sun does?

Super Late Edit: I'm really glad this thread blew up and I'm glad I got a bunch of great advice and few fellow future morning lifters. Thanks people, you really made my week!"
