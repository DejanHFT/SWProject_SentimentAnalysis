Edit1: I found a video on the card of them speaking. They have British accents or possibly Australian. I'm Not good with accents.

Edit2: Here are a few pics that may help to pinpoint where they have been. Thats definatly Brazils flag. http://imgur.com/a/KTRfH

Edit3: Thanks for all the support Reddit!! Unfortunatly no luck yet, though I see some awesome ideas that i will follow through with. Pics were already submited to http://www.ifoundyourcamera.net/  last night. Also i saw a request for the video to help with the accent. This will be posted when I return from work. Thanks for all your help!!"
