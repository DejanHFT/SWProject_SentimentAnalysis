"19 hour layover in Paris, should I leave and explore?",SadResolution8577,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/120a1b6/19_hour_layover_in_paris_should_i_leave_and/,54,20,"I land at 8pm and my international flight the next day is at 3:40pm (guessing I’d need to be there around 1pm). Is this enough time to get into the city and sight see a bit that night & early morning? I will need to sleep for a few hours in a hotel. 

I’ll be flying out of CDG & it doesn’t look like I need a visa as I’m a U.S. resident."
