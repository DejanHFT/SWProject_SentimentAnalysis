"Macbeth is a literary masterpiece that, in my opinion, kickstarted psychological genres of literature",RodionRomanovich1866,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/13yecz7/macbeth_is_a_literary_masterpiece_that_in_my/,37,85,"Macbeth is the shortest, bloodiest and by far most exciting play Shakespeare has to offer, and I feel like despite its presence in the school system (England) people don’t really realise it’s ingenuity.

Seriously, it’s arguably one of the first stories ever written to truly focus on the psyche, the *why* of characters. Macbeth isn’t some evil, 2D character, he really struggles with the thought of regicide, a strong theme in relation to the great chain of being, convincing himself that he doesn’t need to kill to claim the throne initially but eventually, with Lady Macbeth’s persuasion, he executes the unforgivable sin of murdering a King (Maybe a few decades too early) and it’s here, the aftermath of such an obscene act, that the play truly flourishes, as Macbeth descends deeper into his tyrannical madness, a consequence of his reliance on the unnatural witches, who themselves even begin to see Macbeth as wicked.

And all it comes to a crashing end with his overconfidence ultimately being his demise, as his kingdom built on blood falls apart under its own wickedness; “All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this here spot,” Lady Macbeth says in her final soliloquy, and in my favourite quote of all, remarks that “What’s done can not be undone;” a terrible realisation echoing from an earlier sentiment in the play- “What’s done is done.” It comes full circle, the true scale and horror of her actions have set in, which are all too much for her as she eventually takes her own life.

And to end with, since this is way longer than I expected, my favourite soliloquy- “Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.”  I interpret this as the effect of godlessness on Macbeth, stemming from killing God’s appointed regent on Earth, as early as from when he was unable to say amen. He is resigned in this speech, somber and almost nihilist; psychologically, what with Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane, and Banquo’s long line of kings shown earlier, perhaps he has acknowledged his fallibility, even if none of woman born can harm Macbeth, what toll has it taken on his person? What kingdom is there left to rule?

This play is really quite spectacular, a classic tragedy, the fall from grace of a once noble servant to a tyrannical, immoral usurper. Really, read this play. It’ll take hardly half an hour but it’ll be worth all the more.

(BTW, I tried to post this on literature but it didn’t work? Anyone know what’s up with that?)"
