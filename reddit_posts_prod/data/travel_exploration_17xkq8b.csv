Exploring on Layover,bmoil809805,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17xkq8b/exploring_on_layover/,11,0,"I’m planning a vacation to Barcelona for our family next year. We’re American. I don’t have much international flying experience mostly Mexico, Canada.  If we had a 9 hour layover in Stockholm, is it possible to explore the city for the day? Or would customs or just time prevent it? Would our checked luggage have to go with us? 

How about on our return trip. An overnight layover in London. Would we be able to get a hotel room near the airport?

I’m sure there are all kinds of hurdles I’m not thinking about. Haven’t booked the flights yet. Stockholm in particular appeals to me because I have Swedish ancestry. 

TIA!"
