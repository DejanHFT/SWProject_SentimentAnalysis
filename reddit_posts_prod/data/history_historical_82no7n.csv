What is in your opinion the most accurate historical fiml/movie that is also fun to watch.,EBlackadder4,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/82no7n/what_is_in_your_opinion_the_most_accurate/,164,90,"For me it's the 1970 film Waterloo. After watching this video, i did my own research and was amazed. I wish that they still made movies like this.

But now i'am looking for other historical films that are accurate and fun. Not an inspired story or a hollywood addaptation that alters things to make things more entertaining than accurate.

EDIT: I did not expect this big of a response. I've written down about 50+ suggestions

So thank you for your suggestions.
