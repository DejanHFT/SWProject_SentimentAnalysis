FPS games that rely on strategy more than gunplay,Davdarobis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/u8ggl2/fps_games_that_rely_on_strategy_more_than_gunplay/,21,7,I love overwatch because quickly lining up your cross hairs with the enemy isnâ€™t the most important skill in the game. Strategy is far more important. Any other first person shooters like this out there?
