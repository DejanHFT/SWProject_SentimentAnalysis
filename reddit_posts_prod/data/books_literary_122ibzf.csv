Best literary dads?,yoknapatawpha425,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/122ibzf/best_literary_dads/,907,1591,"In teaching high school English (American Lit), I have noticed in all the books in the curriculum, characters who are fathers are either morally gray at best (John Proctor in The Crucible, Billy Pilgrim in Slaughter House 5, Jacob Vaark in A Mercy) or outright scumbags (Tom Buchanan in Gatsby, Walt McCandless in Into the Wild).

This got me thinking: who are your favorite literary dads? Hans Huberman from The Book Thief is one who is just so genuinely good-hearted, he has actually inspired me as a father (as much as a fictional character can): endlessly patient, unconditionally loving, and always willing to do the right thing."
