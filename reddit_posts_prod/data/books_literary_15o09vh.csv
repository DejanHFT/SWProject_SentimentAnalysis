Jason Pargin does not get his due in literary circles,CallynDS,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15o09vh/jason_pargin_does_not_get_his_due_in_literary/,37,104,"Jason Pargin/David Wong of John Dies at the End fame does not get his due in discussions of modern authors. I've read three of his JDatE novels, the cyberpunk powerhouse that is Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits and am working on the second of the Zoey Ashe novels and just like dude. Between the depression-confronting ""the horror is our society"" of JDatE and the balls of publishing a cyberpunk book in 2015, 23 years after Snow Crash killed the genre and being able to write a good one, people should be talking about Jason Pargin more. He's a commendable author doing impressive things and I've yet to be disappointed with one of his novels. Why is he not up for awards and shit?"
