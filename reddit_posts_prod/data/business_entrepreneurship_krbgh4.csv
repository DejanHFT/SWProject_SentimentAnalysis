"Student Debt Is Crippling EntrepreneurshipWith Covid-19 battering the economy, helping aspiring business owners seems like a no-brainer.",BikkaZz,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/krbgh4/student_debt_is_crippling_entrepreneurshipwith/,0,0,"For aspiring entrepreneurs, student debt reduces the amount of cash availÂ­able for startups and affects their credit score, making business loans tough to secure. It also renders more daunting the prospect of failure, which increases risk aversion. The impact of debt may show up as well in the share of new entrepreneurs between the ages of 20 and 34, which fell to 27 percent in 2019, from 34 percent in 1996, according to a recent Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation study.

The problem isn't just that young people are postponing their big dreams. Sixty percent of student borrowers expect debt to linger into their 40s, Citizens Bank found in 2016.

Debt-ridden founders may also be less selective about whom they take on as capital partners, prioritizing ready cash over the best alignment with the business. And they're less likely to launch risky growth companies. To keep up with their payments, they need money fast, and so can't take the time required to experiment and innovate."
