Astronomy with Homeless people? üåôüî≠,Infinity-Seeker96,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/w6yzkv/astronomy_with_homeless_people/,66,356,"I live close to a huge parking space in London, Ontario, Canada and for some reason I woke up at 4 AM yesterday (Saturday - July 23). I looked out through the window and it was a clear sky. So I decided to go out and do some lunar + planetary observation and imaging. Yep, I'm a Recreational Astronomer who does stuff like this for fun and to contemplate on my own life. I parked my car in a random spot and did my thing for about an hour.
  
Just when I was about to pack my stuff and leave, three homeless people approached me. They weren't drunk or high so I wasn't worried. They asked if they can look through my Telescope and I pointed my scope towards the moon üåô It was a beautiful crescent and my scope (dobs 8"") is powerful enough to reveal craters and much more specific details. So they were surprised to look at the moon that close and started discussing with me about Astronomy. One of them even knew about the James Webb Space Telescope.!! After about 5 mins, they asked me my name (Mohammed), thanked me immensely and left me after sharing their view that a lot of people don't even talk to folks like them and I was kind enough to show them the Moon. My mentor the previous day told us that old people just feel lonely sometimes and spending some quality time with them would be the best thing to do at times. He was talking about senior housing crisis but these people are no different than that too. I was glad that I could do the best I can by putting some smile in their faces that morning. I'll always continue to include everyone in my journey of sharing my passion and I was lucky I had 3 guests that day.
  
Thanks for reading, have a nice and cozy Sunday üå•Ô∏è
