What feats of strength can you achieve?,ClanOfCoolKids,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4431gp/what_feats_of_strength_can_you_achieve/,130,44,"My deadlift (325 x 6) puts me in advanced for my weight and age group (168, 16).

I feel this is more or less strong, at least for as long as I've been lifting (7 months).

To humble myself, I've come here, to way stronger people, to ask a simple question: what cool/incredible feats of strength can you achieve?"
