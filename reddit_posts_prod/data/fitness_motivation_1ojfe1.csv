Since my childhood days, I have always been called ""The big one"". I tried being health conscious all my life, e.g. never eating chocolates, candy or drinking soda, not going for fast food and being vegetarian. But not doing much physical exercise (I didn't play outside as a kid, stressing too much on academics), I grew up into this big chunk of mass. I tried going on hour long walks daily for a few months, but that's didn't do much benefit other than maintain the weight. Plus my immunity was too shabby, catching cold every month, since I wasn't much off an outside person. I was the guy who hadn't run more than 30 seconds till age 25.

And then one fine day, reading up some material on /r/fitness and daily doses of motivation from transformation photos. I decided to do something to change this....""do something everyday, and eat the right things"".

**Diet**: Went on a vegetarian Paleo diet, i.e. eating raw/unprocessed things. In the past 12 months, I have eaten less than a dozen cooked dinners, mostly eating fruits. For protein, eggs, milk and protein supplements.

**Exercising**: I started slow biking, biking 2 hours every day. Mixing in some hiking, and Canoe Racing. Started learning swimming and eventually running. Eventually started with strength training. Now I often do 100 mile rides in the weekend.

**Avg daily calorie deficit for 16 months** : 600 calories

**Trick to keep motivated** : Sign up for some event, say a 5K running, bike event or a triathlon. Once you pay, motivation and discipline comes automatically. Getting a coach helps since there's someone who reads your progress and recommends how not to get injured.


Some mention able events:

- Came rank 6th race walking at a major marathon. (5 hours 55 minutes)
- Have done two 200 mile cycling events, including a 24 hour cycling event
- Done upto 35 mile hiking events

The future:

- Trying to go over 300 miles in 24 hour endurance cycling races
- Finish an Ironman in 2014

To everyone who posts transformation photos, and who give advice to others, a big thank you for motivating people to achieve a healthier lifestyle."
