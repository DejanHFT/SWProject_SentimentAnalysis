What inspired you to create your favorite couple in your book and/or book series?,KolarWolfDogBear,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18feg3m/what_inspired_you_to_create_your_favorite_couple/,24,7,"My favorite couple is in my current WIP

What inspired me to create them was seeing shows with lesbian couples and how they're bond was so strong and how some stook together even when the world was against them. To me sapphic love is so sweet compared to other couples and but can have it's hardships that the couple fight through.

I also saw how most shows don't show two QPOC characters in a relationship and wanted to add more of those types of couples into the world.

What about you guys?"
