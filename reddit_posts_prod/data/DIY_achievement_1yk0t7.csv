How can I achieve a finish such as this on the new desk I'm building? Both are imaged,sirskitzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1yk0t7/how_can_i_achieve_a_finish_such_as_this_on_the/,6,5,"I'm not worried about the two-tone on the desktop. I will most likely make the top one solid color and two tone the cabinets/framing. The main wood is oak, from Lowes, and the framing is select pine. It's my first time staining so I'm just wanting to know what type of stains I should be looking for to achieve the finish in the image.
