"2014 Achievement: 1,130 lb Total",Naculp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2qvdrf/2014_achievement_1130_lb_total/,36,48,"Maxed out to see what I had accomplished in the gym this year. Pretty proud of the results, despite mixing long distance running and lifting. Ran two 1/2 marathons this year (mediocre runner here) and lifted 1,130 lbs in the Big 3.

Running-wise I didn't follow any specific program. I just tried to get my long runs in on Saturdays, getting up to ~12 or so miles a couple weeks out from my race. Through the weeks I normally would just do 6 miles or so (the distance around the block where I live). I managed to PR my 1st half by only ~20 seconds or so, but it's still a step in the right direction. The 2nd half was more of a leisurely run with friends.

For lifting I followed Mehdi's SL 5x5 for a few months. I've been lifting for about 13 years now, but I've struggled with consistency the past few years. When I tested maxes this past week, my 1RMs were as follows:

Squat: 425

Bench: 300

Dead: 405

**Total: 1130**

Bodyweight 220 lbs @ 5'11
