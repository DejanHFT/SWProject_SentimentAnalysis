My changes after 6 months

So i had a lot of people ask me about my routine and what i trained on certain days. So instead of tracking each person down I've attached both last months work out routine as well as my one day a week ab routine.
If abs are your main goal i would try to hit them 3 times a week. Below is a link with a basic but intense little ab routine that i hit weekly. I keep the rest on ab day between sets down to about 10-15 secs, just enough time to catch a good breath and go in again. When switching exercises i only rest for the amount of time it takes me to get into the next position.

For the weight training portion i switch up the rep/set count every month and mix up the order of the muscle group days. With weight training i keep my rest down to 20seconds and jump right back in. The last few of each set should be a struggle. The last few reps of the last 2 sets should almost be impossible for you to get up but you just have to push that little extra. If you can't get it set the weight down for a 5seconds and jump back in to finish the set. The link is below and you can google every move on the list to see how its performed properly.

Most important part of the weight training is proper form. Next let your ego tell you go heavy if you can't properly complete the motion. If you have to rock, swing, sway, hop, or anything else the weight is probably to heavy for you to hold good form. Im not saying to use baby weight but on every exercise the only part of your body that should move is the part holding the weight. if your doing bicep curls and your rocking back, or swinging your arms go down in the weight. Keep your core solid, and steady. It will help target the direct muscle.
