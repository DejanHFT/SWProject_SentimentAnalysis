Is Current Audio Amplification Technology at the Limits of Physics?,emorcen,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7trjjw/is_current_audio_amplification_technology_at_the/,5,15,"I'm a full-time busker and have been wondering about the physics behind audio amplification and speakers lately. I currently carry about 15kg (20 if you count the guitar) worth of battery-powered PA equipment around and even with that weight, the amplification reaches to about only 50 people in an open venue. 

I am wondering if speaker/amplification technology has hit a ceiling when it comes to efficiency and weight relative to dispersion and volume? Should we be looking forward to a future when we can use 5kg worth of amplifying equipment to reach a crowd of hundreds or is that just plain physically impossible? 

Thanks!"
