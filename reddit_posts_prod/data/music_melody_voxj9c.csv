melody vs Lyrics,Yannie2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/voxj9c/melody_vs_lyrics/,29,20,My friend and I are very different when it comes to how we listen to music. I could not care less about lyrics if the beat  and melody is good it goes into my playlist but for my friend they care deeply about lyrics not only must she resonate with the lyrics but she needs to know who the artist is what are they about does this artist care about the same things she does. So when I try and introduce her to new songs she always asks about the artist which I can never answer lol. Me I could love a song for years and still not know the Lyrics. I think Its because I grew up listening to house music which has little to no lyrics. Learning lyrics to a song is usually a conscious effort for me. Anyone else like me out thereðŸ˜…
