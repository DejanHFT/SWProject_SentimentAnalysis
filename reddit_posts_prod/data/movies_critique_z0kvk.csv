Most disturbing movie you've ever watched??,Higgins420,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/z0kvk/most_disturbing_movie_youve_ever_watched/,685,119,"Sorry if this has been posted a million times over, I've been lurking on reddit for the past year and only got an account 2 months ago.

Anyway...I just recently watched Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom, and I'd say that has to be the most disturbing film I've seen. I saw David Cross listed it as one of his top five favorite films so I was interested to see what it was all about. Very hard film to watch but also very well shot. The ""circle of shit"" part was particularly tough. Definitely not a movie I will forget anytime soon.

For people who don't know of it I recommend looking it up on YouTube, especially a 2-part film analysis which lasts about 50 minutes that explains how the movie is a critique on capitalism."
