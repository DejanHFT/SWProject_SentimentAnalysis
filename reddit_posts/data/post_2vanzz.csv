Have we ever seen an example of recursive programming?,omen2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2vanzz/have_we_ever_seen_an_example_of_recursive/,12,1,"Apologies for title, not sure how to word this... what I mean is, has there ever been an example of some code that can re-write itself and evolve randomly/naturally? 

I ask because I've been reading a lot about AI lately but would be interested to know if we've ever created any code that updates or improves itself over time. "
