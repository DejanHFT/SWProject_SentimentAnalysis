Is it inappropriate to offer my support to my best friend in her upcoming birth?,Electronic_Salt_1847,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18dgpzt/is_it_inappropriate_to_offer_my_support_to_my/,17,54,"**TL;DR;** : Is it appropriate to let my best friend know I would love the opportunity to be there and help during this birth? And if so, how should I ask/offer?

This is my first time posting to Reddit so I’m sorry if it’s not explained as smoothly as others. 

Background: I am 32 F. My BF (33 F) is pregnant with her 3rd child due in January. I do not have kids and do not want them (which she knows). For her first 2 sons, she had other friends there for their births and named them their god parents. I only mention this because her and her husband have named me in their wills as the caregiver of their kids should anything (god forbid) happen to them. I do not qualify as a god parent because… religion lol. I am autistic. This sometimes makes it hard for me to express my emotion or excitement for things and recognize what is appropriate to ask.

Onto the present: She is scaling back for this pregnancy, no baby shower or asking for gifts despite her youngest being 6 yo and not having much baby stuff. I’m not sure if she wants a friend present like her previous births or if she has already asked someone. I would love the opportunity to be there for her, but I’m not sure if I should let her know. This pregnancy has been so hard on her and I’m the first person she’s told for all 3. I’ve helped with all baby showers, birthdays, etc. arriving early to setup and staying late to help clean, and of course helping with the boys. She knows I love kids (especially hers), I just don’t want them myself. I want to make sure she knows I completely understand if she wants this birth private, but I also want to make sure she has someone to help/support like she had in previous births if she wants that.

So, is it appropriate to let my best friend know I would love the opportunity to be there and help during this birth? And if so, how should I ask/offer?

TIA"
