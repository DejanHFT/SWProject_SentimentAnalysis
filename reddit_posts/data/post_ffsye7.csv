"AskScience AMA Series: I'm Alan Aspuru-Guzik, a chemistry professor and computer scientist trying to disrupt chemistry using quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and robotics. AMA!",AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ffsye7/askscience_ama_series_im_alan_aspuruguzik_a/,100,106,"Hi Reddit! This is my first AMA so this will be exciting. 

I am the principal investigator of The Matter Lab at the University of Toronto, a faculty Member at the Vector Institute, and a CIFAR Fellow. I am also a co-founder of Kebotix and Zapata Computing. Kebotix aims to disrupt chemistry by building self-driving laboratories. Zapata develops algorithms and tools for quantum computing.

A short link to my profile at Vector Institute is [here](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/alan-aspuru-guzik/).
 Recent interviews can be seen [here](https://www.chemistryworld.com/opinion/alan-aspuru-guzik-science-is-at-a-crossroads/3010819.article), [here](https://www.utoronto.ca/news/u-t-s-al-n-aspuru-guzik-self-driving-laboratories-use-robotics-ai-automate-routine-parts), [here](https://www.utoronto.ca/news/mexican-american-chemist-why-he-left-harvard-u-t), and [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/beyond-quantum-supremacy-the-hunt-for-useful-quantum-computers/). MIT Technology Review recently recognized my laboratory, [Zapata](http://zapatacomputing.com/), and [Kebotix](http://www.kebotix.com/) as key players contributing to AI-discovered molecules and Quantum Supremacy. The publication named these technological advances as two of its 10 [Breakthrough Technologies](https://www.technologyreview.com/lists/technologies/2020/) of 2020. 

A couple of things that have been in my mind in the recent years that we can talk about are listed below:

+ What is the role of scientists in society at large? In this world at a crossroads, how can we balance efficiently the workloads and expectations to help society both advance fundamental research but also apply our discoveries and translate them to action as soon as possible?
+ What is our role as scientists in the emergent world of social echo chambers? How can we take our message across to bubbles that are resistant and even hostile to science facts.
+ What will the universities of the future look like?
+ How will science at large, and chemistry in particular, be impacted by AI, quantum computing and robotics?
+ Of course, feel free to ask any questions about any of our [publications](https://matter.toronto.edu/publications/). I will do my best to answer in the time window or refer you to group members that can expand on it.
+ Finally, surprise me with other things! AMA!

See you at 4 p.m. ET (20 UT)!"
