"Any delicious, highly recommended recipes involving beans?",tigerlily8291,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/km4ctz/any_delicious_highly_recommended_recipes/,73,68,"I’m trying to cut down on my meat intake a bit, therefore increasing other proteins into my diet. I love all kinds of beans but don’t really have any great recipes for them. I find garbanzo beans the easiest to cook with but also have cannellini, black, kidney, and other beans in my cupboard right now that I’d like to use. Thanks in advance!"
