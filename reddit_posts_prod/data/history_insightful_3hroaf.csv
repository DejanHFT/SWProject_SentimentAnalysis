"Before World War II and the rise of Hitler, what did people use as the common example of evil?",NegativeBee,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3hroaf/before_world_war_ii_and_the_rise_of_hitler_what/,523,1184,"Whenever I have a class discussion about morals or philosophy, someone will always bring up an iteration of, 'But what if you were Hitler?' They do this to think of the extreme example of wrongdoing. 

I was thinking about this question and what people might have used pre-WWII. Possibly Genghis Khan? Let me know what you think.

EDIT: Special thanks to u/amici_ursi for the awesome insight."
