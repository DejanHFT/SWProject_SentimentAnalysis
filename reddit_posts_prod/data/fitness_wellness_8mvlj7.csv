"My personal trainer, isn't well... I feel like I should expect more out of him",Ashkir,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8mvlj7/my_personal_trainer_isnt_well_i_feel_like_i/,39,64,"Hello! 

A few months ago I signed up for 48 Personal Training sessions over at In\-Shape. I really liked the idea of having someone that understands fitness to push me, help me learn how to use the equipment, and tell me what to do. It's just helpful. Especially, the fact, even though I'm hard of hearing I can watch them do whatever thing I need to do. Unlike a YouTube video, I can walk around my trainer and see their form.

When I try to do the form, the trainer is able to poke my back, help me move my arms, etc so I know what position is best. This has been the most helpful thing for me. Without this, I probably would've never left the treadmill at the gym. 

It works. When I joined this gym 3 months ago I weighted 178 lbs. I'm only 5'6"". I weighed myself today for the first time since then, the scale now says 162 lbs. 5lbs a month isn't bad. I had my pacemaker go off only once. But, the trainers all there, always tell me to constantly check my heartrate on my watch. But, I also went to the doctor, they programmed my pacemaker to go off at 145, they reset it to 180. 

I really, really, like the idea of training. But, I learned more from my personal trainer's manager than I have from my actual personal trainer. I learn more from him when I'm not even there for a personal training session. The personal trainer's manager had a spare 20 minutes and showed me how to use everything on the 29\-minute circuit. He wrote me a list of foods that are high in protein that I can eat, because I don't really eat meat. My personal trainer never did this. 

The gym's trainers have a ""folder"" where they keep it up to date with your measurements. Inside of the folder, there is supposed to be a paper from each session, that tells me what to work on. For 2 months straight I was never able to find my own folder. When I asked my trainer I was always told it was ""at home"" so he can work on it. I don't really like my personal identifiable information, about my fitness and health being at someone's home. And let alone I am never able to check it.

I have a CRT/Pacemaker implant. I can't really have pressure against my left shoulder on top of the pacemaker. The personal trainer can't seem to get this through is head, and keeps suggesting upper body exercise where I have to put pressure on the area. He keeps trying to have me do weights that make the CRT/PM area feel really stretched out. I told him I don't like it, but, he never has any alternatives. My arms going above my head isn't the best for me. I know I'm now recovered from my heart surgery in December, but, I don't feel comfortable with weights above my head. My cardiologist told me to try and avoid excercises where I put too much pressure on the CRT area, or above my head. 

Yesterday, I checked the file cabinet like we're supposed to do, curious if it was ever returned. It is there, but, only my first 2 sessions is in there. I've been going to the gym for 3 months. I had an emergency flight to Denver I had to go through my personal trainer's manager to reschedule my appointment. 

Any messages I leave for my trainer, I never get a call back. His freaken manager gave me his own \(the manager's\) cell number, where he text me new things he finds out about protein. The manager also texts me to see how I am a few times a week. 

Is it wrong of me to expect more out of my trainer? I really like that he makes me watch my heartrate, to ensure that I don't go over what my cardiologist wants. My folder is never updated. I feel like I'm paying just to have someone watch me at the gym now. I stopped learning new things. I don't think I want to renew for another 6 months, when my sessions are up in July. "
