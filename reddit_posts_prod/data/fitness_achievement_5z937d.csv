Healthiest way to achieve Caloric deficit,alterboy554,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5z937d/healthiest_way_to_achieve_caloric_deficit/,10,0,"Hello - Just completed a bulk and about to start cutting. My original plan was low carb/keto, 10-20% caloric deficit, 2 days lifting, and 2-3 days cardio...

A friend of mine suggested eating at a maintenance and using more cardio/lifting to achieve the caloric deficit. His reasoning was that by eating at maintenance, and eating often, my body would not go into ""starvation mode"" from a hormonal perspective and have more of a reason to retain the muscle mass I added. 

I thought that made sense, but cannot tell if its broscience or what.

Last year I cut a town via the original method I described. However, I had never bulked previously and for sure lost muscle (and even some hair because of how hard core i was..)

Looking for some feedback
