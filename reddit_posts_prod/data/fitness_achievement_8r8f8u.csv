How long should it take to achieve desired bf% around 10-12% starting at ~14%?,tomin8r1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8r8f8u/how_long_should_it_take_to_achieve_desired_bf/,17,14,"Hey r/fitness,

I just have a couple of questions regarding this topic. I'm currently sitting at ~14%bf having a -500 calorie deficit using CICO. 

I started my journey around 98kg and have dropped to around 75kg. So this has been an 'extended cut' for around a 10 month period. I'm now at the stage where I can possibly get shredded and reveal that infamous sixpack. I have put on some nice muscle on this journey and just want to see if it's possible to get some definition which I thought I never would in my life.

I have been monitoring my bf% with a combination of skin calipers and bf% scale. I know they are not 100% accurate but they have been consistent for progress.

I have noticed over the last couple of weeks that my %bf is slowing down (I guess to be expected..?)

My questions:

1. How should it take to achieve my goal from your experiences? I know bf% drop doesn't necessarily equate to weight loss drop.

2. How much actual weight should I still expect to lose? This is the lightest I've been and don't want to also jeopardize any muscle gain I've made too.

3. If my core is not as strong as I would like, is it worth training them more often? Can they still become defined on a calorie deficit? 

4. from my progress it seems my body likes to store fat around my thighs and abdomen. In this case should I even aim for a lower bf%?

Any additional recommendations would be helpful!
Cheers."
