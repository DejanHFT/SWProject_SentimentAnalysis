how well does overhead press carry over to bench and vice versa.,dazed111,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3aiitu/how_well_does_overhead_press_carry_over_to_bench/,70,83,"If you start out with two identical men. One trains the overhead press until he can do 100kg for 5 reps and the other trains the bench press until he can do 100kg for 5 reps. 

Then how much would guy A bench. 
And how much would guy B overhead press.

what i want to ask is which exercise has the best carryover effect and by how much"
