What are some great examples of the modern noir film genre?,Normal-Summer382,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/13opu9q/what_are_some_great_examples_of_the_modern_noir/,97,32,"Does anyone have some better examples of the noir genre, any style, in particular dark, American, sci-fi, etc.? 
I particularly like films such as L.A. Confidential, Chinatown, Dark City, and Pulp Fiction. Are there any films along these themes (particularly the American retro theme) that others have enjoyed?
I'm also happy to be critiqued on my examples, for instance, you don't think they should be in this category, or you don't think they are worthy of a mention."
