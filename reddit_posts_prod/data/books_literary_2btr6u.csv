Are literary 'classics' must-reads?,trillatoppa,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2btr6u/are_literary_classics_mustreads/,100,43,"Works such as Homers 'The Odyssey' and 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' have crossed my mind when choosing the next set of chapters in this summers reading list. But are they really worth reading? It seems to be that I choose newly released works over time-tested classics simply for their relevance and ease of readability. 

My question remains: should I make more of an effort to read literary staples? Are they necessary reads? Or should I accept that they have greatly influenced modern writing, and go out looking for the next classic? "
