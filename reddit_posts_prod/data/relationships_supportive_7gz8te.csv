How can I (20F) be supportive of my husband's (21M) social life when I have none?,Ihavenofriendshedoes,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7gz8te/how_can_i_20f_be_supportive_of_my_husbands_21m/,31,12,"I know we got married young, and this isn't a post about how to make friends. My therapist and I are working on that. 

However, especially now that my husband is working full time, and I'm in between jobs for 2 more months, it's become really hard to be glad for him when he goes out. I don't have any other socialisation some days apart from him and when he comes home at 11pm after happy hour drinks and goes on about how wonderful of a time he's had, it's hard to not feel really jealous and like I want to cry. Especially when he asks me what I've done that day and it's just been laundry and some cleaning. 


I want to be supportive for him and not make him feel like my social life revolves around him. It just feels really hard when he's telling me about how great his time is when I've literally just been waiting for someone to have a conversation with who isn't a cashier when I go grocery shopping. When he tells me things, I just want to cry but our house it too small to get away to do it in private as well, so I hold it all in. How do I be glad for him and not impose my jealousy to thwart his good time? 

TL;DR: I'm having a hard time being glad for my husband when he goes out and has a good time when I'm stuck at home and doing nothing. How do I put my feelings of jealousy and sadness aside to not make him feel bad? "
