How can I be a more supportive friend?,SecretAction7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/l589wl/how_can_i_be_a_more_supportive_friend/,0,2,"I need help working through my feelings

 One of my best friends goes to college across the the country. She hooked up with one of her friends ex-bfs who was with the guy for five years. She started talking to this guy a month ago and was asked to not have sex with him but did. My friend has a mutual friend with the guys ex girlfriend who is best friends with my friend and the girl who is the guys ex. 

Basically I feel like I could never hook up with a friends ex even if I’m not best friends with that friend. I feel like I can’t do things to hurt people like this. It’s my friends choice  that she did and I wasn’t annoyed about it at all. She told me today that her friend (who is mutual friends with her and the ex gf) was being really supportive bc she told her friend she wanted to kill herself. She told me she wants to mostly because she doesn’t think the guy will talk to her again but also a little because she feels bad about taking her friends guy. Honestly in highschool my friend would ditch groups and than as soon as she felt the slightest bit left out of a group she would run back to another group. Each time she’d apologize about how bad she felt for ditching me and friend. The truth is she did it repeatedly and if she felt bad she wouldn’t do it. She also had a choice in this situation. So it just bothers me bc she asks for sympathy and pretends like she feels so horrible when the truth is she doesn’t care about other people that much and if she did she would hurt them. She just wants to act like the victim and get pitty even though she’s hurting people.

I feel that I’m the type of person who can’t stop caring about others and couldn’t do these things that hurt them. I constantly feel so guilty and like a horrible person even if I’ve done nothing wrong. I know what it’s like to want to kill myself but I don’t use it to get pitty. I think talking through feelings with friends is great but I feel like she isn’t talking through feelings and just wants pitty. I keep most of my feelings inside and i truthfully think it bothers me seeing someone get all this sympathy and pitty even though I feel like that’s what I need. It’s my fault for not opening up to people but I also don’t want to be toxic, burden others, or ask for forgiveness by guilting someone. I think it bothers me bc I feel like she doesn’t care about others but gets all this sympathy while I care soooo much and get none. It’s my fault for not opening up but it hurts.

TL;DR I[19F] guess I can’t tell if this is a valid reason to be annoyed at her. I won’t show  I’m annoyed but I’m having a hard time being a supportive friend at the moment. It’s her own thing if she cares about other people and it’s her own thing if she begs others for validation/pitty. I feel like I’m bothered by this for selfish reasons. I feel like I’m being selfish because I don’t always think perfectly and in a selfless way.  and she is clearly upset if she mentioned suicide even though she does kind of romanticize mental illness and post romanticized stuff about it.

A part of me can’t help but wonder if what bothers me most is that she did this to one of her friends. Even though it’s her choice and doesn’t relate to me. I guess it just shows character and I don’t even think this makes her a bad person because everyone has different rights and wrongs but it still does"
