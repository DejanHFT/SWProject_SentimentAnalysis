Booktubers who read literary fiction,yellowbananagirl,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10bh1uk/booktubers_who_read_literary_fiction/,75,105,"I have been loving booktube recently but really struggling to find booktubers who read like me. I love all their little challenges and tags and things but when they talk about books it’s all things im not interested in at all.

I love jack in the books but he is one of the only peope who I have found. I don’t like fantasy or genre fiction, I am solely a literary fiction girlie with some non fiction and memoirs thrown in the mix (think 20 something cool girl). 

Any suggestions for booktubers who read like me?"
