advice on painting my own wheelchair,path-cat,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/14r1vhu/advice_on_painting_my_own_wheelchair/,4,2,"hiya! i suffer from orthostatic intolerance and my condition just got bad enough to need a wheelchair. the one with the right features at the right price only comes in one color-- any advice on how to go about repainting it? it's aluminum, and currently light blue. if possible i'd like to achieve an iridescent/opalescent black."
