Inspiration for writing...,Serious_Day_2585,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/vm5gkm/inspiration_for_writing/,19,4,"And no, I don't mean the usual what reason you have to right like your purpose or anything like that but rather what inspired you to write? Was it a particular series or book? Was it a tv show or movie or some other form of medium? I'm just curious on what first planted the idea of becoming an author or writer in your head. For me personally I was an avid reader growing up and I always enjoyed the goosebumps series when I was a kid. Maybe that's why I enjoy writing horror and crime thrillers as an adult. Again, just curious. Thanks in advance!"
