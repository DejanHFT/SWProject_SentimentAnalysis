What films do you regret missing at the cinema?,RummazKnowsBest,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16obalm/what_films_do_you_regret_missing_at_the_cinema/,857,414,"The Matrix - we were all hyped, my friend saw it and said it wasn’t anything special so I didn’t bother. Later we watched it on VHS and I was blown away, I was so angry with him haha 

Watchmen - ten years later another friend said he saw it and wasn’t that bothered about it. Didn’t really have anyone else to see it with. Finally got the DVD and loved it, immediately got the director’s cut. 

Edge of Tomorrow - same friend as above, can’t remember if he saw it and didn’t like it or just didn’t fancy it but I didn’t end up seeing it as a result. Loved it on blu-ray.  

Fury Road - couldn’t find a chance to go, or anyone to go with, had to wait for blu-ray. Should’ve just gone on my own which is a common theme here.

How about you?"
