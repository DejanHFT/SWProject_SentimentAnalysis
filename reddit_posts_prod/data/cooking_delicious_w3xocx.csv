how do i still cook delicious without onion or garlic?,Brokkenpiloot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/w3xocx/how_do_i_still_cook_delicious_without_onion_or/,43,15,"My girlfriend found out her body responds badly to wheat, onion and garlic. 

I loved making curriew, sukiyaki, etc. And i still really wanted to try a lot of dishes, like bone broth noodle soup.. however missing out on onion and garlic as ingredients makes me feel really handcuffed.

I should see it as a challenge, but it feels like such a mountain to climb.

Italian, texmex, asian in general.. the things i used to cook (albeit amateur level) all rely heavily on those 2 spices.

All I really have left feels like japanese curry, and usage of ginger and mushrooms.

Even ginger only sparingly thougg, as i do have the soapy flavour experience.

I'm at a loss. Is there anyone with solid tips?"
