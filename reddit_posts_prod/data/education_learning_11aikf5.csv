Interleaving learning technique,shizanuti_arm,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/11aikf5/interleaving_learning_technique/,1,0,"I read a lot about Interleaving technique and compares with the blocked one.

All articles show examples only with 1 field and separated topics. For example:

Field: Physics, technique: Learn different topics and revision them randomly

But I have a question now, what if I'm learning a lot of different stuff? Programming, English, guitar and reading books. Can I imagine these as a topics? Go back and forth between them, while learning them via blocking technique, Will it lead to a better comprehending them all?

Will it work? Help me understand that. Thank you"
