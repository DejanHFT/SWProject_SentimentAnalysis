What are some things well-rounded fit people should be able to do?,Ronaldoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6om301/what_are_some_things_wellrounded_fit_people/,1030,775,"I'm talking easier goals that most of us can work toward like run a mile in X minutes or do X pushups.

I'm not talking about specialized goals like 1000 lb club or qualifying for the Boston marathon that few people will get. 

This can vary by age and gender so if you can, be specific. I respect that there are gray areas and people who look down on those who can't do what they do.

Bad examples: 

1. Bench press 1000 lbs. (Only a handful of people can do this.)

2. Run a mile within 30 minutes. (Unless your over 90, this shouldn't be a problem.)"
