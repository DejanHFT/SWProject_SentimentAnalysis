Chasing Inspiration or Letting it Come?,evaniscool999,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/11exdaj/chasing_inspiration_or_letting_it_come/,2,2,"I’m sure most of you have heard the iconic Jack London quote, “You can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club,” Which I’m here to ask is it true?

Now I’ve written short stories, drafts never finished, and now I’m on my novel which was originally a draft but now on a fresh draft that’ll be reworked and tossed through the process. I’ve been maintaining a thousand words a day. Sometimes 2, sometimes 3, rarely 500 and even 0 if I’m caught up with life. As a fairly new writer I’ve learned that reading and even watching poetic film and television has improved my writing. 

So I sit here typing on my phone on this sub, looking over at my desk where my desktop lay and I wonder; I’ve written 500 words already today. I’m reading a great book, might watch a movie later. Should I, A. Chase that inspiration with a club, hoping I don’t drain it. Or B. Wait until the morning to write and indulge myself in the medium.

Is Jack London’s quote true? What’s your interpretation?"
