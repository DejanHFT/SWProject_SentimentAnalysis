I live in fear of losing my inspiration,taymsilveira,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/10sbggo/i_live_in_fear_of_losing_my_inspiration/,24,9,"I recently began prioritizing my writing routine. I finally, at long last, took the advice I’ve been receiving from fellow writers/teachers my whole life. To set aside a specific time every day to write; it doesn’t matter if you don’t write anything good that day, just be consistent. Something happened to me in December where, for the first time in my life, I suddenly felt as if I was vibrating with inspiration. I’ve been joking to my friends that I cast a spell for creativity/productivity because it genuinely came out of nowhere. I started writing A LOT and my routine has just become the essential way to start my day. When I’m writing I actually like what I’m writing too, and think it’s good, which is such an amazing feeling. However throughout the rest of the day I’m in an extremely sensitive/emotional state where I’m going through a rollercoaster of emotions. I start to feel convinced that the whole thing is actually garbage and imagine people reading it and laughing. I broke my routine two days ago when I went to write in the morning, and just stared at my laptop with a sinking feeling, terrified that I was on the verge of losing my newfound inspiration. I’m beginning to feel truly insane lol — I am just so sensitive. I’m just wondering if others might relate to this experience because my mind is boggled… lol"
