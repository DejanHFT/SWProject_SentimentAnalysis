How old are the pillars of creation?,platypodus,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/vzux3x/how_old_are_the_pillars_of_creation/,4,14,"I'm trying to find out more about celestial nebulas and ai read that the pillars of creation may already have been destroyed at their location 7000ly away, but how old are they?

It doesn't say anything about how long they've been swirling about for, neither on Wikipedia, nor on their NASA website. Is it something we can't say for sure?"
