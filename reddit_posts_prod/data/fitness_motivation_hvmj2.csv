What Motivated You to Get in Shape? Whats your story?,swbooking,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/hvmj2/what_motivated_you_to_get_in_shape_whats_your/,143,33,"Just out of curiosity, What made you get in shape? Whats your story?

Last night while I was about to finish my workout, I thought, ""I wonder what motivated other Redditors to get in shape"".


Background: 

Always had friends that worked out, did Zone, etc but I never really gave it a second glance. Some time in January my Girlfriend came up to me and asked me if I had ever heard of the Paleo Diet. She explained it to me and something just kinda slapped me in the head and it all just made complete sense. I started reading all I could about it and started following the diet pretty religiously. I said to myself, ""I will never look better then I can look in my 20s. This time period is the peak of my athletic abilities."" So I decided that getting fit, healthy, and in shape would be what I would have to do. There was no chance I was going to let my prime be thrown away. Then after a couple months of dropping weight I started working out and feeling better not only in day to day activities but about myself as well. 


I started out in January pushing 200lbs and now I am sitting right at 170. I feel better in day to day activities, feel more motivated, feel much more confident, and feel like my health overall has greatly increased.


This quote helped too: ""We eat right to look good in clothes, we workout to look good naked."" 


tl;dr: I didn't want to let my 20s slip away and didn't want to look back at pictures when Im old and think, ""I could have done better."""
