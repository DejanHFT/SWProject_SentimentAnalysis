"Can I achieve hypertrophy with less weight, more reps and less rest time?",mike_is87,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9uxc3v/can_i_achieve_hypertrophy_with_less_weight_more/,20,21,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

So for the past months I've been working on increasing my maximum weight capacity. But now I want to work on hypertrophy. Unfortunately I am still a very skinny person so I cannot lift much. As an example, in bench press I can lift 60kg (132 pounds) as maximum, with 90 seconds of rest, and going only to 8 reps.

&#x200B;

But my idea now is to get the muscles tired, so based on the hypertrophy principle, I was wondering if lifting less weight but doing more reps I can achieve it. My goal, of course, is the increase of the mass volume to get bigger.

For example, what if insead of 3x08 60kg resting 90 seconds, I do 5x10 45kg and rest only 60 seconds.

Does it work that way? Am I wrong?

Please feel free to correct me as that would help me.  
Thank you very much."
