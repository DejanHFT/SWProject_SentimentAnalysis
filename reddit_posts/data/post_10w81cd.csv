"Given how rampant harassment is on remote research stations on the Earth, how can we use that knowledge to prevent similar things from happening on the Moon or Mars?",throwaway4abetterday,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/10w81cd/given_how_rampant_harassment_is_on_remote/,465,636,"If you don't know what I'm talking about, do read this: https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/as-antarctic-fieldwork-ends-a-sexual-harassment-reckoning-looms/amp/

Apparently sexual harassment and assault are extremely common in the Antarctic research stations and have been for a very long time.

That has obvious implications for space exploration and colonization as I am sure no potential astronaut wants to become a character in real life Among Us.

So what can we do, now, to help make sure that never happens on a Moon or a Mars base to begin with? The ISS doesn't really have these problems so we know it's possible, and the fact that it's in LEO meaning a skeevy astronaut could still be arrested and held accountable is probably a large factor in that. 

But what about outside of Earth's gravity well? There's light lag between us and the Moon and especially Mars where the lag is upwards of 20 minutes one-way so what do we do if some clown of an astronaut decides to become a real-life Impostor? What do we do then?

Would Earth law even apply on the Moon or Mars?

EDIT: Okay, holy fuck, we're getting actual unironic rape apologia in the comments. I just, I legitimately expected better from humanity. ðŸ˜ž"
