It’s extremely frustrating that people assume that Literature grads have both read every book ever and are outraged by popular/genre fiction,octohussy,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kjq4c2/its_extremely_frustrating_that_people_assume_that/,586,3581,"I graduated from my master’s in Literature several years ago. I was going to do my PhD, but realised that job prospects as a professor would require being open to relocation, something I wasn’t willing to do. My academic interests lay in post-WWII sci-fi, slave narratives and representations of deviancy in literature. 


Since then, I’ve realised that people not only expect you to have read everything ever written, if you have a Literature degree, but also expect you to be only engaged with ‘high-brow’ books that are in the literary canon. In pub quizzes people turn to me on questions about Grisham or Hemingway and don’t believe me when I mention I’ve never read them. There’s this weird assumption that I must adore Austin and all of Shakespeare’s works just because I studied literature. Most bizarrely, some people seem weirdly offended when I haven’t heard of their favourite author. 


It seems rather silly that people expect literature graduates to have read every famous book ever, there’s a bloody awful amount of books in the literary canon. It seems even more ridiculous that people assume that we only ever read ‘high-brow’ works which haven’t been written in the past hundred years. There seems to be this bizarre expectation that popular/contemporary fiction is antithetical to the study of literature. I just wish more people knew that occasionally I want to bosh through trashy romance novels, whilst other times I fancy hitting up some cheesy crime fiction with a bottle of wine. Most of the works I researched as a postgraduate would appeal more to the average person than the caricature of the elitist scholar! Where does this notion of literary elitism even come from?! The vast majority of people I know working in literary academia are exceptionally laid back!


This has been a Christmas Day TED talk brought to you by cheap lager and family interaction.


EDIT: RIP inbox! This blew up whilst I was celebrating.

Im going to respond to a few of the frequent comments I’ve seen. I’m well aware it’s Jane Austen*, but fell victim to autocorrect, so I’m sorry for that! There’s not a great deal of careers linked to getting an MA in Lit outside of academia, and most of my peers who didn’t do PhDs went into marketing. I’m not saying (or bragging) that I don’t enjoy any work in the literary canon, there’s plenty of classics I enjoy! I just haven’t read/enjoyed every classic ever and that’s okay! I made this post as a silly vent about something which has proved a minor annoyance to me. Whilst a few people have responded with weirdly personal insults, I’ve otherwise vastly enjoyed the incredible response to my shitpost! It’s been refreshing hearing all of your stories and I’ve definitely changed some of my perspectives after listening (sorry STEM folk for assuming you were immune to this phenomena!). I’m likely to nod off post-lunch, so I won’t be replying to anyone from now on. Cheers!"
