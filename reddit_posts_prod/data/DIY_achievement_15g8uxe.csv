Concrete Sealer Questions - Diamond Clear Vs Everclear,Motor_Growth_267,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/15g8uxe/concrete_sealer_questions_diamond_clear_vs/,3,1,"Hello there! I am needing to re-seal my sidewalks and drive way around my house (about 1500 sqft.). When calling to place an order for diamond clear and super diamond clear (both Euclid products and recommended by my home builder), they tried selling me Everclear (Euclid product as well). 

My question is this - Everclear is a acrylic based sealer. Diamond clears are both solvent based. They are telling me that Everclear will last longer but I've always heard that solvent based sealers work better and last longer. 

Can anyone smarter than me confirm or deny my suspicions? The Everclear is more expensive too. Thanks for any help here!"
