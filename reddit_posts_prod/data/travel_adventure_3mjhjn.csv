4am Hostel Adventures,spids69,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3mjhjn/4am_hostel_adventures/,50,88,"4am and into the room come three people, who turn on the light, chat, and argue. One of these guys isn't even from our room. He chats up the Aussie girl next to me, ""whispers"" her a story about his missing passport and convinces her to let him bunk with her. They proceed to make out, two feet away from me. Light finally goes off. I consider losing my passport.

Other two folks have started angrily arguing over him helping find her phone. She wants him to call it. He is not happy about it, but angrily complies. The two next to me have now progressed to heavy making out and, shall we say, ""hand stuff"".

Arguing people have now found phone. She is now lighting the room up with it and he's snoring loudly. Couple next to me are now full on jackrabbiting, complete with lightly moaned dirty talk. I do my best to not see the worst sex show in Amsterdam, but the surround sound is crystal clear.

Other Aussie girl now stumbles in and Aussie number one makes guy pause, hurriedly, suddenly knowing shame, or something. Aussie 2 is drunk and oblivious. She spends around 10 minutes rummaging and dropping things, cursing under her breath. I consider the possibility that so many things are legal in Amsterdam, perhaps they won't even try me for murder.

She finally goes in the bathroom, allowing Aussie number one and her gentleman friend the ""privacy"" they need to finish up. He finishes, passes out, and starts snoring. Guy in bunk above me starts snoring in response. Angry guy from earlier is still sawing off a nice bass, to round out the trio. I consider the merits of street sleeping.

Aussie 2 is still banging around the bathroom, and showering. The snoring lover occasionally wakes up, for noisy 15-30 second kisses, before lapsing back into dragon shaking snores... Like a champ. 

I'm now debating with myself as to whether or not 4 hours of sleep will do, as I'm clearly not getting back to sleep tonight. Aussie 2 is out now. Maybe I'll noisily shower and see what sunrise in Amsterdam is like...
