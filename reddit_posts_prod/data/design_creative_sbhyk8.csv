Do other designers feel like marketers limit out creative potential?,MyHoloLove,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/sbhyk8/do_other_designers_feel_like_marketers_limit_out/,12,16,So a year ago i started working at a E-Commerce company lets call it **X .** so in the first 4 months i had fun working as i was still getting to know the company so on my 5th month i was promoted to design lead and i mainly handled the website graphics and UI/UX of the website. ever since since that day i started working closely with the marketing team and i feel like they are complete idiots. when i handled the companies social media in the starting i felt like i did a good job as the designs paid off but on the website every good design i make the marketer suggest changes that ruins typography and the Colors just go to shit For eg using too much red on a yellow BG i was specially told to do this it looked so shit that i would vomit they simply don't pay attention to aesthetics. stupid changes like this have been going on and on just for 1 reason they think people will click on red because it hits there eyes i cannot deny this fact its true but how do i make them understand same can be done by using red in just one place where its needed not not all text needs to be bold only the important words can be bold. do any of u have such an experience or am i being unreasonable here. every design that i make that looks aesthetically nice just goes to shit once the marketing team steps in i seriously want to punch them in the face but i would be better if they understood what i am trying to say any suggestion as to how do i manipulate these devils?
