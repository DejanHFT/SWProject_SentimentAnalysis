Help Reddit!  I have information about AT&T's illicit business practices and I need help making it count! ,wannabewistleblower,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/heoem/help_reddit_i_have_information_about_atts_illicit/,550,679,"I know an AT&T project lead, and my heart began to race as she broke down and went on (yet another) rant about work.  She was ranting about the insane ways AT&T allocates their money and manages their projects, essentially pitting them against each other.  

In the course of the conversation I said the magic words “How can the company run itself like this?  No wonder they have such shitty service!”  Then the dam broke.  I hate myself for not having my cell on me to record the words that followed; I would have posted them everywhere.

In her own words, AT&T runs off of “funny money”.  Everything that runs through the projects that manage infrastructure management and upgrades to their networks (both wireless and wired) is marked up and sold between their departments and the people who execute them.  They sell it in-house like it’s a service.  Why?  Because it qualifies as tax deductible if it isn’t seen as capital being spent by the company, instead it’s an expense that’s outsourced. 

Projects are supposed to run off of little or no actual capital to finish tasks or solve problems such as large occurring or looming outages.  They instead pitch these things as if it’s being bought from another company.  If they need technicians to install hardware to handle more customers or traffic, it costs her department at AT&T over $7000 in fake labor charges from the techs from AT&T to get it done. The superfluous markup allows them to inflate their expenses to write off, and doubles as a way to pad the amount they can claim it takes to upkeep their networks when being attacked over metered usage and tiered access to services.

That’s not all! Anyone who is astute at running a major corporation might wonder how you keep the reins on how much money actually flying around in this system.   They don’t.  When someone gets caught holding the bag, they lose the game and everything goes apeshit (in other words you lose your job), so the idea is to pass that buck as far as it can go.  Right this moment there’s an outage that isn’t being resolved, not because AT&T doesn’t have the resources to fix it, but because no one is willing to bump that “capital” expense up on their project the $11,000 to pay someone in the department to fix the problem.

It’s a great system for the executives at AT&T at the top though; they can have their cake and eat it too.  You see, they get to say their dumping all these resources into a beleaguered network that due to what they claim is rampant bandwidth usage is unable to handle customer load so they have an excuse to charge customers more, and they use the system to make sure no one spends any actual money in infrastructure maintenance and upgrades.  No one is willing to get their project in trouble by paying the other projects money for anything they don’t have to within AT&T’s own budget, so the bare minimum gets done, but it sure looks like a lot of money gets spent that way, and they get all the tax breaks and leeway for keeping their network up and running even though they don’t.

Who actually pays for that markup though?  Where does it go?  Nowhere. It isn’t real money, but she also charged that they system allows them to manipulate their stock prices artificially, which their stock standing is essentially the bar that project leads are to measure their money management, and a lot of seedy things have been happening lately (I couldn’t get her to comment further, but I suspect it’s used in investor reports to artificially show growth over expenses which are of course bloated with fake money).  

This is what AT&T is really seeking to protect with buying out its competition.  They are not in the business of providing a service for a price in a traditional marketplace, but with providing the bare minimum of service quality and reap all of the profits and benefits of being such a provider in the eyes of the government and the world at large.  There is no incentive for them to upgrade their products and increase their bandwidth load if their artificially created expenses can earn the people at the top cash and prizes (especially in the form of manipulated stock values).  Instead they want to make the internet conform to their meager network so they don’t have to actually spend the capital to run a nationwide ISP and wireless network provider.

Why is this in askReddit?  Because I have no idea what to do with this information.  It wasn’t recorded (I really want to kill myself over not having my blackberry on me and hitting the record button), and I’m not so sure she’d out this information in public in fear of losing her six figure job.  I’ll do anything to prove this and force this sort of corruption to be stamped out, so I’m up for anything folks.


**TL;DR** I have important information about AT&T's corrupt business practices and I need help doing something with it
