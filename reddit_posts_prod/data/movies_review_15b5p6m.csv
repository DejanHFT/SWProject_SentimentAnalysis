>Cowabunga!


[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2023/07/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-review-seth-rogen-e-best-tmnt-movie-yet-1235449141/):

>Fans will not be disappointed with any of the decisions here, notably the scattershot animation that feels rough around the edges, stylish, anti-CGI blandness, and visually surprising and satisfying.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-review-seth-rogen-1235680377/):

>The movie’s mostly just meant to be fun, and that it is, skewing young while giving lifelong fans (including those who grew up on the Turtles) plenty to geek out about. 


[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-review-2023-1234887640/) (B):

>The heart of “Mutant Mayhem” is pure, and the look of it is sprightly and unique, making it a worthy new addition to a franchise that clearly still has new stories to tell.


[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-review/):

>The result is both as original and predictable as you’d expect. In that regard, “Mutant Mayhem” hardly feels like something you’ve never experienced before. But considering how over-exploited this particular IP is, co-directors Jeff Rowe (of the wonderful “The Mitchells vs. the Machines”) and Kyler Spears still deserve praise for having some light and stylish fun with their standalone chapter that moves just right through an economic 90+ minutes without overstaying its welcome despite some occasionally overworked story machinations. 


[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-review/) (4/5):

>Turtle Power is back, thanks to a potent combo of winning humour and gnarly animation. Cowabunga!

[ScreenCrush](https://screencrush.com/ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-review/) (7/10):

>It turns this very familiar concept into something fresh.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/27/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-review-evergreen-superheroes-jackie-chan-ice-cube-giancarlo-esposito) (3/5):

>This new animated origin story for the chelonian adventurers is unexpectedly funny, with a rather stylish crepuscular design.
