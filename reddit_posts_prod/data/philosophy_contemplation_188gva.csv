How is utilitarian decision making and uncertainty reconciled? ,onejiveassturkey,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/188gva/how_is_utilitarian_decision_making_and/,8,13,"Just to intro this question: I'm not extremely well read in philosophical texts but I'd like to get your input on how authors have answered this question, and perhaps do some self-studying based on your recommendations. I'm here to learn baby!

Utilitarian decision making seems clearly logical when there is an element of certainty. For example, the situation that always gets brought up: You're standing on a cliff edge with a train switchtrack lever. An oncoming train may kill two people, but if you pull the lever it will change routes and only kill one. Thus you choose to kill one, to maximize the utility and happiness, etc. 

But how could the decision of pulling the lever be made if you didn't have 100% certainty of the consequences? This is where deontological ethics is brought up; if you intended to save the most people, then the ethical component of the chain of events involved the choice to pull the lever despite the uncertainty of it's effects, because of positive intention. So does utilitarianism become a retrospective ethic? Is the morality captured in the contemplation and calculation itself? Or is there an a priori morality in making a decision that may have uncertain results? Is making a moral decision whereby one is conscientiously aware of one's *lack* of certainty inherently immoral by nature of the chance of it turning out worse than expected? How is this approached?
