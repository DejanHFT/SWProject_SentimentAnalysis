"Best Strategy RPGs, what's yours?",TGC_Karlsanada13,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/wzjxgo/best_strategy_rpgs_whats_yours/,30,4,"I am a huge fan of Strategy/Tactical RPG, and I love the fact that it is having a sort of resurgence for the past few years considering the success of Fire Emblem, XCOM, and a bunch of indie games (Into the Breach and Othercide) that focuses on Strategy RPGs. 

I have made a list of the best strategy RPGs to play in most of the modern platforms.

Recently, I played The Banner Saga Trilogy, and the fact that incorporated choices although minor can devastate your whole caravan in the long run. XCOM: Enemy Within and XCOM 2 are great strategy RPG, I have not tried the spin off but I believe they are worth noting.

Tactics Ogre: Reborn is almost out.(November 11) However, I still think Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions deserve a remaster, but it is playable on mobile phones. A switch remaster would be really nice.

How about you, what is your top 10?"
