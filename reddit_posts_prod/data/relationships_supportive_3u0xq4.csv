I [23F] feel like my husband [36M] is not supportive of our family. Not sure if I have unreasonable expectations.,SadAndLonelyWife,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3u0xq4/i_23f_feel_like_my_husband_36m_is_not_supportive/,72,74,"Reddit, I need your help.

I feel like all of my confidence is gone. I haven't been able to pin point it for a while, but I think now I have it figured out. I've been married to my husband for over three years.

He is so critical of everything I do. Whenever I make a decision for myself, he gets mad at me for not making the ""right"" decision. When I try to talk to him about decisions, he just tells me to do what I want. When I let him make a decision, he gets criticizes me for not making my own decisions.

He won't get a job. This wouldn't be a problem if he did housework. But he does not. When I ask him to do something, he usually sleeps in and says he doesn't have time. I thought that maybe he was too busy watching our 2-year-old, but that's not the case. His mom lives with us and watches the girl. I've asked her several times what she's done, and were my husband was. She does most of the cooking and watching the kid. My husband's and mother-in-law's stories match up.

My husband first cited that he wouldn't get a job because he needed to focus on classes. Great! He was a part-time student. Comes to find out he did about none of his homework, and barely attended classes. He won't go to the library if he needs a quiet place (it is open 24/7 to students). He even has the car, or can take the bus. He refused. He just dropped out of all of his classes. No talk of a job or any other plans yet.

Where am I? I am a full-time student and work part-time in IT. I do what I can, but I am just so exhausted, I can't do it all. That, and rent + utilities eat about 70% of my paycheck.

I haven't felt well the last 3 days, so all I could do was go to class, work and come home and rest. The apartment is impossible to navigate now. My husband has done no cleaning. He said it himself: he has slept and played video games the whole time.

The only thing he really does for me is drive me places. I cannot physically drive the car, as it is a stick shift. I do know how to drive it, I just can't! The clutch pedal requires me to push it in a way that is very, very hard on my leg. Because of this, he also makes any doctor appointments for me, since he's the one to drive me. I would get something I can drive, but I simply do not have the money. (I'm hoping to get a nice used car and maintain it well, since that seems the most cost-effective.)

Every time I bring up one of our problems with my husband so we can work it out, he always gets defensive and insults me. I feel like the only problems that are acceptable to him, are when they're all my fault. I know I'm not perfect and I work on my problems if they are indeed an issue. (An example of a non-issue to me is his problem with me not letting him buy more tablet game add-ons. Normally I don't mind, but we don't have the money! If we could afford it, I would allow more luxuries.)

Why doesn’t he do any of the money stuff? Well, he spends all of the money in his bank account of things he doesn’t need: games, movies, etc. When it comes time to pay rent or car insurance, or anything like that, he doesn’t have the money. It is especially bad during student aid disbursement time and tax refund time. I tried impressing upon him that we need to save the money for bills, but he blows it all away within a month! Then we needed to set up payment plans or pay late. So I wrote down pretty much all of our bills and when they were due, but he wasn’t interested. So I do the money stuff so the family is fed and clothed. Now he likes to say I’m controlling and he has to “beg me to get anything.” He gets his World of Warcraft subscription; I haven’t been able to get the new glasses I needed or new bras that fit. I think I was being quite fair.

Also, we’re looking at new places to live (since it’s expensive to live here) and every time I find a place that’s in budget, there is something wrong with the place. I’m not talking about something as bad as a leaky roof, poor insulation, or a high-crime neighborhood; I mean stuff like the wrong type of tree is in the backyard. (Not even the kind anyone in our family is allergic to!) I would get a place that meets his laundry list of demands, but I simply can’t afford it! He acts like I wish death to the family if I were to sign a lease to a place with a rogue tree. (I wish that was an exaggeration.)

He says something like all of his dreams are ruined; he didn’t get the degree he wanted because his home environment prevented him from getting his homework done. But there was the library to go to, and the environment was good enough to play video games. And he’s planning to get a different related, but easier to get, degree. He refuses to talk about his other dreams that have been, as he says, “ruined.”

When we have a disagreement, whenever I try to make a point, I’m “beating him over the head” with things and “never forgiving him.” I would understand if I said something like “You’re a lazy sack of doody! Get off your butt!” but I say stuff like “Hey, I’ve noticed you haven’t gotten to this task you said you were going to do. Have you been busy with other things? Do you need something else to get your job done?” According to him, this is beating him over the head. I try to give him a few days to get stuff done and cut him some slack if he has done other work-type things. I also try to understand if he doesn’t have the necessary tools. I even understand a day or two break! But I digress…

Also, on the never forgiving front, I would understand if it was a transgression that happened a while back, and it’s stopped, but it’s not. When I try to talk about something, I tell him what has upset me. He may reply that that was only once or twice. Then I bring up the other times he’s done the bad thing. Then it’s “I would expect you to never forgive me!” Huh??? A few other replies he uses against me…

* “Oh, but you do it too!” When I didn’t. He can’t give examples. If I did do it, I make an effort to not do the bad thing again. 

* “Oh, but your family does [bad thing] too!” He never brings up these things unless it’s during a disagreement. I know my family would respect his wishes if I asked them to stop; they would probably do it if he asked nicely.

* “I don’t see why it’s an issue!” Ouch… I feel like my feelings don’t matter.

* “Oh, I’m sorry that I upset you.” I ask him if he is sorry that he did the bad thing. The answer has always been no. He uses this very mean passive-aggressive tone with these words, too. I might be imagining that, though.

To be fair, I was a horrible wife in the beginning of our relationship. But I tried to talk it out with him, and I think I’ve really improved on the things he’s told me about. (At least, I thought I was a bad wife… writing this out, maybe I was actually normal?)

When we had a big fight not too long ago, he told me that if I left, he'd get full custody of our kid, and run away across the country so I wouldn't be able to see her. He cites my mental health problems, and my other health problems. I'm working on the physical front, and I was in bad shape mentally when we first met because I was homeless for a while, and I was also in several abusive relationships in the past. I think I'm fine (at least functional), and have made great strides towards a healthy mind. A high priority for me if for my daughter to be safe; I don’t think he’d take good care of her. This is upsetting.

/r/relationships is this normal? I don't want this situation for myself, so what do I do? Am I making a mountain out of a molehill? Am I being unreasonable? I'll be happy to fill any gaps I left if it would help you help me.

(I apologize if this is scatter-brained. My writing skills need some work!)

tl;dr I feel like my husband is uncaring and doesn't want to change. Not sure what to do.
