Running : notify when distance achieved?,killermouse0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5aoiac/running_notify_when_distance_achieved/,6,1,"Hey guys! 

I'm trying to get back to running and I'm totally out of shape. I want to pace myself though, and avoid going crazy for a week and giving up after a month or so... 

I'm looking for an app which can tell me when I reach my distance goal. Like ""you reached your 2.3 km goal"". 

Do you know anything like that? 

Phone is Android. 

Many thanks! "
