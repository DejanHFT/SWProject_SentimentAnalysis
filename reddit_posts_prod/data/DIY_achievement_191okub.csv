Soundproofing Window,cubesmaster,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/191okub,3,0,"Hiya folks,

I'm renting this apartment unit that has this massive glass window panels overlooking a pretty busy street (even at night).


Installing double window pane or even sound dampening curtains are out of the question because both options are not only very expensive but also involves making some pretty significant changes in the room (I'm renting the place).


So that leaves me to white noise which I've tried with varying success. Some night it works fine, some night I just can't seem to zone out from the street noise (especially when some sports cars are passing by).


Which brings me to my next question, can I use acoustic sealant to help reduce the noise? Will it work on my windows? If yes, how should I apply the sealant to achieve the best results?


You can see the pictures attached to know what I'm dealing with in more details. The windows have its existing rubber seal, so I was wondering if the sealant should/can be applied on top of them. Thanks!"
