Space and astronomy subreddits being hit with posts bordering on trolling and conspiracies,MrFahrenheit_451,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/in35js/space_and_astronomy_subreddits_being_hit_with/,27,115,"Last 2 days I’ve noticed a significant increase in trolling on /r/space and /r/astronomy and postings of conspiracies. Is there a rule that deals with these?  I checked the rules and couldn’t specifically see one.  I don’t know why people would get such gratification from posting images and such, trolling about going to space being fake. 

Should these just be reported as “misinformation” or ... ?"
