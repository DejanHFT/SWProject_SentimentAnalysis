What historical figures don't have voices like we might typically imagine?,Dufils,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/c0js71/what_historical_figures_dont_have_voices_like_we/,924,4224,"The inspiration from this came after hearing audio of both [Stalin](https://youtu.be/SW9PDj1jqRU) and [Patton](https://youtu.be/G9DpKDwCJcM), whose voices are a lot higher and 'scratchy' than the voice I would have associated with them.

Are there any other examples of historical figures whose voice is different than what people might perceive them to be?"
