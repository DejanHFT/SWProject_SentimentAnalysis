New England Islands - Worth Exploring?,gnarlidrum,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zy2zaf/new_england_islands_worth_exploring/,4,1,"I’m a surfer traveler originally from NJ currently residing in VA. I’ve done some pretty great exploring up and down the east coast and have an unusual appreciation for it, and some of the places that tourists never get to or try to see. I love coastal gems, lighthouses, and quirky villages on the coast.

Are the New England Islands (Block, Martha’s Vineyard, Nantucket) worth exploring? If I could only visit 1 or 2, which should they be? Or are they more of a wealthy tourist attraction? I’ve never been, and I know I want to go up to Maine this year and am not sure if I should make them part of the journey. 

Side Note: 
I’m a major SUV and 4x4 nerd and the Martha’s Vineyard/Nantucket Land Rover culture is intriguing so that might sway me to at least visit one of them."
