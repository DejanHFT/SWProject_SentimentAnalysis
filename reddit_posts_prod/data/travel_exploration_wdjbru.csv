Our ship, the Argus had left port with one key logistical item still missing on board; our amazing pilot Thomas from Helitrans and his Airbus H125. He would be key in moving all material from ship and deploy all drilling equipment in the field once we arrived in Mestersvig.

Safety procedure did not allow the helicopter to land on the Argus within the port facility so Thomas had to catch up with us on the open sea. It does come in very practical to have a pilot with extensive experience in Ship/Helicopter Operating Limits in the team to ensure for a safe landing of this expensive piece of machinery and shows just how many logistical details have to be accounted for to deliver a successful mission. Interesting observation regarding air traffic control, even on days of the H125 not being in operation, Thomas still had to report daily to the flight control centre in Nuuk to confirm no flight operations as part of safety protocols.

Talking about safety, the procedure for using the H125 did not allow for us to commute from ship to land during setting up the camp. We had to use the Zodiac for this and only avoided having to put on immersion/survival suits every time as the distance to shore was less than 300meters. However the two members of crew operating the Zodiac did have to wear the full kit every time as part of the safety procedure.

Coming back to the flight control centre in Nuuk. Being in a far remote place its clear you do not have any permanent radio contact with air traffic control. Our pilot Thomas still had to report every 3hours with a schedule summary once we started operations in Mestersvig. Failing to do so would trigger an alarm followed by a Search and Rescue Mission to provide an additional layer of safety in case the local radio communication “expedition crew-base camp-pilot” would fail. Good feeling to know you will be missed rather sooner than later…

And now out at sea for the next 2-3 days on our way to King Oscars Fjord in Scoresby Land, Northeast Greenland.
