Reviews (will update as more come in):

David Rooney - [Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/lightyear-pixar-chris-evans-1235162798/)

>Since ranking now seems obligatory, this is solid mid-tier Pixar with plenty of kid appeal and a significant nostalgia factor for fans of ‘80s and ‘90s sci-fi. It can’t touch the studio’s space-age masterpiece, *Wall-E.* But the beauty of the outer-space environments and the expressive charm of the characters should make this play well as the first Pixar release to hit theaters since the pandemic began. That includes IMAX screens, with parts of the film specifically shot in the larger format.

>To its credit, “Lightyear” has visual pizzazz, from the hyperspace sequences to the heretofore hidden surprises that emerge from those colorful buttons and dials on the Space Ranger uniforms. Ultimately, however, this film gives the world a new reason not to see a movie: “No thanks, I read the book” is now “No thanks, I played with the toy.”

>Following Pixar’s two most refreshing releases in years, **“Luca**” and “**Turning Red,”** both of which were deemed unworthy of a full theatrical release, it’s difficult not to perceive “Lightyear” as a far less compelling and safe bet. How tiresome it is that most studio productions must now exist as part of a larger multiverse in order to merit exposure. In the end, “Lightyear” reveals that today, given Disney’s business model, “to infinity and beyond” really only means to the inevitable sequel.

>What ultimately waters down *Lightyear*, an otherwise polished, gorgeous-looking entry into the Pixar oeuvre, is an absence of the excitement and disciplined storytelling spirit that made *Toy Story* such a pioneering hit. Even Michael Giacchino’s splendid score goes only so far towards insinuating a grand adventure that ultimately feels a little trite and bloated. Aiming for infinity and beyond, *Lightyear* frustratingly feels trapped on earth.

>It’s not that good; it’s still very much a commercially motivated piece of art with multi-platform media franchise aspirations. However, nobody involved phoned it in. Aduba is terrific as Buzz’s teammate (yes, she’s gay and kisses her wife at a key narrative juncture and no I don’t think it’ll affect the box office to any major degree), while Whitlock Jr. lends his distinct vocals and offers slight shading to what could have been a stock “disapproving superior” part. Oh, and Peter Sohn winningly voices Sox, a robot cat who (not surprisingly) steals the entire movie. Hey, if Disney wants to make a Sox streaming show or spin-off movie, I’ll happily watch that. Otherwise, *Lightyear* is the movie you expected, clear in its motivations but made by folks unwilling to completely color within the lines.

>Despite its messy plot and underwhelming villain, the strong voice performances and stunning visuals — and, of course, Sox the cat — make Lightyear a solid space adventure.

>""Lightyear"" may not reach the heights of the great sci-fi movies that it pays tribute to, or even the ""Toy Story"" movies themselves. But it's a visually impressive, escapist riff on the sci-fi epic that, at the very least, might become the favorite movie of some kid, somewhere.

Ross Bonaime - [Collider](https://collider.com/lightyear-review-chris-evans-toy-story-pixar/) (B-)

>*Lightyear* is still an extremely fun action sci-fi film that is better than most animated films released in a given year, and will bring a smile to fans of this character. But it also is the first time a *Toy Story* film has truly felt inessential, like *Lightyear* is trying to show that the opportunities for this franchise can still go to infinity and beyond, yet it’s hard to watch and not wish that Pixar had gone beyond what they know works and focus on more exciting and unique properties. Pixar once showed us that Buzz and these characters were more than just toys, and by expanding this story in this way, *Lightyear* feels like little more than a child’s plaything.

>“Finish the mission” may be a flawed mantra, but it loses all of its punch in a film whose purpose is so uncertain from the start. The pandemic has certainly played a part in the company’s strategy, but if Disney continues to pump retrograde franchise spinoffs into theaters while forcing people to watch the likes of “Luca” and “Turning Red” on TV, it won’t be long until fans settle in on T’Kani Prime and lose interest in leaving home. Yesterday it was “to infinity and beyond!” Tomorrow it might be “no further than the couch.”

Valerie Complex - [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2022/06/lightyear-review-chris-evans-is-the-voice-1235044584/)

>Lightyear doesn’t rely too much on Toy Story lore to build its own world, but it would have benefited showing some connection to that part of the franchise instead of using title cards to do so. Much like in Toy Story, Lightyear finds a way to play well with others, regardless of heroics, and often his diverse group of companions are more interesting than he is. Izzy, Mo, and Darby have their own talents that are useful in getting Buzz out of trouble.

Synopsis:

>A sci-fi action adventure and the definitive origin story of Buzz Lightyear, the hero who inspired the toy, *Lightyear* follows the legendary Space Ranger after he’s marooned on a hostile planet 4.2 million light-years from Earth alongside his commander and their crew. As Buzz tries to find a way back home through space and time, he’s joined by a group of ambitious recruits and his charming robot companion cat, Sox. Complicating matters and threatening the mission is the arrival of Zurg, an imposing presence with an army of ruthless robots and a mysterious agenda.
