Help me find that amazing melancholy cover of Oh Darling,Nikka9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/195y03x/help_me_find_that_amazing_melancholy_cover_of_oh/,7,0,"I recently heard an incredible cover of the Beatles' ""Oh Darling"". It was playing at a restaurant and I didn't Shazam it in time.
It was played in a minor key instead of the song's original major key, and the singer had a feminine voice. It had a rock vibe to it, the chorus was very energetic and the verses were slow and sad. 
I've listened to countless covers of this song trying trying to find this specific cover, without any luck.
Can any music wizards help?"
