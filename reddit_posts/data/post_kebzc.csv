Have you ever been embarassed for someone elses stupidity?,shenanigins,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kebzc/have_you_ever_been_embarassed_for_someone_elses/,92,27,"I'm currently taking a GE science class, it's ridiculously simple. Basically middle school science stuff. Anyways, we're doing a lab that gives you step by step instructions on how to do the thing, it's a computer program. It even tells you when to stop and answer which questions. My partner and I finished in about 30 mins. But, we need class data so we have to wait. It took us about an hour of waiting to get more data. It's interesting to see how confused computers make people.

So, reddit, when has someone done something stupid that makes you embarassed for them?"
