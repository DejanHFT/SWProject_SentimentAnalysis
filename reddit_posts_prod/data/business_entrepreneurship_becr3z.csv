Invitation to a research project on Entrepreneurship and Neurological Diversity,johanwiklund12,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/becr3z/invitation_to_a_research_project_on/,0,0,"As in the previous post, I invited those who are running a business or intend to run a business to take part in a new exciting research project linking insights in psychology and neuroscience to entrepreneurship. The project is called Entrepreneurship and Neurological Diversity. It focuses on certain psychological traits, self-care, and entrepreneurial outcomes. To date, over 100 entrepreneurs have already taken the survey! 

As a participant, you can receive your own personal profile, as well as a written summary of the findings so that you can benchmark yourself against other entrepreneurs. Here is the link to the survey: [Entrepreneurship and Neurological Diversity survey ](https://syracuseuniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bjdAKTi3bd9kq3j) .Please spend a little time taking the survey.
