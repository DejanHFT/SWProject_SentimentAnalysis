'Borat 2' - Review Thread,BunyipPouch,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/jffnys/borat_2_review_thread/,760,1067,"Review embargo just lifted for *Borat 2: Subsequent MovieFilm*. Looks really solid/positive so far, with a few mixed reviews calling it overshadowed by the original, about as expected. Actually pretty good results for a comedy, especially a sequel. Comedy sequels usually get trashed. 

**Rotten Tomatoes:** [85% - 62 Reviews - 7.02 Average](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borat_subsequent_moviefilm)

**Rotten Tomatoes Consensus:**

> Fourteen years after his last theatrical outing, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm proves Sacha Baron Cohen's comedic creation remains a sharp tool for exposing the most misguided -- or outright repugnant -- corners of American culture.

**Metacritic:** [67/100 - 31 Reviews - ""Generally Favorable Reviews""](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/borat-subsequent-moviefilm-delivery-of-prodigious-bribe-to-american-regime-for-make-benefit-once-glo)

[Indiewire:](https://www.indiewire.com/2020/10/borat-2-review-1234594290/) 

> A brilliant, vulgar plea for a better world. Baron Cohen resurrects his most confrontational character for the ultimate indictment of America in 2020, and he hits his target many times over.

[Digital Spy:](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a34426812/borat-2-review-subsequent-moviefilm-amazon/)

> A shocking and hilarious return for Sacha Baron Cohen. Very nice!

[Slashfilm:](https://www.slashfilm.com/borat-2-review/)

> Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is easily the funniest movie of 2020. That’s not exactly difficult in a year when there are barely any new comedies to challenge it for the title, but even in a year with stacked comedies, I’m confident this sequel would undeniably come out on top of the pack.

[USA Today:](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2020/10/21/borat-2-review-sacha-baron-cohen-mocks-trump-scattershot-sequel/5999637002/?utm_campaign=snd-autopilot)

> The absolute commitment to the over-the-top Borat persona continues to be admirable.

[Globe & Mail:](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/reviews/article-sacha-baron-cohens-borat-sequel-is-a-jaw-dropping-masterpiece-of/)

> An essential piece of 2020 culture, distilling the mania of this cursed year into a compact 95 minutes of jaw-dropping cringe comedy.

[AVClub:](https://film.avclub.com/borat-subsequent-moviefilm-brings-sacha-baron-cohen-s-f-1845433727)

> Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is frequently funny and occasionally pointed, more than enough to recommend it as a comedy.

[Associated Press:](https://apnews.com/article/film-reviews-virus-outbreak-movies-sacha-baron-cohen-michael-pence-414f7e11088d7a9b9a1b2cc2fde7bc01)

> The ""Borat"" sequel will make you laugh and squirm as much as it will send shudders down your spine.

[Detroit News:](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2020/10/21/review-borat-subsequent-moviefilm-lacks-bite-insight-original/5989771002/)

> ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" has fleeting moments of inspiration, but it's overly reliant on cheap provocations, gross-out gags and obvious humor.

[The Wrap:](https://www.thewrap.com/borat-subsequent-moviefilm-film-review-sasha-baron-cohen-sequel/)

> Sasha Baron Cohen valiantly fails to resuscitate the corpse of satire. If we want to see Americans - the famous kind or the average citizen - reveal their darkest, cruelest, most horrible opinions, we can just get on social media. Baron Cohen putting on a wig and an accent and showing up with a camera is no longer necessary.

[Hollywood Reporter:](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/borat-subsequent-moviefilm-film-review)

> This joke isn't funny anymore.

[Collider:](https://collider.com/borat-2-review-amazon-prime-video-sacha-baron-cohen/)

> Rating: B - The film’s climax is definitely going to get people talking, but I hope it doesn’t overshadow some A+ comedy that had me crying from laughing so hard. It’s not a great success, but it’s a pretty good success.

[Variety:](https://variety.com/2020/film/reviews/borat-subsequent-moviefilm-review-sacha-baron-cohen-1234811698/)

> A searing sequel to the hit 2006 satire designed to shake up the election. Borat is an idiot, but ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" ends on a pretty smart note.

[ScreenSlate:](https://www.screenslate.com/articles/389) 

> Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is undisguised liberal propaganda. But for most people the important question is: does Borat still say ""mai waif,"" and is it still funny?
