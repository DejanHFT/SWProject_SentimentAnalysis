Has ‘A Serbian Film’ lost its shock value?,grahamsm123,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/17hxaui/has_a_serbian_film_lost_its_shock_value/,29,0,"
I’ll start by saying I don’t think this is a good film by any stretch but the amount of notoriety surrounding it at this point feels almost unearned? It was vaulted into cult classic status for its taboo pushing elements and yet it pulls back on actually showing the most graphic and controversial aspects of it. I’m not sure how someone could watch movies like Irreversible or Martyrs and not feel more shaken up by far more visceral and not to mention better films. Not too mention that those movies that came from the French Extremity movement had something to say while Serbian Film feels rather trite and kind of desperate to stun the audience but ends up going out with a whimper as opposed to a gut punch like an effective social critique should accomplish."
