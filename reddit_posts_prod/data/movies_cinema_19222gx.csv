This is your reminder to watch Bullet Train (2022) especially if you didn't catch it in the cinema,Limp-Munkee69,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/19222gx/this_is_your_reminder_to_watch_bullet_train_2022/,881,7057,"Bullet Train is one of those movies that kinda flew under the radar, while still very much not flying under the radar if that makes sense.

Every major YouTube reviewer talked about it, most people had atleast heard about it, it made descent money, but man, it's too good compared how little a dent it made in Pop culture.

Most people I know haven't seen it. And finding one who has is like finding your best friend at an event you didn't know both of you were going to.

It's a colorful, fun, emotional, and fast ride through japan. Excellently shot. With an insanemy good cast, and some pretty good pondering on the nature of unknowable forces such as luck and fate.

A mystery that just keeps going, and plot that never stops and characters that live rent free in my mind and heart.

If you like style AND substance. Bullet Train is for you."
