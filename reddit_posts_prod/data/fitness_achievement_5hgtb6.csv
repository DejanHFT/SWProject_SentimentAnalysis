Achieving muscle soreness with heavy weights,haplesslife,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5hgtb6/achieving_muscle_soreness_with_heavy_weights/,17,1,"For the better part of since I started lifting I've generally stuck with higher weights and lower reps in order to build muscle mass. Earlier this week I tried a quad workout using lower weights and far more than usual reps at a high intensity (e.g. 30-50 reps of smith machine sumo + regular squats). This completely destroyed me and had me barely able to walk the next two days in the *best* way possible.

My question is how am I able to recapture that feeling using higher weights and lower reps (6-9 range) or if I'm even supposed to in that case. With higher weights I genuinely feel as if I'm pushing myself to failure and doing my max weight possible, but at the same time I'm barely ever breaking a sweat and feel minimal soreness after each workout. I've been struggling to make solid gains for months now and feel this is related. Am I doing something wrong here?"
