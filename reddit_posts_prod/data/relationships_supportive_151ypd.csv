"I [40F] am pregnant after unsuccessful attempts and miscarriages. My current fiance [30M] isn't supportive, and it is breaking my heart. ",Todramolo,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/151ypd/i_40f_am_pregnant_after_unsuccessful_attempts_and/,772,422,"Me: 39F
Him: 30M 
Length of relationship: 2 years

For years, I struggled with fertility. I have had countless chemical pregnancies, 5 miscarriages, 1 late miscarriage, and 1 extremely early birth where my son passed away just hours after being born. It was heart wrenching. I was married ( to someone else) at the time and the struggle this created led to our divorce. 

We tried IVF and even considered adoption. All to no success. The adoption thing could have happened, but my husband and I at the time decided to keep trying. 

The death of our baby really shock both of us. I still can't look at a photo of him. It just hurts too much. 

Then my husband got really depressed about it all, and this led to eventual suicide. I blamed myself for a long time. It took me almost 5 years to start dating again. By then I was quickly approaching 40 and ,in what my doctors would tell me, going through a possible early menopause ( hot flashes, hormonal changes). I assumed that my time was up. I wasn't meant to have kids.    

I started to turn my life around and started to date a bit. I even moved to a new state for a new lease on life. I started dating a younger man. 

We used protection, and nothing happened for two years. Then it did. And now I am pregnant. And I am 40 and this might be my last shot at this. 

I found out 5 weeks ago and I kept it a secret from him because I had been in that situation so many times that I couldn't take having to tell someone I had a miscarriage again. I figure it is probably going to happen anyway. 12 weeks rolls around and I see my doctor. I am still pregnant. The traditional danger zone is finished so I decide it is time to tell the fiance. 

He was livid, and frustrated and a ton of other emotions that are completely normal for someone in the situation. He tells me that he doesn't ever want kids and that is why he was with someone like me. 

I understand where he is coming and I consider the abortion just like he asks me to. For three days that is all I think about. We discuss it at length. I even talk to a therapist about it. 

Then one day I am sitting in the park by the river and I see these kids on there bikes and all I can think about it that I want a chance. I want a chance to be a parent, and this looks like it might be my one and only. I am not even sure if I can carry a child to term, but what if this is the one that survives? 

He knows about my past fertility issues and all the problems I had. He even knows about the baby that died. He knows I tried so hard for so long. "" Why do you want to put yourself through that again?"" He says. "" Why are you doing this to our relationship?"", he adds. Like I am the only one that did this.   

I tell him I can't do it. He tells me to choose between him or the kid. I refuse and he leaves. 

I am thinking that I can do this by myself. I have a great job, a house, a savings, a wonderful support system, a 401K, health insurance. I have enough money to raise this kid. It won't be easy, but I can do this. I am ready. My parents have been waiting ages for a grandchild ( I am an only child) are ridiculously happy about this. They throw all of their support behind me and tell me that I don't need anyone else. They say I can do. 

I know I could give this baby a wonderful home. I would love him/her like no one has ever loved a child ever. They would be the most wanted baby in the entire world.

He is refusing to tell him parents or family (even though I know they would be thrilled because they have talked about us having kids with hopeful eyes in the future). He says that he will move to another country just to get away from me, and he feels like I betrayed him.

I understand where he is coming from, but come on. I told him I would never force him to be in the kids life. I would never want that for either of them. I could love them enough for both of us. He says that isn't enough and he would hate me forever if the child was born. He only calls me to discuss the abortion and how much time I have left to get one in our state ( I am 15 weeks now)   

I don't want to hurt the man I love but I can't do this to myself. I can't get an abortion when I know this is my only shot. I just can't. 

Is there anything I can say to him to make this easier for him? Has anyone been in this position?

Notes: I know the risk for me. Although the finance has never discussed it or brought it up. I talked to my doctor. He says the risks are there, especially with my history, but that stranger things have happened. He says he supports my decision and that he would do whatever he could to make sure the pregnancy is successful. He even gave me some information about the risks and facts about my situation. 

Also, I know that in a perfect world he would have a say. I understand, but look at my past. All the hell I went through. I owe it to me to try once more. 

And I understand by doing so that I am walking away from my relationship. 

**tl;dr: Had a bad history with pregnancies and not being able to carry. Got pregnant. Now fiance is unsupportive.  I can support the baby only. I know this will end our relationship. How do I deal emotionally?**

To recap: Questions: 

How do I deal emotionally with a break up during pregnancy?
Is there anything I can say to him to make this easier for him? 
Has anyone been in this position?
Any advice from someone is an older single mother?


Any advice would be appreciated. Kind of new to reddit so please forgive any breaking the rules. They aren't intentional. Thank you!

Edit: Found out I was pregnant 5 weeks ago, not 13 ( mistyped that). Waited until 12 weeks to tell fiance. I am now 15 weeks. 

Edit 2: For the last time, I am not asking anyone here if they thought I made the right decision. I am asking for advice on how to handle the break up. Please read the questions. I have made the choice. It is done. Enough. I am not getting an abortion.   

Edit 3: everyone seems to be adding a lot or filling in a lot of details that actually never happened to justify their stance. Stop that. You weren't there. 

To clarify: he was present at all my bc shots. He saw me get the shots every time I went. I didn't not fail in taking my precautions. I did not get pregnant on purpose.

He knew I wanted kids from the start. I told him, repeatedly.

I never once said he had do anything for me and I have not/ will not force his hand. 

He keeps contacting me to push abortion at me. I never call him.

I waited 5 weeks to tell him because I assumed I would miscarry yet again and wanted to save myself a little grief. Should I have told him sooner? Yes. Why did I wait? See my pregnancy history. 

The kid is here. Well, the pregnancy is here. I am not having an abortion. I already made that decision. He doesn't have to be in his life if he doesn't want to but I don't have to sit around and feel bad about my decision just because he wasn't ready.

Haven't I been through enough already?

I came here for help with a breaking up issue, and I got attacked for my decision and for what people falsely believed I was doing despite my repeatedly assurance that I wasn't forcing him to do anything.

For the people that offered real advice, thank you.  For everyone else, read my post again and really think about shit before you say it. Fuck. I have fucking feelings too. You
Bastards. Thanks a lot. "
