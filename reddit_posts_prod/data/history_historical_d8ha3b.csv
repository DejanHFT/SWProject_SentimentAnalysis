"What are the historical reasons the United States barely grows any tea despite the enormous market for it worldwide and having the right climate in the Southeast, which is essentially the same as Southeast China where lots of tea is grown?",Aronious42,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/d8ha3b/what_are_the_historical_reasons_the_united_states/,244,1660,"I was looking into tea recently after actually starting to drink it for the first time in my life, and was kind of puzzled to why there isn't more tea production in the US. It's the processed drink with the largest production by far worldwide. The US isn't a tea country like Britain or other counties of course, but it could still be shipped worldwide, and there's still a domestic market though not like China's of course. And unless I am misunderstanding something, tea could grow throughout the American Southeast no problem. It has the same climate classification as huge swaths of southern China, humid subtropical. Is the American lack of interest in tea compared to coffee entirely to blame, or are there other hidden historical reasons?"
