Self post to avoid Karma Whoring. I just wanted to put it out there. I love watching Motivational Videos about lifting and training for any sport to get pumped up, pictures or stories. 

However I noticed that they can get a little cluttered in the actual fitness feed... so I made this. 


No Rage or Fuck yeah comics.... Avoid memes of any kind >.< 

Otherwise, have at it! 

EDIT: I'm new to the subreddit thing, sorry for not posting anything before hand!
