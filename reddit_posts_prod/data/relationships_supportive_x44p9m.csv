How can I (F21) be more supportive for my I friend (F21) when she's gushing about her crush (F21)?,mrlnxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/x44p9m/how_can_i_f21_be_more_supportive_for_my_i_friend/,12,10,"I (F21) have been friends with my friend, let's call her Laura (F21) for about 5 years. We're both lesbians, but have never dated and I have never seen her in a romantic or sexual way, so please don't make this about jealousy. Since I've known her she's gone on a lot of Tinder dates, but never seriously dated anyone long term or was actually in love/had a crush.

Now Laura has met this girl (F21), let's call her Jane, on a dating app, they have texted for some weeks and now met twice and are totally smitten with each other. I've never seen Laura so on cloud nine and obsessed with someone. She talks about her a lot and hopes a long term relationship will come out of it, but they are trying to ""take it slow' even though they're already obviously in love with other. They are writing very cheesy messages and telling each other how great they think they are, etc.

I'm not sure why, but I can't be completely happy for her. The messages they write are cringey to me and would've been to Laura as well a few weeks ago. Generally, I don't feel like Laura and Jane are a great match, because when I ask Laura what she likes about Jane she only ever lists superficial qualities or vibes, nothing ""substantial"". I feel like Jane is the opposite of Laura and that they don't share values or interests and it seems like they haven't discussed any of the important things. Also, Jane has made several comments that are red flags to me, some of them even about me. Nothing too bad, just stuff that makes me feel like her vibes are off.

Now, I know it's not my business and Laura can and should date whoever she wants. My question is just how I can be supportive when she is gushing about Jane, even though I don't think they're a fit? Also, since Laura being in love is new to me in general, how does one react to someone talking about how great someone else is? How do I make sure my issues with Jane don't pull down Laura's mood when she talks about Jane with me?

I know my feelings regarding Jane are not valid and it's Laura's business, I'm just asking how to better hide or deal with my negative emotions in order to be a good and supportive friend for Laura.


TL;DR: My friend's new crush has bad vibes imo, and I can't really be happy for her when she's gushing about her. I know that's my problem and I want to work through it to be a better friend."
