"If a piece of modern technology such as a mobile phone were sent back in time to say the 1940's, would it be possible for scientists to reverse engineer much of the technology?",fireball_73,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/104bnl/if_a_piece_of_modern_technology_such_as_a_mobile/,27,62,"This is a premise that appears a lot in sci-fi: a time traveller goes back in time and accidentally loses a device such as a mobile phone. Usually some stereotypical bad guy reverse-engineers the technology and takes over the world. 

My question is: using technology, equipment, and knowledge of science from the 1940's would it be possible to reverse-engineer the technologies such as semi-conductors, microprocessors, LEDs, etc. from a mobile phone?"
