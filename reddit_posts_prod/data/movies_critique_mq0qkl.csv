"""Josie and the Pussycats"" was a flop because it was too smart for the supposed target audience. Now it's a cult classic.",AnonymousFive64,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/mq0qkl/josie_and_the_pussycats_was_a_flop_because_it_was/,110,159,"I think when Josie and the Pussycats came out, people expected it to be a harmless chick flick based on a popular cartoon. What the directors chose to do was a acid-tongue critique on pop culture, making fun of corny boy bands and how the Industry treated pop acts like fast food. 

The film also has three likable leads: Rachael Leigh Cook (should have been a big star), Rosario Dawson (cute) and Tara Reid (surprisingly funny, Reid had a knack for comedy that was sadly wasted). But the scene stealers are Alan Cumming and Parker Posey."
