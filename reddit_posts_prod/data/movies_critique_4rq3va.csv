"How can Wet Hot American Summer be poorly critiqued (32% RT) but then the prequel ""First Day of Camp"" that plays on the same jokes and characters be positively critiques (92% RT)?",osmlol,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4rq3va/how_can_wet_hot_american_summer_be_poorly/,35,26,"This dumbfounds me. The same characters and jokes can, 14 years later, receive a 92% RT score when the original which is arguably much better receives a 32% RT score. 

Are the same people not critiquing the movies since it was only on netflix?"
