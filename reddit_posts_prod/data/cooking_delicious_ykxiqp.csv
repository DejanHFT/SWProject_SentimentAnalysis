I had no idea how easy and delicious homemade pizza is.,zimeyevic23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/ykxiqp/i_had_no_idea_how_easy_and_delicious_homemade/,264,661,"We always wanted make pizza at home but keep postponing it after getting discouraged by recipes online. Pizza stones, high heat, waiting for dough to rise... Turns out we don't need all those to enjoy our pizza. 

Wife said we will just make and see, found a no rise dough recipe online, made a cold pizza sauce, shredded mozzarella and some chorizzo. We were floored by it. It was so good, so fast, tasted exactly like the pizza we order and it costs nothing compared to ordering.

So what i say is, you don't need a pizza stone, fancy open flame pizza oven, a stand mixer for the dough. Don't get discouraged by them like we did and try it.

Edit: Recipe time 

[The dough](https://www.theovenlight.net/2018/03/super-quick-pizza-dough-no-rise-time/#recipe)

Sauce is eyeballing of tomato paste, red pepper paste, thyme, garlic powder and mixing it vigorously.

Oven setting: 280C with top bottom with fan open. Cook time 4 mins.

Edit 2: lovely supporting comments below, i appreciate it. Also, friends saying ""yeah pizza is easy, i make the dough and let it sit for **2 Days** is missing my point by about a mile or 2."
