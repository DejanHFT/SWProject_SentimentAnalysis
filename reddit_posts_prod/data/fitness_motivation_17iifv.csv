How do you stay motivated?,Thorse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/17iifv/how_do_you_stay_motivated/,101,21,"It's winter and I'm having trouble staying motivated. It's cold, there's slush everywhere and it's getting harder and harder to go to the gym after work and eat another plate of chicken and walk up and down those stairs after leg day.


There's barely any sun and it's getting harder and harder to push that extra rep. I feel tired mentally well before I hit that wall. I know my body can do more than it is, but lately I'm getting burned out and having trouble progressing.


What motivates you guys? What helps you through slumps when the iron seemingly mocks you and you start to hear the dreaded ""is all this worth it"" question in your head?"
