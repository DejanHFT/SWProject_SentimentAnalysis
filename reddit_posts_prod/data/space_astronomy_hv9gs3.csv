"I'm Jonathan Davis. I helped measure the angular diameter of Alnilam and Mirzam which was recently published in a Nature Astronomy paper using Stellar Intensity Interferometry(SII), an astronomy technique which was mostly abandoned in the 1970's. AMA!",astronomaestro,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/hv9gs3/im_jonathan_davis_i_helped_measure_the_angular/,31,115,"More specifically Nolan Matthews and I measured the angular size of Alnilam and Mirzam using the [VERITAS](https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu) telescope array located at the Whipple Observatory in Arizona on December 15, 2019. The experiment results presented in the paper were over 10+ years in the making.

The reason why these results are important, is that we used Stellar Intensity Interferometry (SII) to make the measurements presented, a technique that was mostly abandoned by the 1970's. Our results show that with modern technology and massive telescopes, SII is much more useful than it used to be and that it can contribute to astronomy in unique and powerful ways. We hope the results will help re-invigorate the field of SII.

One of the most exciting prospects (at least to me) is that we could use SII with the [Cherenkov Telescope Array](https://www.cta-observatory.org) and could possibly make images of stars which are much akin to the [famous black hole image](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/news/black-hole-image-makes-history), possibly even resolving stellar features like star spots.

I personally created the software ASIIP (pronounced 'a sip' like you are taking a sip of water) which lists which stars are best to measure using SII for any given observatory. I was also helping make additional SII stellar diameter measurements until COVID-19 came around and ruined all the fun we were having.

Fun fact, these measurements take hours to make and it can get pretty boring, so while taking some these measurements, I was browsing memes on Reddit to help keep myself alert while not being too distracted. Lots of things can go wrong when operating the observatory so it is imperative to be alert enough to notice any alarms going off, which means you must stay awake even though you experience some pretty intense 'jet lag' the first few nights. Staying up all night for weeks on end, taking measurements of stars was awesome, but it is also exhausting and not quite as romantic as it may sound.

I will also be entering the Cornell Astronomy and Space Science PhD program this Fall.
