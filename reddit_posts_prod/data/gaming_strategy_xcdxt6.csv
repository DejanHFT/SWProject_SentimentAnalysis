4x strategy games recommendation,SSD_Misanu,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/xcdxt6/4x_strategy_games_recommendation/,23,2,"Hi all,

Whilst I've played turn-based strategy games pretty much my entire life (XCOM, Darkest Dungeon etc) , I'm a total newbie to the 4x genre. I recently tried picking up Civilisation 6 and Endless Space 2, both of which seem like fantastic games but I have some issues.

I like the exploration and expansion aspects of the games, but find the combat absolutely tedious. In strategy games I've played previously such as the aforementioned XCOM genre, combat is well developed and fun. 

My question is, does anyone have any recommendations for a 4x game with fun and interesting combat? Am I looking at the completely wrong genre for this? Have I just not played Civ6 or EndlessSpace2 enough to appreciate it? (about 30-50 hours in each)

Any input is appreciated! Thank you!"
