"You can chicken fry leftover meatloaf slices, and it is delicious!",yblame,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/rmlxf4/you_can_chicken_fry_leftover_meatloaf_slices_and/,87,392,"Last night I made meatloaf and baked potatoes. Pretty standard meal. Today I was faced with this hunk of cold meatloaf, so I sliced it, dunked the slices in flour and then beaten egg, and then into seasoned flour. Fried in oil, they came out crispy and hot and so good. Some butter and garlic angel hair pasta alongside. Easy leftover dinner."
