What upcoming game in 2024 has you the most excited?,willrsauls,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/19b0pvj/what_upcoming_game_in_2024_has_you_the_most/,133,9,"Just as the title says. What game are you looking forward to the most this year? 

For me, it’s probably Metaphor: re Fantazio. Persona 5 is one of my all time favorite games and I’m really interested in seeing that game’s core creative team work on something completely separate from Persona or SMT, even if the gameplay looks pretty similar to those games. Of course, I’m also gonna be playing Persona 3 Reload.

Other games I’m looking forward to off the top of my head are FFVII Rebirth, Earthblade, Like a Dragon 8, and Shantae Risky Revolution

Dragons Dogma 2, Little Nightmares 3, Tekken 8, Stalker 2, and Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines 2 are all games that are super cool, but I’m not familiar with the series. Super cool for the fans of those series and I hope they turn out good. I’ll probably check a few of them out as well (I have my eye on Dragon’s Dogma 2).

I also want to say I’m excited for Stellar Blade and Silent Hill 2’s remake, but we don’t know if either are coming this year and there’s honestly no telling how they’ll turn out. Stellar Blade’s studio seems to be extremely new with not a lot under its name and Silent Hill 2 is a massively high bar for a fairly divisive studio, let alone considering Konami. 

Also Paper Mario TTYD Remake, but I’ve already played that game on Gamecube. Super cool it’s happening though even if it’ll probably wait to pick it up. I still haven’t gotten Metroid Prime’s remaster for the same reason.

What game(s) are you excited for?

Edit: I wanted to add Silksong and Elden Ring DLC, but we don’t know for sure if those are happening this year yet."
