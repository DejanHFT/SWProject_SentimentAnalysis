"If you are a follower of literary essays (and think pieces), how do you keep yourself ""up to date""?",palsdrama,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18xutb5/if_you_are_a_follower_of_literary_essays_and/,14,29,"I know it is not especially book related, but I think it still makes sense to post this here. I've recently been introduced to the ""Best American Essays"" series through its 2023 number. I started wondering ""aside from these professional editors, how do people actually find these essays? how am I supposed to know, apart from waiting for this end-of-the-year collection?"". That is basically what i'm asking. If you like to read literary essays and think pieces/cultural criticism, how do you know where to start? Do you know of a good newsletter than recommends good essays?

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who has commented! You have all been very kind and helpful! I was familiar with Paris Review and other literary journals. There are a few issues of them at the second-hand bookstore I work at. It's a shame subscriptions are SO expensive. Some of you suggested some fantastic alternatives."
