Using metric units for astronomy,oscarboom,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/p8eo2l/using_metric_units_for_astronomy/,10,8,"I have been maintaining this chart of metric values for use in understanding the large distances of outer space.   Metric is perfect for providing an easy understanding of both absolute and relative distances in astronomy because it provides distance units for every needed scale and an easy way to go up and down the scale.

The most important part of ""thinking in metric"", as I call it, is to learn the metric SI prefixes along with their matching powers of 10 (all divisible by 3) from section 1. So it is important to know and use not just kilometers but all of the metric SI distance units for kilometers and higher.   It is much easier to remember that an Astronomical Unit is 150 gigameters than 1.5 x 10^8 kilometers or 1.5 x 10^11 meters.  You probably already know about ""mega"", ""giga"", and ""tera"" if you understand computers.  Section 2 has the conversion values from metric units into common units like light years, parsecs, and astronomical units.  And section 3 is helpful in developing an intuitive feel for how large the various metric distance units are.  

How long are the metric units for large distances?  A megameter is nearly the distance from NYC to Chicago.  A gigameter is about 2.5x the distance to the moon.  A terameter is about 2/3 of the distance from the Sun to Saturn and light travels at 1.08 terameters per hour.  A petameter will get you into the near side of the Oort Cloud.   An exameter is 25x the distance to Alpha Centauri and 1/19 the thickness of the galactic disk.  A zetameter is the diameter of our entire galaxy.  And a yottameter is the diameter of the Virgo Supercluster which includes our galaxy.  

So kilometers and megameters are useful scales for orbits around planets and lunar distances.  Gigameters and terameters are useful scales for planet and solar system object distances.  Petameters are useful for interstellar distances.  Exameters are useful for larger galaxy structures and very distant stars.  Zettameters is a useful scale for understanding distances between galaxies.  And yottameters is a useful scale for galactic superclusters and larger structures.
 

__I. Metric distance units__ 
  
- kilometer (km) = 1m x 10^3  (one thousand meters)
- megameter (Mm) = 1m x 10^6   (one million meters)
- gigameter (Gm) = 1m x 10^9   (one billion meters)
- terameter (Tm) = 1m x 10^12   (one trillion meters)
- petameter (Pm) = 1m x 10^15  (one quadrillion meters)
- exameter (Em) = 1m x 10^18  (one quintillion meters)
- zettameter (Zm) = 1m x 10^21  (one sextillion meters)
- yottameter (Ym) = 1m x 10^24  (one septillion meters)
  
  
__II. Conversions to non metric units__  
  
- 1 Megaparsec (Mpc)         = 30.86 (~31) zettameters
- 1 __Parsec__ (pc)          	= 30.86 (~31) petameters  
- 1 __Light Year__ (ly)    	        = 9.46 (~9.5) petameters  
- 1 Light Day                    = 26 terameters
- 1 Light Hour                    = 1.08 terameters
- 1 __Astronomical Unit__ (au)   = 150 gigameters  
- 1 Light Minute                  = 18 gigameters
- 1 Light Second 		 = 300 megameters  
- 1 Mile			         = 1.6 kilometers  
- 1 Yard                          = 0.915 meters
