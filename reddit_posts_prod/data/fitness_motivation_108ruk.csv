This subreddit is so motivating.,Renix,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/108ruk/this_subreddit_is_so_motivating/,69,308,"I know it's been said many times before, but I wanted to say it myself.

I spend a... fair bit of time on Reddit, and whenever I come to this sub it always gets me off my ass and to the gym, especially on the days that I really don't want to. Seeing so many other people get excited about fitness gets me excited too. The worst is when I'm late night redditing and get the gym bug but can't go because it's 3 am haha.

So thanks everyone! Keep on keeping on."
