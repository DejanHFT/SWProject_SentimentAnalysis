The Melancholy of the Double Speed Slow Down,tomhagen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/16rirha/the_melancholy_of_the_double_speed_slow_down/,2,6,"Two incredibly wonderful videos implore the same technique:

The Police - Wrapped Around Your Finger

Coldplay - Yellow

Here's how they achieved the effect on ""Yellow,"" which is smilier to how the Police video was shot.

> The video was directed by British directing duo James Frost & Alex Smith of The Artists Company. It was shot at 50 frames per second, twice the regular speed. At the shoot, Chris Martin had to sing the song at double speed so that the audio and visual content would be in sync, a common yet difficult practice of music videos. The final product is slowed to 25 frames per second, giving the slow-motion effect of the video. The transition of the video from night to day was achieved during the telecine process. During the transfer from film to videotape, an operator manually adjusted from a monochromatic, grainy look at the start, to a warm, colourful and bright look at the end of the video. The look was inspired by the night swimming scenes in the movie Jaws."
