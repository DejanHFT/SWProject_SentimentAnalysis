Looking for a cheap country with lots of hiking/swimming/adventure opportunities,Objective-Tea-3070,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/uwafmt/looking_for_a_cheap_country_with_lots_of/,11,0,"&#x200B;

**TLDR: I'm planning a budget trip. I love swimming/hiking/adventure, so I got as far as considering Asia and South America as my top two continents. Now I have to decide which country within those is the best.** 

Hi! Sorry if this question comes up a lot, but I like direct answers rather than sifting through Google. Here's the rundown about me and my travel goals: I have a $3000 salary for my summer job. My mom and I are friends and like hanging out with each other, so she offered to go with me somewhere next year.  We would each pay for our own flight tickets/food. We haven't hammered out the rest of the details yet, but we decided that from the start.  I started researching last week, and it's so exciting!

Here's what I've decided for destination criteria so far:

* Cheap (I'm thinking South America or Asia)  because you can get a lot of adventure for less.
* Beaches/coral reefs AND mountain hikes: I love both so much, I could never choose!
* Good transportation so that I could get to said beaches/hikes
* A country with a colorful culture and history would be cool too. I'm a writer and I think being in a lively, unique culture would inspire me.

I feel like Europe is easiest logistically, so are there any European countries I could consider?"
