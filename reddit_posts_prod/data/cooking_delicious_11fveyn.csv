How to cook delicious food when most supermarket ingredients are poor in taste?,Maleficent-Number-10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/11fveyn/how_to_cook_delicious_food_when_most_supermarket/,24,0,"I love delicious healthy food, food that goes beyond just relying on more cheese or mayo. 

Yet, most supermarket produce and ingredients aren’t delicious to start with, especially now in winter. 

The farmer market can be great in summer, but what to do in winter? 

Also, my farmer market could easily bankrupt Elon Musk which doesn’t make it reasonable to buy a lot and often sadly. Leaving me with typical supermarket items as a convent, practical and affordable option.

Edit: to clarify for future commenters. 

Fresh tomatoes from a garden vs supermarket tomatoes. 

There is a clearly taste difference. Tomatoes in my country just taste like water most the time sadly."
