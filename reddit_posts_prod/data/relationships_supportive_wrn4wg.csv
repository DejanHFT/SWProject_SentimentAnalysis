How do I [35 M] be more supportive of my new partner [27/F] who is still grieving the loss (death) of her ex-bf?,idungraduatedsuckah,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wrn4wg/how_do_i_35_m_be_more_supportive_of_my_new/,25,39,"I met and have been dating my current gf for about a month now.  Her bf of 6 years committed suicide a little over a year and a half ago (she actually found him when she came home), and after a pretty self-destructive and downward spiraling phase (from what she's told me) she's ready to try and be with someone again.  She is currently going to therapy on a somewhat regular basis to try and work through the mountain of issues that have arisen since then and she has opened up to me about the incident and subsequent downward spiral.


I know that the grieving process takes time, years most likely, as I personally cannot even fathom the loss nor the shock of losing someone in that sudden and horrific a manner.


I know (and am obviously ok) with the fact that she is still in love with him and will probably always be in love with him, and has keepsakes of him in her life.  I can't fault her for that at all.  She's cried a couple of times while spending time together and poured out more about that trauma and I've tried to be as comforting as possible.   She had a downward spiral of drugs and flings over the course of the year to try and deal with the pain but said she's ready to try and see if she can be with someone again.


Now from a purely detached perspective, we are absolutely wonderful together, we share so many interests, ideals, and have an amazing time together.  She's super attentive and calls me first every morning and does all the things you'd expect from a doting partner that's into you.


I do have a little insecurity though... eg. is she just using me as a crutch or another tool to heal and once she's better she may decide that a relationship with me isn't what she needs or that she's not ready for one?  That does have me worried more than a little, especially if I'm emotionally investing alot of myself with her only for a rugpull to occur.
