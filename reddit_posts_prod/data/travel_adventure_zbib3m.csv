What do you do in your hometown to bring some of that adventure and magic of travel into your everyday life?,1tracklover-2waylane,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zbib3m/what_do_you_do_in_your_hometown_to_bring_some_of/,56,48,"Hey there, fellow travellers. Hope you are all well. 

I took a week-long interstate trip for the first time in over four years. It was delightful and much needed, and it has really energised me. I've missed travelling and the sense of adventure that comes with it tremendously. I can't wait to travel again, especially overseas at a ski field. 

I feel like it must be possible to get that sense of adventure in the town you live in and I would love to hear about your experience. 

What did you do in your hometown to bring some of the adventure and magic of travel into your everyday life?"
