What next after you’ve achieved your goals?,jake1er,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8aztiy/what_next_after_youve_achieved_your_goals/,71,52,"I have really enjoyed going to the gym for the past three years but now that I have more or less achieved what I was after it just hasn’t been as fun. Right now I feel like I’m into too many activities and the gym has become what I look forward to the least.    
  
I have a $900 gym membership renewal coming up and I’m thinking of not renewing it and using a combination of a body weight exercises, pull up bar, yoga, bouldering, biking, sports and running to maintain. Has anyone had success moving away from the gym while still maintaining your physique?
