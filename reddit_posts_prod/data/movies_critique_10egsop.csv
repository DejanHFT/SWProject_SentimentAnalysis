Watching it as a teen it was an easy 10/10 for me, as it was a deep and dark commentary on capitalism, with crude controversial humor, blood, sex and a mind-bending ending.

I know that many won't agree with me on Fight Club, but I am sure many of you have had similar experiences rewatching some of you teenage classics. So....
