I [27F] would like my partner [30M] to be more emotionally supportive.,throwaway92837461,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8sl086/i_27f_would_like_my_partner_30m_to_be_more/,20,20,"**tl;dr What are some ways I can ask my partner to be more emotionally supportive? (As opposed to saying ""Everything will be fine."")** 

I'm hoping others have been through a similar experience and have some advice!

My partner and I have been together for a little over a year. I know he expresses love through action: he's always fixing or improving things for me. He cooks, he cleans, he'll happily buy or bring me anything I need when I'm not feeling well. I know he loves me.

The past few weeks have been really hard on me. I suffered a miscarriage (I don't know that I would have kept the baby but it has still been physically and emotionally exhausting) and a week ago I had an IUD inserted. I feel relieved to have even more effective birth control but I've also suffered a lot of side effects (cramping, bleeding, nausea). We're scheduled to go on a trip in a few days and I'm extremely stressed about it. I haven't talked to anyone besides him about the miscarriage. I feel like I have to keep everything together despite being a hormonal mess. I feel like I'll never stop bleeding. I'm afraid to leave the security of my home, my bed, and my heatpad (lol).

When I try to express any fears or feelings, he'll just tell me ""everything will be fine,"" or ""lots of women go through this."" This morning I couldn't stop crying and he tried to make me feel better by cracking jokes. And then finally he just said, ""It's all going to be ok,"" again.

I know I'm extremely sensitive right now but when he says those things it makes me feel stupid for having emotions, because everything will be fine and what I'm going through is not unique. But I also don't know what I'd rather have him do. I know if I asked him to show support in a different way, he would. I guess I'm looking for advice on how to communicate that I need a different response for him and some help in figuring out what that response might be."
