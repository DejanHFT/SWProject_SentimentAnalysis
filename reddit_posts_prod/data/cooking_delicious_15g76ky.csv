Delicious meals for high blood pressure… give me your recipes!,Formal_Coyote_5004,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/15g76ky/delicious_meals_for_high_blood_pressure_give_me/,118,72,"My partners blood pressure is pretty high. It worries me a lot because his grandpa died from a heart attack when he was only 44 and we’re re only 10 years away from that. He also can’t renew his CDL unless his blood pressure is lower than it is now. It runs in his family. his mom is a super active person… lifelong vegetarian and a clean eater and she has high blood pressure too. I have no problem changing our diet but I guess we do eat a lot of cheese (lol we’re both from Vermont… we love some good cheese)

Im very used to salting food because that makes everything better, but I want to make things that are more spice forward. We have pretty limited resources in such a rural place…for example, I have a whole cookbook on curry and it’s hard to find the ingredients I need

He’s not a picky eater, but he doesn’t really like seafood because he cleaned out too many fish guts when he was a kid, so unfortunately he has a bad connection with that. I wish I could cook him some salmon lol I love salmon.

Anyways, any tasty meals for people with high blood pressure would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: to add, we both love chicken. We never get sick of chicken. The only other things he doesn’t like are mushrooms and tomatoes. But that’s pretty much it in terms of limitation"
