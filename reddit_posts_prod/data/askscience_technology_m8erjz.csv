"AskScience AMA Series: I'm Athena Aktipis, professor and author of The Cheating Cell: How Evolution Helps Us Understand and Treat Cancer, ask me anything!",AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/m8erjz/askscience_ama_series_im_athena_aktipis_professor/,126,2013,"Hi, I'm Athena Aktipis, author of [The Cheating Cell](https://www.amazon.com/Cheating-Cell-Evolution-Understand-Cancer/dp/0691163847), a book about cancer as a breakdown of multicellular cooperation. If you would like a quick read, I summarize the main points in this [Slate article](https://slate.com/technology/2017/04/cancer-has-been-with-us-since-the-origins-of-multicellularity.html). I'm a professor of Psychology at ASU where I direct the Interdisciplinary Cooperation Initiative and co-lead the Arizona Cancer Evolution Center. I am also a podcaster and livestream show producer. Ask me anything!


I'll be here to answer your questions around 2:30 PM MDT (4:30 PM ET, 20:30 UT), ask me anything!
