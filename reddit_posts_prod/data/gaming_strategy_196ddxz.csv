Strategy game suggestions (for low end PC),PaschalisG16,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/196ddxz/strategy_game_suggestions_for_low_end_pc/,41,0,"

I love exploring history, especially 18th - 19th century Europe, medieval Europe, and ancient Europe. The thing is my favourite games are open world RPGs. When it comes to strategy games I'm a huge noob though. 

So what are the greatest strategy games of all time I should play? I would like something that's at least 10 years old, as I currently don't have an Xbox (RIP) and I play on a low end laptop. 


I DON'T need impressive graphics and landscapes, just decent gameplay and interesting mechanics."
