What song best exemplifies the state of 'melancholy'?,SergayBoobtitsky,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/3u5i52/what_song_best_exemplifies_the_state_of_melancholy/,7,2,"Melancholy: a feeling of pensive sadness, typically with no obvious cause

My vote goes to 'Skinny Love' by Bon Iver, or 'Solsbury Hill' by Peter Gabriel."
