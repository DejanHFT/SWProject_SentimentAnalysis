Everyone's entitled to their opinion but I honestly hate most literary discourse online,bitchdantkillmyvibe,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wow6f0/everyones_entitled_to_their_opinion_but_i/,929,4202,"I dunno what it is about people who read books but for whatever reason the reviews and discussion that happens among most readers, especially online and *especially* on GoodReads, usually ends up being some of the most pretentious, sanctimonious and self-righteous bullshit ever. I get all mediums have these types in their communities - there's always plenty of people shitting on superhero movies and saying TV peaked with The Sopranos but goddamn, the literary community acts like such a bunch of aggressive gatekeepers it's no wonder people can't be fucked reading anymore. 

The community is one in which you will be unceremoniously shat on if you liked a book that was a bestseller but didn't happen to build upon the already established literary canon or some other wanky shit. Look, I get it, you didn't like the book. That's fine. Everyone has their opinion. But why is it that when someone doesn't like a book, it's talked about like one of the worst crimes committed against man while also outright insulting anyone who may have happened to enjoy it? Most of the people posting these reviews are usually more than happy to critique someone who has dedicated their entire being to the art of writing yet their own review is probably the greatest testament to their own 'art'. I also get the irony of writing a post to complain about people complaining about a book online - let's move past it. 

Like, look at the most liked review of 'The Road' on GoodReads atm. I have to assume that it's satire because it's certifiably insane. It talks about the book like it's an affront to man, while also equating everyone that liked it with a privileged white male or female that is vicariously experiencing trauma and heartbreak through the text that apparently they'll never know of. Like what? The review itself is literally a goddamn thesis, the energy and effort put into expressing such disdain for the book - that at the very least you can surely admit someone put a *painstaking* amount of time into - is just weird and kinda gross. To then go off onto some diatribe about post-modern society and all it's follies - what is wrong with you man? Are you okay? Who hurt you? Like I said, like a book or not, whatever, of course feel free to express your opinion but surely we don't need a 3,000 word review. This isn't a dissertation, you're not in college, chill the fuck out. Tell me a few things you didn't like, a few things you did, then give your arbitrary rating and move on. I dunno, it's just weird, I read patches of the review then scrolled for what felt like an eternity until I saw this sophomoric *dribble* had over 1,500 likes! Am I alone here?

Edit: I should say that I think I just more so have a problem with this specific review, and it kinda reminded me of similar, albeit less shitty reviews. You should really go read it before commenting. Like I said, discourse and discussion is one thing, [this](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6288.The_Road) is another level, lol."
