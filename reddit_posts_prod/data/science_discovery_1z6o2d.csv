"Science AMA Series: I'm Derek Lowe, medicinal chemist and author of ""In the Pipeline"". Ask me anything about drug discovery, chemicals no one should work with, and more.",dblowe,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1z6o2d/science_ama_series_im_derek_lowe_medicinal/,427,691,"The AMA starts at 2 PM EST - thanks for the questions!

Update: 4 PM EST: I'll be offline for an hour or so, but I'll be glad to answer more questions that show up between now and then. I'll be around this evening as well, on and off. Thanks!

Update: 8 PM EST: If anyone's still in the mood to talk drug discovery, I'll be checking in from time to time tonight and over the weekend.

Update, Monday March 3: This post is still up at the top of r/Science, so I'm still willing to field questions. I'll look in once in a while and catch up on whatever appears. Thanks to everyone who's participated so far!"
