"Which historical person, in your own opinion, had the most atypical life, like out of a legend or story?",bema_adytum,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5rsqqn/which_historical_person_in_your_own_opinion_had/,1627,4437,"I would say it was Joan of Arc. Leaving home around 17 from guidance by, to her mind at least, angels, a voice, to rally France and it's Dauphin. Rumors and sayings arose before her about a maiden coming to save France, painfully obvious foreshadowing if put in a book, but wouldn't that have made it inevitable that someone might show up to fit the bill? Anyway, her life is one of the most attested and studied during her time due to her trial and her prosecutors gathering any evidence to undo her. Her heroic conviction in her mission ending in martyrdom, it was unlike anything of the time, especially as a young woman of the time, I think. I do not doubt that she may not have been charged with commanding troops in much, if any, degree but she came at a time dear to her nation and I do not think it can be ever replicated in the same degree today.

Plus, there's a great movie about her trial, a personal favorite, *The Passion of Joan of Arc*.

What other unusual figures have graced our history in such unique ways?"
