What is the last film you saw more than once at the cinema?,Vantage_1011,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/182ni4o/what_is_the_last_film_you_saw_more_than_once_at/,2239,786,"Growing up in the Eighties I used to see a lot of films more than once. In fact, when you bought a ticket for the 1st showing of the afternoon at my local cinema you were allowed to stay in your seat for the next showing as long as that showing wasn't fully booked out. So friends and I ended up watching many films like Raiders, Return of the Jedi, E.T., and Gremlins, multiple times with Return being the one I've probably seen the most with a total of six. Now in my good ol' age, repeat viewings are a rarerity. But in 2017 Blade Runner 2049 was released. I remember thinking at the time, 'Well if it's half as good as the original I'll be happy.' Turns out I actually thought it was better than the original. 

I was in awe of the visuals and score, of course, but what struck me the most was that even though I didn't entirely understand all the threads in the film I felt I entirely understood it through feelings and emotion. It conveyed to me deeply how we are all on this journey to understand what it is to be human. It confirmed in me that the question of what is Human is a fascinating journey to our holy grail. So I asked anyone who was interested in the film to go watch it with me. I ended up seeing it 5 times at the cinema. I'm very certain that this is unlikely to happen again in my lifetime but you never know. So what was the last film you saw multiple times at the cinema and what was it that made you return?
