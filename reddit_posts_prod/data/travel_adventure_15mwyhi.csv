I just got back from the vacation of a lifetime (in Iceland)… Now what???,Griffs_mom,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15mwyhi/i_just_got_back_from_the_vacation_of_a_lifetime/,684,998,"My husband and I just got back from an amazing trip to Iceland. I feel like Iceland was the perfect type of vacation for us and I’m wondering if anyone can recommend another destination where we can travel and experience the country in a similar manner. Here are some of the things we loved about our trip:

-We were able to go at our own pace. We created our own itinerary and drove ourselves around the island on our own.

-It was adventurous enough for two neurotic people, but we never felt unsafe in anything we did.

-Almost everything we did and experienced was outdoors.

-We were able to stay pretty active the whole vacation. 

We like to:
-hike
-eat
-explore
-drive

Any similar vacation destinations that can be recommended is appreciated.

***Edit to add- thank you everyone for all of the incredible ideas. I love that the same places kept popping up.  For me planning vacations is half the fun. It took us 5 years to get to Iceland, so I have plenty of time to plan for our next adventure."
