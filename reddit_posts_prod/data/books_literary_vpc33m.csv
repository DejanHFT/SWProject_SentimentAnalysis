Sources to learn about literary theory and literary criticism through the years?,samiam130,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vpc33m/sources_to_learn_about_literary_theory_and/,14,24,"Basically the title.

I'm more interested in something like a timeline or a compilation of the different theories that can introduce the main ones, from which I can then find the authors and texts relevant to each of them, NOT individual specific books and articles about specific theories (that will come later). Courses, articles, wikis, anything like that would be the ideal.

For example, recommending The Death of the Author wouldn't be a good answer here because that text only mentions like, two schools of thought, and is therefore too specific. A good example would be an online course, website or series of articles introducing multiple schools of thought with a bibliography for further reading."
