How to create a workflow for generating creative output?,Proper_Lawfulness382,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/o18zzp/how_to_create_a_workflow_for_generating_creative/,1,2,"I am a student starting my masters in physics. I have mainly been doing reading and understanding stuff till now, creative output has been there, but it has been a very small part of my work. Now I am slowly transitioning to working with my supervisor and probing new concepts by myself. So I am moving from receiving to creating. From what I understand, design and art school teach you how to keep generating creative output and what to prioritise when you measure your productivity. So can you tell me about it? Or at least, point me towards resources from which I can learn it?

For context: I was inspired to do this after hearing a podcast by Robbert Djkgraaf ([https://spoti.fi/3zyyNdG](https://spoti.fi/3zyyNdG), relevant section starts from 10:40). I will eventually understand how physicists do their research over time, but I feel it would be much better if I can understand it from the design/art side."
