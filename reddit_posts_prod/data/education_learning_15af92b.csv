Which material would allow for a more realistic/useful structural engineering learning experience? Spaghetti bridge or balsa wood bridge?,doroshmoro,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/15af92b/which_material_would_allow_for_a_more/,14,9,"Hi everyone, hoping for some people with engineering backgrounds to help me out here!

 I'm starting a new Engineering Design course for high schoolers this year - it will give students a taste of each major engineering discipline. Although the course will be largely project-based, I do want them to learn key engineering concepts, practices, terminology, etc. I have a background in physics not engineering, so I am definitely seeking out thoughts and suggestions from actual engineers. Since my first unit covers structural engineering and load analysis, I'd like the kids to do the class bridge challenge - design and build a bridge that can withstand a certain amount of weight (I'm thinking of simulating this by driving weighted cars over it). Here's my question: Recognizing that neither spaghetti nor balsa wood recreate a realistic scenario, which material would allow for a better application/discussion/analysis of the concepts that we cover?  
Thanks in advance!"
