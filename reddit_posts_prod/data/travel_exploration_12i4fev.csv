Help me decide between exploring Tuscany or Positano!,purebredcorndog,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/12i4fev/help_me_decide_between_exploring_tuscany_or/,14,1,"I (26m) know that the Tuscany and Amalfi regions offer up their own unique experiences but I was wondering which one of these regions y’all would recommend for a first time traveler to Italy. Me and my partner (23f) will be going to Venice and Rome for sure. It’s going to be a 11 or 12 day trip, so I am having a hard time deciding on the third city. I figured I would give us 3 nights in Venice, 4 nights in Rome, and I was trying to fill in the remaining gap. Me and my girlfriend are very open minded and have no bias towards either location so we would love to hear some advice, stories, pros and cons, whatever it is y’all would like to share with us about both of these locations!"
