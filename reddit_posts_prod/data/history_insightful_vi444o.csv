"During the Spanish Civil War, did Soviet Russia suppress revolutionary Communism in Spain and France to support it’s international alliances and global strategic position?",spalding-blue,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/vi444o/during_the_spanish_civil_war_did_soviet_russia/,143,1023,"Reading George Orwell’s Homage to Catalonia, he says that due of it’s strategic alliance with France, Russia suppressed true Communist revolution  among Republican factions (and in France) in favor of social democracy against the Fascist Nationals. Is this true?

And secondarily, is it another good example of a countries core belief system being unaligned and even compromised by it’s international policy."
