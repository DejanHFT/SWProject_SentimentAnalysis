Try a little hack I use that works especially well for push-ups.,DPedia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/el2ba/try_a_little_hack_i_use_that_works_especially/,39,39,"Inspired by the 100 push-up program post, I thought I might share a trick I use.  
  
A few years ago, before I started going to the gym, all I did was push-ups and sit-ups like a noob. In that time, I didn't progress very much, but I got pretty good a long sets of push-ups.  
  
The trick: **Do 2 push-ups for every 1 count.** For example: Down, up, down, up, **1**. Down, up, down, up, **2**.  
  
You trick yourself into doing a lot more than you would normally do because the number of reps *seems* lower. I always have mental-bock issues doing high-rep exercises, and this helped. Chances are, some of you already do this."
