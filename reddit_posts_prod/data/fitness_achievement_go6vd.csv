"I'm ""skinny fat"", and want to look better. I have two months to spare, and a gym membership. What is the absolute LIMIT of what I can achieve?",skinnyfatwat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/go6vd/im_skinny_fat_and_want_to_look_better_i_have_two/,86,18,"Currently 165lbs and 18% body fat. Male, 20, 5 foot 11 inches. Skinny fat (after losing 135lbs in a year).

Title says it all. In the next two months, I want to transform myself as much as it's possible to transform in two months. I want to push myself to look and feel quite literally as good as I possibly can in that time. 

The main goal is to reduce body fat while retaining as much muscle as I can. I know it's probably impossible to actually gain any muscle, sadly.

What is the absolute limit of what I can expect, and what methods are going to enable me to do this?

**Edit:** my goal does not end in two months, but I start being busy again then, and have two months to absolutely blitz myself. Also I should have mentioned that I want to change myself positively i.e. get fit and muscular, and lose fat. This is opposed to transforming negatively and becoming a fat slob as one commenter suggested!"
