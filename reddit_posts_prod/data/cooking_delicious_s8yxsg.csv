Genuinely delicious low-cholesterol meals?,danielle-in-rags,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/s8yxsg/genuinely_delicious_lowcholesterol_meals/,16,3,"I want to cook for a friend who has been advised to watch their cholesterol, and they find a lot of their options lacking in culinary excitement haha.  
  
So I wanna do them something nice and bring excitement back to their plates -- something that still feels like a treat.  
  
Any ideas?"
