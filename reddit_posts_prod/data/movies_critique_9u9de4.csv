A critique of Nightcrawler,EndlessHalftime,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9u9de4/a_critique_of_nightcrawler/,19,5,"So I just watched Nightcrawler and while I enjoyed it, I feel like it missed a lot of its potential. It was a good movie that could have been great. To me it was very one dimensional. I don’t read this sub often and have never posted before, but when I searched the sub for Nightcrawler it seems like everyone loves the film. It also seems like it comes up often, and there are three discussions about it in the last month. But I feel different about it seems most of you do, so I though I’d join the discussion. So here goes, my critique of Nightcrawler.

There are really three characters of note in the film: Rick, Nina, and Louis. I found myself not really caring about any of them. Rick is a struggling kid trying to make some money however he can, but that’s really all the backstory we get about him. The rest of the movie nothing really happens with him. He wants to get paid more and keeps asking, but there’s really no conflict. Louis just says no until he says yes. At times we get the feeling that he’s afraid of Louis (driving too fast, getting mad at him for spilling gas on the car) but this really doesn’t go anywhere. When he dies at the end, I really didn’t find myself caring. Plenty of people died in the movie and he was just another one. Why not throw in some back story in about how he was on the streets selling drugs and then Louis came along and gave him a chance to straighten his life out? He gets a girlfriend and they’re happy but then he gets shot and killed. It would be cliche, but at least it would be an attempt to make the viewer care about him.

Nina the news editor lady is the second character, and I feel the same way about her as Rick. Clearly they tried to show her as obsessed with the graphic, bloody footage that Louis is filming, but again I think it falls flat. She wants the footage that will get views. Clearly this is a reflection of society as a whole, but it says nothing about her. Her station has the lowest views and she wants to keep her job. But we see nothing that says how far she will go to get the footage, or that she is really obsessed with the footage herself. We could see her overpaying for the footage or caving to Louis’s love interest sooner. Its implied that they kiss and potentially go further when he gets the final footage, but to me it was more about making the station successful where it could have been a passionate moment about their shared love of the gruesome footage.

Louis is the main character, but I’m not sure what we get out of him in an hour and a half. At the start he’s stealing fences and scrap metal to make some money, so we know that he’s not a character with high morals to begin with, and that clearly doesn’t change throughout the film. Like Nina, I feel like there was so much potential for him to get sucked into an obsession of the bloody violence, but I just don’t see it. There are a few moments where he’s uncomfortable with the death he sees, but then he gets desensitized. It would be much more captivating if he became obsessed. We could see him watching back all his footage and having a fascination with it, but we don’t. He gets the footage, gets paid, and moves on. There’s really no motivation besides making money. And even then the money he gets paid for the footage is not much of a point of conflict. They negotiate and move on. The conflict between him and Nina can’t decide if it’s about money or sex or an interest in the footage, and it doesn’t really come off as any very strongly. 

Besides the main character, I felt like there were other characters that we were left not caring about. The dead family were in the drug trade. This doesn’t make their deaths okay, but it does make us care less. They even shyed away from having a dead baby in the crib (or at least implying it). That would have been a really hard hitting, sad moment, but instead the viewer is given relief.

We never even see the faces of the cops killed at the end. The investigator just tells Louis that 4 cops died. They’re just a number added to the tally. This is the one real part where Louis actually causes harm to others (Rick also), but we only ever see the cops from across the street. Give us a 30 second scene of the cops driving along talking about their wives and kids. Makes us care about them and then their deaths would actually feel tragic.

The death of the other stringer just kind of happens out of the blue. Was it trying to say “this is what will happen if you go down this path?” It didn’t feel like it. I think it is trying to show that Louis will film whoever, even if it’s “one of us.” But so what, if he’s willing to film people dieing already what difference does it make?

Both Rick and the lady outside the house with the bullets in the fridge say that they don’t have a TV. I thought this was going to lead to Louis filming footage for the non TV people. The dark, gritty footage that the white suburban TV news viewers can’t handle. But instead it was the opposite. It said that these people aren’t important to TV news, reinforcing Nina’s comments. But then why was the lady outside a suburban home? It makes no sense. Also, Louis could have snuck into a more intimate part of the house or seen something that gives us a look into the family that was attacked. Instead we see a family photo on the fridge and a piece of junk mail. Yeah he shouldn’t have snuck into the house, but we aren’t left to feel like he really crossed the line. Louis never goes so far that the news station can’t air his footage. So it’s not about Louis, it’s about what society wants to see.

At the end of the day, Nightcrawler is a good, entertaining movie with great cinematography. But I felt like it could have been a lot more. The only thing I came away with was that society wants to see blood, violence, and death. It’s what drives all the characters to do what they do. But this could have been shown in a single scene, and instead it was just shown over and over again throughout the film. There could have been so much more depth, but there just wasn’t.

That’s my opinion, feel free to tell me why I’m wrong.
