HELP! I need my creativity back....,keshiirue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/gynyk/help_i_need_my_creativity_back/,10,2,"Well hello Reddit. I am an artist… I am 24 yrs old haven’t really done much “art” in the last year. I have days were I want to draw and I cant. I was just going to see what some of my fellow redditors do to keep that creativity flowing. I just would like to work on something everyday, but it's so hard to motivate myself. I would love to get back to where I was in high school, my senior year in 05 two pieces of my artwork went to state, and now I can’t even pick up a pencil some days…. I would really appreciate some help. Thanks!"
