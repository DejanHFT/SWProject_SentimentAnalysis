Week 6: The virtues and virtue ethics,irontide,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/3hdidw/week_6_the_virtues_and_virtue_ethics/,101,111,"What I will be doing here is two things: giving an introduction of what the virtues are; and then introducing a distinctive field of virtue ethics as the ethical approach which takes the virtues to be the most basic level of moral explanation. The virtues are things like courage, honesty, generosity, and they are opposed to the vices, things like cowardice, dishonesty, and miserliness (everything I say here about the virtues also goes for the vices). The virtues are of enduring interest to everybody because they are the most sophisticated and developed evaluative framework available before you take your first class in moral philosophy. And even moral philosophers make extensive reference to the virtues to explain their theories, even theories that try to replace the virtues as the way we explain the praiseworthiness (or not) of acts—for instance, someone like Peter Singer makes frequent appeals to something being considerate or callous even when explaining the highly revisionist theory of utilitarianism. So, the virtues are a sophisticated and shared framework that it seems we learn how the use as we learn a language and are socialised in a culture.

Philosophers have two different approaches they can take to the virtues-terms as they exist in our everyday moral discourse. Firstly, they can provide a 'virtue theory' where they try to make sense of virtue talk by analysing them in terms of their favoured moral theory. A recent example is the consequentialist Julia Driver who explains virtues as dispositions to behave in ways that are likely to bring about the best consequences. Similarly, a deontologist like Kant (and much of the tradition after him) has a developed virtue theory that tries to explain our use of the virtues with reference to what the basic duties are meant to be. ([Here is an overview of both deontological and consequentialist value theory](http://www.iep.utm.edu/virtue/#H5)) The second approach is to endorse 'virtue ethics': the claim that the virtues are on their own a sufficient and self-contained framework of ethics, not derived from some other framework but instead the basic level of moral explanation. 

**What are the virtues?**

The virtues are complexes of behaviour and responses that are recognisably excellent. We use virtue-terms in two respects: describing individual actions as virtuous, in which case the virtues attach to actions; and describing persons as virtuous, in which case the virtues attach to character traits. These uses are intimately related, but not the same thing. We can describe someone as doing something virtuous without wanting to claim that they have virtuous characters (e.g. a generally untrustworthy person might be praised for holding up their side of a bargain for once) or that someone has a particular virtuous character trait but in this instance failed to do the virtuous thing (e.g. someone may normally be extremely trustworthy but may have let someone down). The same goes for the vices. Note that this is very much like the way we use psychological categories: we can describe someone as normally very open-minded (having the character trait of openness) but in some instance acting in a close-minded manner, and so on.

By calling them ‘complexes’ I mean that there isn’t just one way to display a particular virtue, but instead that there are lots of different kinds of actions that can be courageous or kinds of attitudes that can be honest, where the various examples that fall under the same virtue term are related to each other in an interesting way. To use dispositional terms, the virtues are *multi-track*; to use functional terms, the virtues are *multiply realisable*. By talking about both ‘behaviour and responses’ I want to highlight that the virtues (and many other kinds of actions and character traits) have two components: a behavioural component (moving your limbs in certain ways, affecting the world in certain ways, etc.) and a psychological component (having certain motivations, having sensitivities to certain kinds of features, etc.). So, to do a virtuous thing isn’t just to act in some particular way, but also to have the characteristic motivations or sensitivies or phenomenology that people acting from the virtue does. Both are part of fully-realised virtue. Aristotle makes the distinction between acting according to virtue (having the same behaviour as a virtuous person) and acting from virtue (behaving the way virtuous people do from the reasons that virtuous people have). We can conceive of this difference by way of considering someone playing a good move in chess either because a grandmaster has told them to do so (playing according to good chess sense) or instead because they themselves see why it is a good move and do it under their own self-control (playing from good chess sense). It’s possible to have the psychological reactions but fail to act in the right way, or to act in the right way but not have the same psychology, but fully realised virtue is both. Finally, by calling the virtues ‘recognisably excellent’ is to draw attention to the fact that these are behaviours and responses that are meant to be the type of thing that the agent and their neighbours can recognise as good ones. What the standard is meant to be by which this recognition happens I discuss below.

**How can the virtues be primary?**

The original model of how virtues are the basic building-blocks of morality is provided by Aristotle. The mainstream of the contemporary revival of virtue ethics have been neo-Aristotelean, attempting to develop an updated version of Aristotle’s ethics within the framework of contemporary analytic philosophy. This isn’t the only way people do virtue ethics now but it is the most popular way and the one I discuss here.

Aristotle invites us to take a very big-picture look at human life with reference to what types of action is especially good for beings like us to engage in. So, the scope of evaluation isn’t just one action following another, but also considers how an individual action forms part of a whole life, and one person’s life fits into a that of their community, and how a life in such a community is linked to the kind of creatures the agents are. The way this works is through his use of the ancient Greek notion of *eudaimonia*—the usual translation of this is ‘happiness’ or ‘flourishing’ (the ancient Greek means something like ‘having a blessed spirit’), but I’ll keep the term untranslated because it’s importantly different from the way most people think of happiness these days. The most important difference is that while most people these days thinks of happiness as a mental state that you can flit in or out of moment-to-moment, like a light being flicked on or off, whereas *eudaimonia* is instead meant to be a stable disposition that is an enduring feature of an individual. Think of *eudaimonia* the way you would of trying to change an empty patch of land into a garden: you put in a lot of work to get the soil and plants into a condition where it will continue to produce good plants with the appropriate oversight, you don’t work really hard till you get your first blossom and call it a day. This kind of condition of enduring happiness and contentment is what the ancient Greeks thought was the thing most people wanted from their lives, and Aristotle set out to give an explanation of what it is.

*Eudaimonia* is meant to be a stable disposition of an agent, the kind of thing that the agent is makes a difference to what kind of stable dispositions they can have and is worthwhile for them to have. This is a point Aristotle most famously makes with his *ergon* argument (*ergon* is usually translated ‘function’, though ‘characteristic activity’ may be better—living creatures don’t really have a function, though they characteristically do certain things). He points out how very often we evaluate something with reference to the type of thing it usually does: we care about a knife’s ability to cut things, and a flute-player’s ability to make expressive music, though not vice versa. He then makes the proposal that we can see human’s characteristic activity as pursuing *eudaimonia* rationally (that is, by way of making plans, pursuing projects, deciding on things to do, etc.). Furthermore, the things we are rational about are the things that bring about the kind of things that are the most worthwhile for the kind of beings we are. So, on the Aristotelean account, there are some distinctively human ends that we pursue (just as cutting things is an end for a knife, and musical expression of the flute-player). Whatever else we may be and ends we may have, all of us are also humans and also have the human ends: only some of us are gardeners and have the ends of cultivating soil and plants, but all of us have the end of pursuing *eudaimonia*. So, Aristotle's view is that a good life is a life that develops virtue, and virtues are the complexed of behaviour and reaction that characteristically human ends. Explaining the goodness of someone's actions and character in terms of their contribution to *eudaimonia* is thus meant to be the most basic moral description.

Our own development is among the distinctively human ends somebody may try to achieve, and there are standards about what count as doing well or not at an end. For instance, humans are endowed with certain social capacities, and one of the distinctive goods for humans is to participate in a well-ordered social life--have good relationships with your friends and family, with your intimates, and so on. To succeed at this means, among other things, cultivating the social capacities in yourself that make these good relationships possible. In short, the virtuous life is the life of activity in accordance with practical reasoning, and that the virtuous life is a happy life (thinking of happiness as *eudaimonia*). The life of practical reasoning is the one where you are best able to do the things that are suited for a being of your type to do, and reach the ends of the activities distinctive of the type of being you are. Reaching the ends of the activities a being like you are going to naturally do is going to be both the appropriate kind of value for you to pursue, and the most reliable source of pleasure. This is why Aristotle claims that being virtuous is the most reliable way for us to live happy and contented lives: that the virtues benefit their possessor. And this is the claim that neo-Aristotelean virtue ethicists have tried to make compelling to in the contemporary world as well.

**Points for discussion**

* Is the most plausible account of the virtues one that has them be primary? Perhaps the best way to understand Aristotle is to see how the virtues can be built onto a theory of what makes human lives genuinely worthwhile. On this reading, once we see what stable disposition is best for people to have, and we have a way of describing that disposition without the virtues, we can then explain the virtues using that theory of well-being. But this would make the virtues derivative. 
* Do the virtues need to be defined in terms of well-being? Christine Swanton makes the point that there are many things we admire in people which don’t seem to make their lives better: perhaps their overarching commitment to an artistic project which keeps them poor and struggling, even though eventually many people come to admire their art.
* An important feature of Aristotle's ethics is that he describes epistemic and political virtues alongside the moral virtues, such that there's no distinct domain of moral virtue, but instead we are meant to have all the virtues (moral or otherwise) all at once. This is in contrast with most contemporary theories that have moral reasons to do things separate from non-moral reasons. Is Aristotle's approach here the better one? If not, why should we divorce the moral reasons from non-moral reasons?
