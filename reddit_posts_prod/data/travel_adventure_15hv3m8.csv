European adventure holiday recommendations,MelancholicMoonMan,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15hv3m8/european_adventure_holiday_recommendations/,7,3,"Hi lads I went to kandersteg in Switzerland a few years ago and it was the best holiday of my life. 
I’m looking to do something similar with my girlfriend maybe somewhere else in Europe a bit cheaper we’re both in our early 20s 

Hi energy Stuff like hiking/mountaineering (the mountain huts and ice climbing and hockenhorn were great in Switzerland), via ferreta, canyoning swimming, paragliding really adventurous outdoor stuff
Doesn’t have to be alps either maybe Scandinavian or Morocco or somewhere

Also where we can do nice chilled out stuff like boat ride/ sunbathe, pool, dining experiences.

If anyone has any previous itineraries I’d love to see them thanks so much! Please message me :)"
