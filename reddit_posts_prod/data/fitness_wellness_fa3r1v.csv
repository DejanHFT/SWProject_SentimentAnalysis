Grip gives out well before core in one-handed farmer's carry,Kevybaby,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/fa3r1v/grip_gives_out_well_before_core_in_onehanded/,12,21,"I'm trying to correct a lateral pelvic tilt (hip hike on right) with this exercise that I just found recently, and it feels really good - like it might actually fix this problem. If only I could do it with a heavy enough weight for long enough to really nail my left QL/obliques. The grip on the right hand holding the dumbbell gives out first, by far. Is there any way to make gripping easier or will it just strengthen with time and then the weak link will become the obliques/QL on the left side and I will be able to exhaust them more? To be honest I don't really care much about the grip strength in comparison to the pelvic tilt, which really has significantly impacted my life for years now. This feels like the exercise that could potentially fix it if not for the grip problem. Side planks I can't seem to do without hurting my shoulder, even when I keep a 90 degree angle at the shoulder and use proper form etc. So anyway to help bypass the grip strength problem? Or will I just need to wait for it to strengthen before I can expect the left QL/obliques to start getting exhausted by the one-handed farmer's walks? Thanks

Edit: I'm an idiot and never knew there were straps you could fasten to the weight as everyone is saying. I thought those were only for wrist support. Thank you and thanks also for downvoting me because I asked a question I didn't know the answer to"
