Activities / Worksheets for learning,1nn0vat3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/piw4ci/activities_worksheets_for_learning/,3,2,"Hi everyone,

I am trying to understand how worksheets / activities (for example - [this one](https://samsfriedchickenanddonuts.com/wp-content/uploads/5th-grade-worksheets-math-andsh-language-arts-curriculum-common-core-standards.jpg)) are used in the learning cycle for any student.

1. How important are they?
2. How are they different from other forms of assessments, say assignments etc? Are they usually graded?
3. Do you use them, if so, how do you create them?
4. How do students benefit from them?
5. Do you prefer students solving these online / offline (the print version)?
6. Are they meant only for lower grades? Or do you see them being useful for grades 8-12 as well.

Thank you"
