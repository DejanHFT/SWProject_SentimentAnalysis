How much inspiration is too much inspiration?,jbrennr,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/qhtquv/how_much_inspiration_is_too_much_inspiration/,5,1,"As the title suggests, **how much inspiration is too much inspiration?**  When considering inspiration, I speak on inspiration taken from other literary works, intentional or unintentional.  I'll give an example with a little background below!

As an example, I use my writing abilities to world-build for a novel setting **(** and a setting I plan to use for, a table-top RPG, Dungeons & Dragons **)**, and there is a race of people known as Harengon in D&D, who are rabbit-folk or bipedal rabbits.  Now, I've renamed this race for my novel setting and adjusted them to the setting with a new identity and culture so I'm not necessarily worried about ""taking too much inspiration"" from Wizards of the Coast.  However, ***unintentionally***, **the rabbit-folk of my novel setting are somewhat similar to the Hobbits we know from J. R. R. Tolkien's works?**  There are differences, mind you, as I did not approach building the rabbit-folk of my setting with the intention of having them similar to Hobbits.

My rabbit-folk live in homes built into the ground, much like how a rabbit has a burrow, and these homes' features were to be round like a rabbit's home would be in nature.  My rabbit-folk live a simple life, they like to socialize and they like to eat, have large families **(** a nod to ""breeding like rabbits"" **)** and they are smaller than humans, averaging around 3 feet tall.  **The similarities make me lack a bit of confidence in their creation**, even though there are noticeable differences **(** matriarchal society, matrilineal **/** matriname, no comical interest in drinking or recreational drugs, no clans, French **&** English-inspired naming conventions, etc. **)**.

**What are your thoughts when it comes to taking inspiration?**  When is an inspiration too much inspiration?"
