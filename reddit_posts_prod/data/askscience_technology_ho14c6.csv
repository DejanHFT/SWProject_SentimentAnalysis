"AskScience AMA Series: Are there really aliens out there? I am Seth Shostak, senior astronomer and Institute Fellow at the SETI Institute, and I am looking. AMA!",AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ho14c6/askscience_ama_series_are_there_really_aliens_out/,1121,5093,"I frequently run afoul of others who believe that visitors from deep space are buzzing the countryside and occasionally hauling innocent burghers out of their bedrooms for unapproved experiments. I doubt this is happening.

I have written 600 popular articles on astronomy, film, technology and other enervating topics. I have also assaulted the public with three, inoffensive trade books on the efforts by scientists to prove that we're not alone in the universe. With a Boulder-based co-author, I have written a textbook that I claim, with little evidence, has had a modestly positive effect on college students. I also host a weekly, one-hour radio show entitled Big Picture Science.

My background encompasses such diverse activities as film making, railroading and computer animation. A frequent lecturer and sound bite pundit on television and radio, I can occasionally be heard lamenting the fact that, according to my own estimate, I was born two generations too early to benefit from the cure for death. I am the inventor of the electric banana, which I think has a peel but has had little positive effect on my lifestyle -- or that of others.
