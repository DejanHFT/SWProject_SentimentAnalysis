"""I am certain I will always be unsure."" How do you choose what you believe?",Nebula15,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/z0sam/i_am_certain_i_will_always_be_unsure_how_do_you/,173,142,"I was trying to explain to my girlfriend the other day how my brain operates and why I can never truly ""believe"" without a shadow of a doubt anything unless I experience it myself. I contemplate theories and philosophies all the time and every time I come to a conclusive thought, my brain always takes it another step further. I eventually follow these thought processes to their very core and always come to the same conclusion: Nothing really matters because it is all insignificant. But this is difficult for me to accept because I want to believe in something. 

Let me give you an example: Since I was a kid I have always believed in a spiritual realm but recently (within the passed year or 2) my brain will not allow me to believe anything not backed by scientific fact. 

 My girlfriend (an amazing girl with an incredible mind) understood my dilemma and summed it up neatly for me with this phrase: ""I am certain I will always be unsure."" She nailed it.  
 
Am I doomed for eternity to live in this uncertainty? 

So I am asking you reddit, how do choose what you believe? Or is it even a choice?

EDIT: Whoa! Wasn't expecting so much feed back! It's hard going through all these comments but I'm loving all of your writings. Every post I have gone through has been insightful and very eye opening. I got a lot of reading to do now, thanks for all the great articles and books! Anyways, thank you to all and I wish you the best in your quest for understanding."
