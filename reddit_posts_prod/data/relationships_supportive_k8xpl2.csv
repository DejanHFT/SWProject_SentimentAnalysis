My girlfriend has eating issues and I find it hard to be supportive,dirtydirtycrimes,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/k8xpl2/my_girlfriend_has_eating_issues_and_i_find_it/,5,1,"My girlfriend (18F) has issues eating consistently and without guilt. I (18M) am having a hard time getting her to not feel guilty and to encourage her to eat. We’re currently long distance so it’s not like I can make something for her or drive her to a restaurant. I feel useless when she tells me she didn’t eat all day and I can’t do a thing about it. I tell her this and she doesn’t expect me to say anything as it’s an ongoing battle with herself, but i feel like I need to say something. What should I do? 

TL;DR my girlfriend and I are long distance and I can’t get her to eat most days, how can I help her?"
