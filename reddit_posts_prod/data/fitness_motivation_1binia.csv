Losing motivation due to lack of results (pics and routine),windsurf80,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1binia/losing_motivation_due_to_lack_of_results_pics_and/,46,8,"Stats First:

    
    
Age: 33    
Height:  6'    
Weight:  173lbs    
BF:  No sweet clue, lets say 18%    
    
    
        
Routine:  I've been working hard for 3 months or so, never missing a workout and always pushing really hard.  I started with a push/pull/legs split, then moved to a 5x5 variation with higher rep accessory work thrown in for the last 6 weeks.  I've had good progression on the lifts over the last few weeks mainly because I started low.    
        
5rep working weights    
Bench: 90 -> 135    
Squat:  90 -> 200    
Dead:  125 -> 210    
        
Obviously still very weak but just getting started on the more strength based stuff.     
        
Diet:  Trying to slow bulk at the moment.  Eating around 3200 on rest days and 3400 on workout days (3 days a week).  I've been hitting my calories and macros 100% of the time for the past 3 months using myfitnesspal.  My eating has gotten a bit less ""clean"" over the last month though because I struggle to get 3400 calories of chicken, broccoli and oats, so I've started to follow a bit more of an IIFYM style diet.  Mostly whole grain breads, meat, subway subs, tons of yoghurt, milk, almonds.        
        
**My issues**            
        
First off I feel like aside from small weight increases on the strength side, my physique is still gross and not making progress.  I made the mistake of not taking before shots so its hard to tell.  The only thing I know for sure is my arms have grown at least an inch, because before working out I could wrap my middle finger and thumb around the narrow part of my upper bicep and have them touch, but now I can only make it about half way.  Aside from that and my left pec growing nothing seems to have changed.  My right pec for some reason is lagging hugely behind the left.        
The other issue is in the morning I feel like a twig, then in the evening I feel like a bloated pig.  I know this is digestion related but is it normal for the swing to be that drastic? 
        
**My main questions for fittit are:**         
    
**a)** I was 168 on Jan 1, now 173.  Should I up my calorie intake and bulk a bit faster or at my age is it safer to keep it really slow to avoid fat?        
        
**b)** Is progress supposed to be this gradual?  My gut says yes and I have no problem working out for the rest of my life, I just lose motivation when I see some of the other progress pics here and on bb.com.  I started in Jan and was hoping that by the time July hit it might actually look like I kinda work out when I have my shirt off, doesn't look like that goal will be reached.            
**c)** Should I do anything to try and correct my pec imbalance or as such a total newbie should I just keep at the compounds and hope it resolves itself?
