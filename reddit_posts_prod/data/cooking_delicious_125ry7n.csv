"Does anyone have a canned foods ""dump and stir"" recipe that actually tastes delicious and turns out great?",Pleasant_Choice_6130,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/125ry7n/does_anyone_have_a_canned_foods_dump_and_stir/,361,250,"We have to eat dinner with my in-laws tonight and my boo's Mom, I hate to say it, bless her, is a terrible cook. 

She tends to use canned vegetables exclusively (those little white potato slices, the grey green beans, the tinny tomatoes and okra...) and lots of artificial ingredients (really cheap margarine, baco's, processed cheese, always with diet sodas or bottles of fake iced tea on the side).

Tonight she's serving ""Shepard's Pie,"" which will be cans of Chunky soup and diced tomatoes mixed with the cheapest beef cuts possible topped with Instant Mash. 

Yay. 

I know canned corn is actually pretty good and sometimes so are canned black-eyed peas. 

Not preferred, but not totally awful. 

It seems like I've seen some successful succotash-type canned corn dishes and ""cowboy caviar"" black eyed peas type things. 

Maybe some bean salads?

Does anyone have any ""sure fire"" open and mix & dump type recipes I maybe could pass along to her that are a little bit more delicious? 

(or at least edible LoL)"
