Interior concrete floor - DIY or hire?,sassages,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/199xvar/interior_concrete_floor_diy_or_hire/,0,1,"This interior stained concrete floor is peeling and scratches like crazy from pets. I have a couple questions about it. I'm a semi-confident DIY'er, but I'm not certain that I should be the one to mechanically or chemically strip the floor so that it may be polished or re-sealed. It's about 300+ sq/ft of surface.

1.) Is this a project an amateur should attempt?  
2.) Is mechanically stripping or chemically stripping advised? I'm looking for the easiest solution that won't mess up the concrete as it is our living room.  
3.) If we went with mechanical stripping, should I begin with a diamond pad on a large floor sander rental from Homedepot or any other store? Do I perform this initial strip ""wet"" to reduce dust? This process makes me nervous. I assume after diamond pad stripping, I'd use a lower grit pad to smooth things out.  
4.) If we went with chemical stripping and scraping, is there any advantage or disadvantage? This method also makes me nervous. There's a lot of wet materials and possibly harsh chemicals involved. There's also a risk of etching I hear?  


Nervousness aside, I usually always achieve my desired goal given proper instructions. I have yet to mess anything up (fingers crossed). I'd love to not pay someone else to do it if it's no big deal.
