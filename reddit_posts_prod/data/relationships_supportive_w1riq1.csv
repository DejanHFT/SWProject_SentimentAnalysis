"My boyfriend (M24) is an alcoholic and keeps relapsing, should I (F22) stay and be supportive of his recovery or move on with my life?",stormingin,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/w1riq1/my_boyfriend_m24_is_an_alcoholic_and_keeps/,10,4,"My boyfriend (M24) and I (F22) have been together for 8 months. We got together a couple months after I left my abusive ex boyfriend. So before getting into a relationship again I set stronger boundaries and higher standards. 

However he’s an alcoholic in recovery that can’t make it more than 2 months sober. I love him when he is sober. I fell in love with the man he is SOBER. Every time he relapsed he drinks for 2 days straight, goes to work intoxicated, tries to get behind the wheel. He’s just very self destructive and messy. He’s just a completely different person. He’ll be doing great, really working his program, going to meetings but then something will trigger him and then he’ll relapse. 

Around the 3rd relapse, I told him that that’s not the relationship I want anymore. If he’s not going to put more effort in his recovery then I can’t be in a relationship with him. 

A month ago he relapsed got a DUI and has been in jail since. I’ve only heard from him twice. 1 was to help him ask is mom with the bail, (which I declined) 2. Was to ask me if he can still call me from jail (which I declined) I’ve maintained no contact so I can just process. 

He has always been respectful, treats me amazing, my family loves him, our values align and never aggressive. And I love him. I miss him so much I don’t know if I should reach out to him just to hear from him or just let things be? 
He’s an addict, and I can’t give an addict an ultimatum because it doesn’t work like that. 
Should I just move on with my life and maintain that boundary that I can’t be in a relationship with someone that is this fragile in their recovery or should I just keep being here to support him emotionally when he gets out just as friends. 

TL;dr : My boyfriend that I love is an alcoholic and keeps relapsing, should I stay and be supportive of his recovery or move on with my life?"
