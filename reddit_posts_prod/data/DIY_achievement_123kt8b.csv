How do I set up a timer for an electrical switch that has a looped on-off schedule,ilishpaturi,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/123kt8b/how_do_i_set_up_a_timer_for_an_electrical_switch/,12,10,"I’m conducting an experiment where I need the intermittent operation of a particular instrument. I require it to be turned on for 5 minutes, followed by 5 minutes of off time; in a loop, throughout the day. What sort of timer device do I need to achieve this looped on-off schedule?

The normal digital timers allow you to set-up a schedule with up to 24 programs or so in a day. That’s simply not enough for us. I’ve heard that Raspberry Pi can be used for this, and while it is an option, I would prefer if some automated system, or low-code option already exists to achieve this. 

Please help!"
