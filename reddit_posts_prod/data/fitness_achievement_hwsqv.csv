What is your proudest fitness related achievement?,ElephantGlue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/hwsqv/what_is_your_proudest_fitness_related_achievement/,12,3,"I'm most proud of the fact that I was able to incline bench press 160 lbs one handed for 4 reps a couple years ago without steroids. This was while I was working in landscaping and I would consistently go to the gym for 2 hours after working 9-12 hour days of hard labor (shoveling tons of DG, demoing concrete with a jack etc...). So what are you proud of?"
