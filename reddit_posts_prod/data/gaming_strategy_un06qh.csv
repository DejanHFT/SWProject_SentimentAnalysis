Trying to get into strategy/turn based games.,Elmo565,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/un06qh/trying_to_get_into_strategyturn_based_games/,13,4,"I have 3 games, civ 5, total war shogun 2, crusader kings 2 and Europa universalis 4 with no dlc. The only game out of the four I truly played was shogun 2 with 30 hours in it. While I did enjoy it I found myself discouraged to play for 2 reasons. One I was not the biggest fan of the battle part, more of a fan of the campaign and 2 I fucking sucked. Haven’t even beat a campaign on normal difficulty. Always made mistakes even after putting some time trying to research. I also downloaded Europa for a bit but I just couldn’t get myself to learn so many things with it. I still need to try civ 5 and crusader kings. I know these are all great games in their own way. I wanted to ask what game should I start with and possibly any advice to stick with it even if it means just toughing through it. I really think I could enjoy these games even if it takes time."
