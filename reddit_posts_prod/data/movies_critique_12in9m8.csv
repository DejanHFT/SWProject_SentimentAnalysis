Hunger (Netflix),lourensloki,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/12in9m8/hunger_netflix/,72,76,"Damn, what a movie! A solid contender for many top 5 lists this year, I would think. Great performances from the cast, and falls very much in line with other movies that critique either food culture of social status, like Parasite or The Menu.

Helps if you enjoy movies that have food as a major theme."
