Help me achieve my fitness goals?,CasenW,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3j1hk8/help_me_achieve_my_fitness_goals/,7,0,"I'm currently 6'0, 140 lbs, major ectomorph. Eating 3,000 calories a day, repping 125 bench (10 reps) 110 lbs squats (10 reps) and 60 pound curls (10 reps). 
Here are my goals:
Learn to do a backflip
Learn to do a planche pushup
Learn to dunk on a 10 ft goal. (My vertical is lacking)
Run a 4.5 40 yard dash, or 4.4 ideally, but that's kind've a question of genetics and whatnot from what I understand.
Get up to nearly 200 lbs, or at least a good weight for my height where I have the kind of physique that commands respect.


I know that's kind of broad, but I'm happy to provide more info if it's needed, I appreciate the help."
