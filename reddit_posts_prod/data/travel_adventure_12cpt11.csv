People seem to be becoming less adventurous with travel,linguistictravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/12cpt11/people_seem_to_be_becoming_less_adventurous_with/,8,0,"I've  read many times that the ""Hippie trail"" from London to Bangkok through  Afghanistan of all places overland used to be quite popular in the 60s  and 70s, apparently Lonely Planet wrote that Kabul was becoming ""overly  touristy"" at the time.

Obviously Afghanistan became a war zone and is still quite dangerous  even now, but it seems to me that few people would even entertain such  an overland journey now even avoiding Afghanistan.

Likewise the ""Marrakesh Express"" journey from London to Marrakesh by  train used to be very popular as well in the same era, but you don't  really hear of anyone doing that any more.

Also, it seems to me that most of the overland companies like  Dragoman have shut down. Obviously Covid was the final nail in the  coffin but I feel like it was an industry that was in decline for some  time.

Now it seems most people just want to be flown into a few specific  destinations set up for mass tourism like Dubai, Bangkok, Cancun,  Coastal med, Marrakesh and are really not very adventurous any more."
