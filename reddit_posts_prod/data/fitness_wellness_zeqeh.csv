Is it possible to build denser muscle rather than bigger?,Lebrontron,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/zeqeh/is_it_possible_to_build_denser_muscle_rather_than/,132,78,"For a while I've been hearing people fighting about muscle growth.


Some say that you can either puff up or build muscle that's smaller but more dense and stronger than regular muscle. 
Like this guy --> http://johnhadzi.com/Wellness/big-muscle-versus-dense-muscle.html

Others call bs and say that there's only one way to strengthen and that's bulking up. The ysay there's no such thing as changing muscle density.

I don't really know which side to take, because of limited knowledge on the subject. I'm just looking for the truth."
