I just want to be healthy while ageing. What is a good exercise routine and lifestyle changes to achieve that?,brazilianredhead,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6rcr6b/i_just_want_to_be_healthy_while_ageing_what_is_a/,41,25,"*A little background and further explaining:*

**Goal:** Maintain my simple and basic ability to walk, get up and sit down without fear of breaking a bone when I'm 70.

**Motivation:** My grandfather is 71 and he still runs, jumps and has a very active life which inspires me to be like him when I get older. However, he served in the military for most of his life, which was probably what allowed him to still be active today. I, on the contrary, am a Developer that spends most of the day sitting in a chair at work.

**Current situation and lifestyle:** I'm 21 M, 5'5 176lbs (170cm / 80kg), working and studying at college, which traps me in a chair for at least 11 hours a day, and in commute for at least 2.5 hours (Wake up for college at 5:30am, arrives home from work at 8:30pm). I've been losing weight for a while now through diet alone, which has been a lot more healthy than it has ever been, but still, I feel like my body can't handle a load of activities I wish it could, and I fear that if I keep walking that path I won't last very long.

My current activities consist of a 15 minutes walk between college and work, and a 10 minute skipping rope / treadmill hiit 3 times a week when I get home, but **every single** article I read about sedentarism states very clearly that a few minutes of exercise do not erase hours of sitting in a chair. An easy way to get a little motion is to get a standing desk, and I have one at home, but I don't have much time to use my pc, so I barely use it, and I can't use one at work (No workplace I asked supports or even allows the use of standing desks in their environment).

I don't want to lose weight, and I don't want to gain muscle. Those would be nice consequences, but they are not my main objective. I just want to live life feeling well and be able to play with my grandchildren when the time comes. What are good and varied exercises / lifestyle changes I can implement to make sure I am on the right path?
