Achievement Unlocked (Tear pants while squatting),The_Brad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ii252/achievement_unlocked_tear_pants_while_squatting/,24,33,"So i've read about it before here and always had a good laugh about it. Happened to me yesterday on my second set of squats and for some reason it actually felt good. Must be something primal about that tearing sound. Anyways, just went on about my session wearing my torn shorts proudly. 

On another note, what is a good pair of pants for squatting. Or rather what features should i be looking for in a pair of pants."
