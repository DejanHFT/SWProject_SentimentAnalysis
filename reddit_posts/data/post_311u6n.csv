Is artificial intelligence possible?,rickjames2014,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/311u6n/is_artificial_intelligence_possible/,4,0,"So, I have had this conundrum in my head the past few days after a conversation with someone who really didn't understand what I was trying to say. 

There is a simple theory that says somewhere there is a digital picture of myself standing on an airplane. Of course I have never been on an airplane or even close to one, but there is a possibility of a particular combination of binary 1's and 0's that could make this possible. The chances of it happening are close to none. 

My question and something I cant seem to understand... If we could try every possible binary combination, or at least begin computing different binary combinations. Would we find something useful? The only catch to this is how do we know what these binary combinations can do? are they compile-able? 

In my opinion, this is the first step to AI. Once the machine can understand code written from outside of itself. Or better yet, self compiling and understanding. It will be able to write its own random code and come up with new programs/pictures/code that are entirely its own. 

Is there anything wrong with this thought process? Is my understanding of AI the same as the people who are currently working on it?"
