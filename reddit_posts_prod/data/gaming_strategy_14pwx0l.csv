Looking for Strategy Games (XBOX S),AmongUsUrMom,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/14pwx0l/looking_for_strategy_games_xbox_s/,4,0,"Hey all! I've recently seen some good-looking strategy games here and there, and I've decided I'm going to dive into this genre. I have some experience with mobile strategy games, but I'm looking for something more serious.

I would prefer if it's free or on Gamepass (I know, I know, I'm a cheapskate). I have an Xbox Series S, so I can run optimised games. If it's premium but relatively cheap, I may consider as long as it's good.

Thanks for any advice!

Edit: to clarify, I mean games like xcom or that new Alien game that's released or is releasing soon, idk"
