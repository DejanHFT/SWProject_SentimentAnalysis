Why are there so many Songs with this Melody?,Last-Lock1521,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/x0630w/why_are_there_so_many_songs_with_this_melody/,7,0,"Hi Reddit,
Over the last year I listened to a lot of music and one Melody stuck in my Head: I heard it often in different songs and I am wondering why it is reused that much. It is also over different genres like rap and edm.
Here are some songs containing it:

- [Lose You by Rawdolff](https://open.spotify.com/track/0EyuGo7LdFiG110rgRHSuf)
- [Teil von mir by KC Rebell (0:52)](https://open.spotify.com/track/6vddVujXmnt9gnUs2mRlNC)
- [COLA (KVSH REMIX)](https://soundcloud.app.goo.gl/2toC6onQmww8wHfL9)
- [Issue by IZKO (slightly changed)](https://open.spotify.com/track/0LF9kHTBv8IMVUDzc6jR4g)

Is it just a coincidence or is there something more behind it? Maybe some of you can help me with this. Thank you!"
