**Rough translation:**

Rough translation:

A Muscovite was walking through the woods

Looking for an adventure

The sun shone from the sky

Beautiful weather!

Suddenly it rang

And the earth trembled

The ingot arrived at the young Muscovite

&#x200B;

And there is no Muscovite

There is no Muscovite

No shit at all

The raw earth itself

Artillery is working

The boys are fucking

One katsap less

And the second shit in his pants

&#x200B;

A Muscovite is sitting in a trench

And holds a kalash (AK riffle)

In tattoos his body

And in the pocket of Anasha

Suddenly it rang

And the field arose

The earth has digested

A young Muscovite

&#x200B;

And there is no Muscovite

There is no Muscovite

No shit at all

The raw earth itself

Artillery is working

The boys are shelling

One katsap less

And the second shit in his pants

&#x200B;

Attack column of equipment

Pskov paratroopers

Sitting down in the bushes

GRU agency

Suddenly it rang

And the diesel was silenced

Beaten paratroopers

The underwear burned down

&#x200B;

And there is no Muscovite

There is no Muscovite

No shit at all

The raw earth itself

Artillery is working

The boys are shelling

One katsap less

And the second shit in his pants

&#x200B;

There was a group of katsaps

Mortar unit

Fuckers are happy

There is a permit for rotation

Suddenly it rang

And life ended

And at the same time health

Of fighting Muscovite

&#x200B;

And there is no Muscovite

There is no Muscovite

No shit at all

The raw earth itself

Artillery is working

The boys are shelling

One katsap less

And the second shit in his pants"
