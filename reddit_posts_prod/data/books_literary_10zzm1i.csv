Give me your literary hot takes,jayoulean,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10zzm1i/give_me_your_literary_hot_takes/,105,0,"Dr. Seuss was a better world builder than J. R. R. Tolkien.

Not taking anything away from the fact that he created a new language with its own alphabet. For instance, Tolkien could have easily cut down Bilbo's birthday party and provide some other kind of lore while taking nothing away. That's an example of world building to a fault.

Dr. Seuss invented the English-adjacent of the Who's that told you just enough of what you needed to know while still allowing your imagination drive the plot. Verbs and especially nouns. He laid the groundwork while you could fill in the gaps."
