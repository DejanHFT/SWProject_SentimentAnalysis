**Reviews**

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/blue-beetle-review-xolo-mariduena-dc-1235567771/):

>A bug worth catching.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/blue-beetle-review-1235696509/):

>The brisk, cheeky, unabashed gizmo-happy triviality of “Blue Beetle,” a superhero origin story from the DC side of the tracks, is enough to make the film feel like a breath of fresh pulp.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2023/08/blue-beetle-review-dc-comic-book-adaptation-latino-family-focus-1235520468/):

>It has more heart and humor than most in this well worn genre. That ought to count for something.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/blue-beetle-review-1234896439/) (C):

>For a film that incessantly natters on about Jaime’s purpose, “Blue Beetle” has bafflingly little sense of what its own might be.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/blue-beetle-review-dc-superhero/):

>A self-contained and smartly crafted film that ranks among the DCEU’s very best. Even though, admittedly, that doesn’t say nearly as much as it ought to.

[Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movies/movie-reviews/blue-beetle-review/) (B+):

>Blue Beetle never loses sight of the community it seeks to honor, not once pandering nor offering surface-level representation of what it means to be Latino.

[Collider](https://collider.com/blue-beetle-review/) (B-):

>Blue Beetle might not be a unique take on the superhero origin story, but Soto and Dunnet-Alcocer do prove that a smaller scale, lighter approach within the DC Universe can work.

[Slashfilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1367519/blue-beetle-review/) (5.5/10):

>Give it a few more drafts and ""Blue Beetle"" may have emerged as something extraordinary. 

[ScreenRant](https://screenrant.com/blue-beetle-review/) (3.5/5):

>While the movie excels in family dynamics and character development, the visual effects and portrayal of the Kord family as villains fall short. Nonetheless, Blue Beetle is a charming depiction of functional family bonds and a promising introduction to a live-action DC superhero.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-beetle-movie-review-dc-xolo-mariduena) (7/10):

>Under Ángel Manuel Soto’s direction, Blue Beetle is a superhero movie that sets itself apart within the bloated genre through the deeply connected bonds of Jaime and the Reyes family.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/16/dc-latino-superhero-film-blue-beetle-review) (3/5):

>There’s a perkiness that’s hard to resist and a base-level competency that’s hard not to appreciate, a small beam of blue light in an otherwise dark time for superheroes.

[AV Club](https://www.avclub.com/a-review-of-dcs-superhero-adventure-blue-beetle-1850742630) (B- ):

>The filmmakers and the SFX team have created a memorable visual style for the film, supported by a wide array of Latino talent that underpins the authenticity of the narrative and the visuals.

[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/08/16/blue-beetle-movie-review/70593366007/) (3/4):

>The DC movie universe has been holding out for a hero, and it might just be a 22-year-old Mexican college grad with a really cool family.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/blue-beetle-movie-review/) (3/5):

>Stand down the undertaker: this spirited outlier shows there’s life in the old DCEU yet. Over to you, Aquaman 2.
