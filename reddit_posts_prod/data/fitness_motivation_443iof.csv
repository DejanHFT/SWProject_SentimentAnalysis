How do you guys stay motivated to get up and go to the gym.,Forgetmepls,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/443iof/how_do_you_guys_stay_motivated_to_get_up_and_go/,208,50,"I've been going for almost two months now, I really enjoy it and have already started noticing I look better. But despite all that getting myself to go STILL feels like a battle with the devil. Not only that the friends that I go with feel the same and it's tough to keep on a regular schedule, although we have kept to it. 

Edit: I've gotten way more advice then i could've hoped for. Thank you to everyone!!!"
