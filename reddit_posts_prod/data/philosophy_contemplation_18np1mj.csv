Fetuses and individuality as the conferrer of a right to life,Next-Pangolin-3895,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/18np1mj/fetuses_and_individuality_as_the_conferrer_of_a/,0,1,"Hello, this is my first post here so I apologize if I don't do this quite correctly. I already messed up by phrasing the title as a question and subsequently having the post removed..  
  
I've been reading some of the older posts with regards to abortion rights and pro-life versus pro-choice stances. I was originally contemplating if a right to life necessarily demands a universal right to food, shelter, and healthcare, but fell down this rabbit-hole instead. Something that I noticed is that most if not all of the posts and discussions I read focused on whether the essence of the concept of a ""right to life"" belonged to human beings or to persons, and that this debate often ended up being the center of the arguments that unfolded. What I would like to consider instead is whether a fetus is an individual, and whether or not the right to life could be defined as applying to individuals instead of either of the two previous categories.  
  
I personally hold that fetuses cannot be considered individuals until they reach viability. As long as they are completely reliant on another individual's body for development and survival, they are not an individual so much as an extension of their host's body. lf we suppose that it is individuality that confers a right to life, and that fetuses that are not yet viable or are non-viable cannot be considered individuals, then pre and nonviable fetuses cannot have a right to life.

I think that this is possibly a reasonable qualifier for the right to life because I believe neither that personhood or humanness is necessarily a good qualifier in its stead. Personhood, though much more closely aligning with my personal beliefs, is extremely difficult to define, and we cannot rely on merely the knowledge we currently have to draw our lines because there is always the possibility that personhood is unseen or unacknowledged in some way. Additionally, some extremists on the pro-choice side would argue depending on their definition of personhood (typically that a person is someone who is self-aware) that babies, infants, and perhaps even some small children might be eligible for euthanasia. There is also a risk of the exclusion of disabled people, people in extended comas, and of course the numerous historic uses of the term personhood to exclude entire groups of people from access to fundamental rights. Humanness, while countering all of these issues of personhood, I find to be far too limited in scope. I don't think it's unreasonable to suggest that animals should have a right to life where possible, while also acknowledging that sometimes our morals cannot be applied easily or cleanly to the real world. Additionally, some species have been documented to have intelligence comparable to human children. If a human child has the right to life, why shouldn't such comparable species? This is one of the arguments that is generally classified under the defense of personhood. I also worry that humanness as a qualifier could also be too easily extended to the idea that ""if only humans have the right to life, perhaps only humans have a right to humane treatment"" by people who will not think critically about the fact that these are two separate and distinct claims that each need their own defense. I saw at least one person in a previous discussion say that the right to life is fundamental to all other rights, and thus to have those other rights one must first have a right to life. This argument extends naturally to the idea that it is okay to abuse animals because if they do not have a right to life, any other right (such as humane treatment) is denied in turn. Most people would reject this stance, and thus most people find the capacity to suffer is an important consideration in the treatment of other beings, favoring personhood to some extent. Individuality is similar to humanness in that it is a slightly more objective measure than personhood (I say slightly because while it is generally less abstract in definition than personhood, it is still somewhat more abstract than humanness (which is also itself a somewhat arbitrary taxonomic classification)) while also being less limited and arbitrary in scope than humanness (why should only humans be granted a right to life?).  
  
I understand that there are problems with the assertion that individuality should be the measure of a right to life that must be addressed. If we consider that individuals have a right to life, then that would necessarily demand that we ask what counts as an individual. If we consider that individuals are unique living organisms that exist apart from other living organisms, then that would necessitate that all birthed and viable living organisms that are individuals. But what about colony organisms? Are they individuals if they functionally exist as a unit? Or parasites? Are they considered individuals if they, similar to the human fetus, demand another organism's body to survive? Or is there some property that holds them distinct from their host? Does that property also apply to the fetus? I could imagine that the distinction could be that while a parasite requires another organism to feed off of, much as a lion requires prey for food, that a fetus differs because it is grown directly from its hosts cells and therefore is part of the cellular mass of their body. However, this could possibly be countered by the fact that the mother's body must undergo an immunosuppressant response during pregnancy to prevent the body from rejection its offspring in utero. Considering this, is the fetus separate or a part of the mother? 

I don't believe that being genetically different from the host is necessarily a qualifier for an individual in this case, as humans and other organisms can also display characteristics of chimerism and other genetic anomalies that would cause a single individual to be counted as two under a model of genetic distinction as the primary indicator. This would also rule out all asexually reproducing organisms as individuals. Since asexual reproduction extends across all domains of life, I find this a difficult qualifier. Additionally, another caveat that I find is that one single organism is not necessarily an individual. Siamese twins would be the primary example, where one body holds two fully developed brains and personalities. If you were to attempt to separate the twins, they both would likely die as a result, and therefore must remain connected. This does not diminish either twin's right to life. Considering this, and that the fetus does develop its own brain, could it be considered distinct from the mother despite being necessarily connected? Or must there be a degree of consciousness for this to be the case? This issue leans back into the idea of personhood, which I would like to separate from individuality as a potential qualifier if possible.

While there are problems with this concept, there are also problems with the other two concepts (humanness and personhood) that come up routinely with regards to ideas about responsibility, agency, categorization, and subjective vs objective moral stances, and as a result I don't find this to be an issue unique to individuality.  
  
Lastly, I saw that several arguments in previous discussions used animals as an example why personhood is not the conferrer of the right to life as opposed to humanness (one I saw said that claiming a rabbit had a right to life or a grasshopper was ridiculous). While some people mentioned that this assertion must also be defended to be allowed to serve as a basis for argumentation, I found that this was not as common as the assertion itself. I acknowledge that while I don't ascribe to the idea that animals necessarily have a right to life because I have reason to believe believe that many species are essentially amoral in their conduct, I don't have a very strong argument with regards to this stance and know that it is flawed.  
  
I hope this makes sense, and am curious as to other people's thoughts on this matter. Politically, I fall into the camp of pro-choice (in particular the termination until viability stance) and I vehemently oppose the overturning of Roe v. Wade, but the pro-lifers I've seen discussing the subject in this subreddit have a lot of good arguments and I want to hear differing perspectives."
