Please help. I feel like I have lost all my creativity.,KTDesign,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/ehvsvj/please_help_i_feel_like_i_have_lost_all_my/,4,2,"Hi. I don't really know where else to turn to. I feel like I have lost all my creativity. 

I started drawing when I was 4, and eventually taught myself how to draw realistically pretty well just from YouTube videos when I was about 14. After that, I took a college drawing course which completely destroyed my passion for drawing. I stopped drawing for 3 years after that because every time I drew it just pissed me off. 

Earlier this year I graduated from community college with my AA + few certificates in graphic design along with my general ed done. I transferred to a CSU this fall semester and also started to live on campus. I took a drawing course and a 3D (traditional, not digital) course to satisfy prerequisites. Through all of this I also started working a job on campus as a designer for a department. My schedule has been non-stop for roughly 2.5mo. I started to draw for my class, it was time consuming but somewhat rewarding. 

This past 1.5mo or so I have had no creativity, barely any ideas, nothing. I've never faced this before. I was going into class and work unable to think or execute anything. I assumed it was because I was overworked and overloaded...but I've had the past 2 weeks off, and nothing has come back. I still feel like I have the biggest mental block ever right now. And I've been stressed out about work this entire break. 

Although I have faced frustration, lack of motivation, and mind blocks before, especially in my first college drawing course... I've never had it this bad before.

I'm extremely anxious, frustrated, and frankly, terrified. Design has been my passion for the past 3 years. Now it feels like nothing but stress to me because I can't do anything. I've been freaking out. I just want my old self/mind back. I don't know what's wrong with me. It's so incredibly frustrating, nothing I've been trying has worked. 

Does anyone have ANY suggestions?? I am seriously willing to try anything that may help me. I want my passion and life back. I've been so heartbroken about this. Thank you."
