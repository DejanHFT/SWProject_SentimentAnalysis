"I'm 17, an Astronomy enthusiast. Want to study astronomy in future.",terbuj100,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/pzukxz/im_17_an_astronomy_enthusiast_want_to_study/,19,79,"Most probably next year I'll be taking BS-MS Physics , 5 year integrated course, as there is no dedicated Bachelor's degree in astronomy here in my country. But not really sure how I am going to pursue higher education, in order to be an Astrophysicist.

Would appreciate all suggestions."
