"LA LA LAND and the critique of its bad ""singing and dancing""",Slight_Giraffe628,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/17bo2ut/la_la_land_and_the_critique_of_its_bad_singing/,508,1439,"I constantly see this critique as recently as today, that specifically the singing in the movie is pitiful. I despise this argument because it is very obvious, that ryan and emmas audio and singing is actually happening in camera. Something that i personally have not seen done very often or at all. 

Unlike almost every musical where the singing is done post filming and autotuned to hell, La La Land gives us the raw audio, them singing and acting at the same time. Giving the movie its very raw, emotional, and genuine tone which can be lost in many other musicals that have that clean autotuned and overproduced singing and dancing. 

Im surprised people dont realise this, I noticed it on my first viewing, as you could tell mia and sebastians audio was analogue while the backround singers (or the smaller characters singing parts) were certainly post production."
