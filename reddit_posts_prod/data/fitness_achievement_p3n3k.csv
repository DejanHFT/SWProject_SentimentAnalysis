Ideas for new Fitocracy achievements needed!,xenowang,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/p3n3k/ideas_for_new_fitocracy_achievements_needed/,116,39,"Hey Fittit! 

We haven't added any new achievements on Fitocracy lately and we could use some ideas, so where else to look but Fittit, right? So far we've got plenty of achievements for a variety of compound lifts involving barbells/dumbbells, quite a few cardio activities, etc. But we're looking to expand these aggressively. So let's hear your ideas! A few notes:

1. Doesn't necessarily have to be based on a specific exercise.
2. Several of your suggestions will invariably take some time for us to support depending on development needs.
3. Try to be creative. Exercise milestones, streaks, combos, whatever - just go nuts.
4. Including a clever title would be preferable :)
5. We'll credit you if we end up introducing it (assuming we aren't already planning it)

**UPDATE: Ok, I get it, you couldn't give two shits about new achievements right now. We are pushing a new scoring system for strength exercises this week. Won't make excuses for the scoring weirdness or outstanding bugs. We are working on a fuckton of things.**"
