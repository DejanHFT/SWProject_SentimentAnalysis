Tips for exploring new countries and cultures like a local,cocoprezzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15xd7lg/tips_for_exploring_new_countries_and_cultures/,10,2,"My parents and I recently went to Istanbul for the first time and were extremely excited before going. We always read and heard great things about the city, that the food is incredible, shopping was great, sites were beautiful. We did a lot of research and thought we had a great trip planned, but ultimately in the end were a bit disappointed with our experience. 

I will say that the sites in Istanbul were beautiful, and I loved learning about the country’s history. We also appreciated the extremely reliable public transport system. But the food and shopping didn’t uphold the same standard. 

While prices for shopping were extremely affordable, it was hard finding things of quality. The food was also terrible. Granted we were in Sultanahmet, which is a very touristy neighborhood, but we were surprised we couldn’t even find a simple kebab place that was decent. 

We did our research online before going, but it became apparent that Google’s search results prioritized reviews from whitewashed tourists that either don’t know better or were paid to provide a good review. Things like Google reviews, yelp reviews, trip advisor, etc. are not very reliable if you are looking for a more authentic experience. It would have been great to know that Sultanahmet is a great location for site-seeing, but not the best for food before arriving vs figuring it out bad experience after bad experience. 

Does anyone have any advice or tips on what they do to find non-tourist traps when they travel to new places? Not just in Istanbul specifically but for traveling in general. I want to plan a trip to Costa Rica and Portugal next year but don’t know where to start."
