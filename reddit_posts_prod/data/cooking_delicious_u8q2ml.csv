Tell me a delicious dish I've never heard of,krlidb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/u8q2ml/tell_me_a_delicious_dish_ive_never_heard_of/,243,150,"I'm starting a ""Cook Club"" among about 5 other friends. The idea is that, once a month, we will cook through the same recipe and share pictures and thoughts. Every third month, instead of selecting a recipe, we will just select a dish. It will be up to each individual to research, find recipes or techniques, and make that dish. We will then all meet up with a bunch of other friends and do blind tastings to determine our favorite take on the dish, which will be added to our crowdsourced cookbook.    
    
BIGGEST RULE: Every dish we make needs to be new to everyone in the group. Something no one has made before. We have a couple adventurous cooks in the group, so I'm interested in delicious recipes from around the world, that perhaps an American has never heard of or considered making.    
    
So hit me with your best dishes! We're in an area that's has a fair amount of international markets, so don't be afraid to throw in interesting ingredients.     
    
Some examples I have on the list so far: Vatapa (brazilian seafood stew), Coda alla vaccinara (roman braised oxtail), Tikin Xic (Mayan ""dry"" fish, marinated in orange and achiote and cooked in a banana leaf), French Cassoulet, Khachipuri (Georgian Cheese Bread).

Edit: Wow, more responses than I can get through today. Thanks for the ideas all, this is exactly what I was looking for"
