Are melodys suposed to fit in the vocals?,i3ene71,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/wbava7/are_melodys_suposed_to_fit_in_the_vocals/,1,0,"

Hey, i‘ve been wondering if melodys  have to fit on vocals. 
For example the dont worry remix from david guetta has this dö dö dödö. This instrument melody fits also on the vocals. Is this in every edm song? Or can the drop/ melody of the song be something diffrent than the vocals?  I hope you understand what i mean:)"
