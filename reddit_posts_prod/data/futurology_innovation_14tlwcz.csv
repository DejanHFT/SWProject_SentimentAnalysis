How realistic is it to believe that AI will eventually lead the way for technological innovations?,WomboShlongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14tlwcz/how_realistic_is_it_to_believe_that_ai_will/,74,45,"I’m talking about having AI develop cures for diseases based on (I have no biomed knowledge, talking out of my ass here) stuff like how proteins fold and interact with each other. Making more efficient means for energy production/storage using means and materials we have yet to think of. Things that will change/make an impact on civilization as we know. 

 I’d imagine anything of the sorts is probably beyond my lifetime, but with the recent buzz around AI and how much financial support has been poured into that industry lately, could there be said changes within a decade or two?"
