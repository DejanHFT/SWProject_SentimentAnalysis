Is the vast Sahara Desert the main explanation to why sub-Saharan Africa was historically under-developed and insulated from other cultures?,dyce123,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/q33zm8/is_the_vast_sahara_desert_the_main_explanation_to/,164,214,"Why does most history about the African continent usually revolve around a few nations usually in the north i.e Egypt, Libya and Ethiopia? Why is there such a vacuum in sub-Saharan African history before the 19th Century even though some parts are geographically closer to Europe (center of most historical empires) than most parts of Russia and Asia?

For an area that large, with a good climate, fertility and close to Europe, I would expect it to have been settled on by foreigners much earlier than they did or at least technology and culture to be shared between them.

Is the difficulty of traversing the Sahara desert, the best explanation for this? Africa being so close yet so far?"
