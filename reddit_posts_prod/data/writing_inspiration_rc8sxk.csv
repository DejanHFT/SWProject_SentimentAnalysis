Why do I feel more inspired at night?,emriverawriter,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/rc8sxk/why_do_i_feel_more_inspired_at_night/,65,304,"It's weird, because every day, I want to write, but I feel less drive for it. I feel *extremely* lazy. But when bedtime's around the corner, the fire lights up. Any thoughts?

Edit: thank you all for your support and the award!!!!"
