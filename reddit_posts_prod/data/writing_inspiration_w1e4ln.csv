Needing ANTI-Inspiration,BoomerTheStar47_2,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/w1e4ln/needing_antiinspiration/,24,0,"Long story short, I got an idea for a story, quickly figured out I lacked the skills to do it properly, and am now looking for another idea. Only problem is, the old idea just refuses to die, and keeps finding ways to crawl into the new ideas.

Basically, Iâ€™m looking for a way to completely shut down the old idea for good, by any means necessary.

Thanks in advance!"
