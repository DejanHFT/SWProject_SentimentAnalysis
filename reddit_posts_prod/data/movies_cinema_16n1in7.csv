Collective audience disappointment. Which film you saw at the cinema had the greatest tangible sense of being a let down to you and everyone else?,Fair_Suspect8866,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16n1in7/collective_audience_disappointment_which_film_you/,2194,1809,"Back in 2015 I was looking forward to a version of JG Ballard's High-Rise that was about to be released.

The trailer was good, the artwork was excellent and tastefully riffed on A Clockwork Orange. Tom Hiddleston was the lead. I even paid to see it at the Barbican in London. A more fitting brutalist setting you can't imagine. Anticipation was high, the audience was keen. 

But the film was flat, confusing and dull. At the end of the film it was like the air had been sucked out if the room. Like everyone wanted to forget they were there. I've never felt anything quite like it at the cinema. 

What's been your most memorable audience deflation?"
