Adventure Sports Recommendations In Northern Italy??,NugsRLyfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/uaui5o/adventure_sports_recommendations_in_northern_italy/,7,4,"Hello everyone!

I'm currently traveling through the north of Italy stopping in towns and cities as I go. I'm currently in the tuscan region right outside of Florence and I was hoping to find some exciting adventure sports while I'm here.  I'm here for a few more days and then possibly heading to bologna next. I'd like something like white water rafting, cliff diving, climbing or something of that nature? Anyone who has had experience or recommendations with anything fun outdoors here would be greatly appreciated!"
