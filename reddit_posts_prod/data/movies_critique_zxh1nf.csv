"What makes a movie ""simple,"" and why is it a bad thing?",branman887,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/zxh1nf/what_makes_a_movie_simple_and_why_is_it_a_bad/,46,9,"This topic has of course been brought up by the release of Avatar 2. As someone who was lukewarm on the first I thought the sequel was great; visually spectacular and emotionally engaging.

And yet one of the biggest criticisms I see with both Avatars is that ""the story is too weak, too simple."" But is that a valid critique? It's fine to say a movie didn't connect with you, but to me that kind of criticism is what seems truly simple.

When people levy these criticisms, what do they mean? That the plot isn't full of twists in turns, like a Christopher Nolan film? Or that it doesn't have nuanced, complex characters?

I guess that could be a valid criticism, but if a movie doesn't set out to be those things, then it's really not.

It just feels like internet armchair quarterbacking and the industry's obsession with franchises has changed how so many people interpret film, and has devalued the virtue of simplicity.

This is ironic because simple movies make up some of the greatest films of all time. Alien is simple. Shawshank Redemption is simple. Any beloved Disney animated film from the 90s is simple. 

Sorry this turned into a bit of a rant. What do you think? Is simplicity bad? What makes a movie ""simple?"" And why do you think some use this claim as a critique?"
