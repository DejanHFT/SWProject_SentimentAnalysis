Finally bought Triangle Strategy,Faldbat,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/v9ng7y/finally_bought_triangle_strategy/,9,4,"Tactics RPGs probably would qualify as my favorite game genre (Final Fantasy Tactics, fire emblem,  and ogre battle occupy spots in my top 15 all time games, consistently).

That being said, I never bought triangle strategy,  because Diablo 2 resurrected had stolen my last 400 hours of game time.

So, reddit, as the game downloads, what should I know? And how did you like this game?"
