"id like some actual critique on ""Snow on tha Bluff""",gucci_flocka_flame,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1r1l9r/id_like_some_actual_critique_on_snow_on_tha_bluff/,1,1,"i've watched it about 3 or 4 times, and i just simply don't know how to feel. it's by far the most accurate depiction of life in a really shitty part of the ghetto that I've seen. but it's also just not a very good film in terms of the way it's put together. there's a ton of room for improvement, but i see it as underrated only due to the fact that it is so raw. 
i think if you're looking at it as a documentary instead of a scripted movie (which it's about half and half due to legalities) it's not bad at all.

for anyone who hasnt seen it, it's on netflix instant streaming and is virtually incomprehensible without subtitles, unless you are well versed in some serious ghetto lingo.  "
