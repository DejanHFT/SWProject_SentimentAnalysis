Have you realized that what you are writing is clearly inspired by something else?,CM-NYY-DJ-FAN,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/aphu9s/have_you_realized_that_what_you_are_writing_is/,94,326,"The latest scene of my novel involves a character arriving in a village where they ask the protagonist for help. This tribe (led by one of my secondary antagonists) takes half of the harvest from this village as protection, then go to try to raid the capital. They ask my protagonist for help to protect them. I thought it was a clever scene before I realized, goddamit this is Seven Samurai. Have any of you ever done the same?"
