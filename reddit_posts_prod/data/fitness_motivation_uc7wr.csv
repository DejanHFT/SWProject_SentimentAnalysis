"Most depressing ""motivation"" I've ever read...",Vermonster87,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/uc7wr/most_depressing_motivation_ive_ever_read/,271,55,"http://danceswithfat.wordpress.com/

So long story short, I first saw a danceswithfat article in the body of an /r/fitness post a few days ago and thought it was sad that so many people seem to really follow what the blog says and use it to justify their lifestyles.  Since then, I've been seeing this site jumping up all over the place, both on reddit and spread out across the web.  

Do you guys and gals think that this is a good trend, because it is motivating people to be happy with themselves?  I tend to be overly cynical, however I'm having a hard time imaging many ways in which this type of fat affirmation is doing anything other than harm."
