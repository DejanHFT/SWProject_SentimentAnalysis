How to prepare for entrepreneurship?,butterrrscotch,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/t1c85e/how_to_prepare_for_entrepreneurship/,2,5,"Hi all,

Currently I'm studying aerospace engineering. Since I was a kid I've always wanted to start a business so that's what I'm gonna do I after graduating. I've only just started going to university and so it it will take at least 3 years before I can fully focus on a business and that's why I'd like to prepare as good as I can during this period.

Up till now I've started a few small businesses and read some books on entrepreneurship but most information has been forgotten as I'm not able to implement it into my life. I've a very strong vision of who I want to become and what I want to achieve but have no business idea yet. Also, there are some events for entrepreneurship at my university that I'm attending. Besides this I don't know what I could do more to prepare and make sure the business is gonna succeed. Do you have any suggestions? Perhaps some important topics I need to know about or any relevant podcasts I could listen to."
