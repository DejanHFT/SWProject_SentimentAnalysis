[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/haunted-mansion-review-lakeith-stanfield-tiffany-haddish-owen-wilson-1235538263/):

>Beats waiting in line for the ride, but just barely.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/haunted-mansion-review-lakeith-stanfield-tiffany-haddish-1235678503/):

>While the visual effects are surprisingly weak for a film of this scale, the script proves far better than anyone might expect, establishing an emotional foundation for what might otherwise be a gimmick-driven haunted house movie.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/haunted-mansion-review-movie-2023-1234888176/) (C-):

>Too scattershot and herky-jerky to ever approximate the feeling of a ride, the ghost sequences stop and start without any sense of place, rhythm, or purpose.

[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/haunted-mansion-2023-review/) (4/5):

>Family-friendly, spooky fun with surprising emotional heft and an ensemble cast clearly having a ball.

[Collider](https://collider.com/haunted-mansion-movie-review/) (B+):

>It might not be deeply hilarious or legitimately scary, but that's exactly what a narrative adaptation of this ride needs to be, threading that line while also remaining fun throughout.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/haunted-mansion-movie-review-justin-simien-disney/):

>“Haunted Mansion” is a fun summer throwback to the likes of 2003’s “Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.” Inventive fun for every member of the family with a phenomenal lead performance by Stanfield.

[AV Club](https://www.avclub.com/a-review-of-disneys-haunted-mansion-1850673119):

>It would be interesting to see the version of Haunted Mansion that star LaKeith Stanfield seems to think he’s in—one where his jaded, grieving, scientist-turned-wannabe believer in ghosts could see his grounded performance matched

[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/haunted-mansion-review/) (3.5/5):

>Thanks to a fun and simple script, enhanced by Justin Simien’s exhilarating and creative direction, Haunted Mansion is a welcomed surprise.

[Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2023-07-25/haunted-mansion-review-disneyland-ride-lakeith-stanfield-tiffany-haddish):

>Because no effort has been expended to make any of this even remotely scary -- there are only so many times you can watch Stanfield dodge a flying CGI axe -- you might at least hope for a belly laugh or two, or at least a few decent jokes.

[Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/23807463/haunted-mansion-remake-review-lakeith-stanfield-owen-wilson):

>The subset it resonates with, Haunted Mansion is a grim, grinning delight.

[ComicBook.com](https://comicbook.com/movies/news/haunted-mansion-review-disney-movie-2023/) (4/5):
>At long last, Haunted Mansion finally gets the adaptation the beloved ride has always deserved – a fun, scary, and surprisingly emotional time at the movies. It’s certainly Disney's best live-action movie since Pirates of the Caribbean.

[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/07/25/haunted-mansion-review-disney-comedy/70457342007/) (2.5/4):

>A good first horror movie for youngsters where a ghostly mummy won’t have them running for their mommy.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/haunted-mansion-review) (8/10):

>A soulful ghost story that does an unexpectedly solid job speaking to younger audiences about the afterlife, nailing the film’s appropriately spooky gateway-horror ambitions.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/25/haunted-mansion-review-disney-lakeith-stanfield-rosario-dawson-jamie-lee-curtis) (2/5):

>In the end, it’s another piece of Halloween merchandise.

[Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/haunted-mansion-review-a-horror-comedy-thats-neither-scary-nor-funny/):

>Alas, Haunted Mansion is yet another reminder that the assembling of a great cast does not guarantee a great movie. Director Justin Simien and screenwriter Katie Dippold can’t seem to find any kind of comedic rhythm


[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2023/07/25/haunted-mansion-movie-review/) (1.5/4):

>
It’s too dark for a family film, too weightless and juvenile for grown-ups. In a season notable for high-level action spectacle and important auteur projects, Haunted Mansion is not just confused but inconsequential.
