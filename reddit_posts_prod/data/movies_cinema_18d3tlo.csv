What movie changed your life in the cinema?,yorkshiretea23,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18d3tlo/what_movie_changed_your_life_in_the_cinema/,203,348,"I watched 500 Days of Summer with my ex at the cinema. In the second half of the movie, in tears, he got up and walked out. He eventually came back in, but wouldn’t look at me. He could barely watch the rest of the film. When we got out onto the street he said “you’re never going to love me like I love you.” 2 months later we split up (turns out he was right)."
