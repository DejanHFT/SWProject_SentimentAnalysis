Where some of my motivation comes from.,Wecanbefriendsnow,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3iumd3/where_some_of_my_motivation_comes_from/,55,124,"Recently I moved to Japan. 

After finding out my local gym was $80 a month and only open 10am to 11pm I found a cheaper community gym. 

In the gym I'm usually the youngest person there. I'm 31. Sometimes there is one or two young dudes but mainly elderly people working out every day. 

These gyms help me be motivated. Because I know that when I'm at home on reddit that there are people over twice my age already half way through their workout. 

These guys don't fuck around either. They are always working hard no matter what. 

Who inspires you at your gym? 

Edit: 11am to 11pm."
