> Critics consensus: *Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore* avoids some of the pitfalls that plagued its predecessor, but lacks much of the magic that drew audiences into the wizarding world many movies ago.

[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore): 47/100 (21 critics)

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** 

> The long-awaited third installment of J.K. Rowling’s Wizarding World sub-franchise is less clogged with distracting detail than its immediate predecessor, but even a more refined plot can’t save the two-hour-plus film from feeling like an endurance test.

-[Lovia Gyarkye, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore-film-j-k-rowling-1235125145/)

> While “The Secrets of Dumbledore” doesn’t exactly embrace simplicity, the screenplay — no longer credited to Rowling alone, but co-written by stalwart “Harry Potter” adapter Steve Kloves — feels far more focused. Happily, the execution proves that much easier to follow.

-[Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2022/film/reviews/fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore-review-1235224900/)

> The series’ third outing, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore, falls into precisely the same traps as its predecessor, offering up an unwieldy, mostly unsettling mash-up of adult themes and childish whimsy, made still more inscrutable by too many subplots, too many characters, and a tone that veers wildly off-course at every possible turn.

> While Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore finally makes Dumbledore canonically gay, it does little else of note, remaining scattered across half a dozen inconsequential subplots for most of its runtime. It looks drab and feels like it was made by people who want to leave its magical premise behind, even though the series refuses to have anything resembling grown-up politics or perspectives.

-[Siddhant Adlakha, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore-review): 4.0 ""bad""

> It’s good-natured entertainment, though there is still something weightless and formless about the narrative.

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/05/fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore-review-good-natured-magical-entertainment): 3/5

> This latest entry in the franchise mostly goes through the motions, making a big deal out of revelations that fans will find old-hat, unceremoniously closing the door or ignoring storylines that previously seemed to be important, and sidelining characters who used to be the protagonists. There’s not a CGI monster that can distract from how un-fantastic this “Beasts” is.

-[William Bibbiani, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/fantastic-beasts-secrets-of-dumbledore-film-review-harry-potter-wizarding-world/)

> “Secrets” does a decent job streamlining the busy storytelling in the third of a planned five-movie series that, to be honest, doesn’t have the clearest overarching narrative. And with a surprisingly good climax to go along with Mikkelsen totally understanding his assignment, this “Beasts” is never a burden to watch.

-[Brian Truitt, USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/04/05/fantastic-beasts-3-review-mads-mikkelsen-harry-potter/7249746001/): 3/4

> It can be said, with some certainty, that ‘Fantastic Beasts’ has finally found its footing. This latest entry is the most fun and most buoyant in the relatively young series. And it’s enough to make you actually look forward to a subsequent installment (should there be one) instead of actively dreading it. “Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore” pulled off the most impressive magic trick of all: making you care about this franchise.

-[Drew Taylor, The Playlist](https://theplaylist.net/fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore-review-franchise-footing-20220405/): B

> With the continuation of this franchise already assured, its pivot away from Newt and toward Dumbledore is bound to continue, and so is the way the story keeps delving further into inconsequential mythos, as the timeline inches toward World War II. But insofar as this is a movie about finding hope in a bleak time, it inspires little for its own future. The studio and creators behind these movies will keep trying to be whatever they surmise the public wants. Failing that, they’re willing to settle for turning them into whatever we’re willing to pay for.
