Adventurous and unique destination for a February trip?,Apprehensive-Job-358,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/rzil36/adventurous_and_unique_destination_for_a_february/,51,17,"My wife and I are are in our late 20s and we love to travel. Staying close to home throughout the pandemic has really given us the itch to get out on a fun international trip. We are looking to go in February 2023 when I’ll be able to get some work off. We are both very outdoorsy and active and want something adventurous and unique. We will have about 2 weeks and are hoping to keep it to \~$5,000 or less. We are open to any climate but I have a slight preference toward somewhere warm to get out of the winter weather here. That said, a northern lights and dogsledding trip also sounds pretty cool. We are in the western U.S.

We want to go somewhere neither of us has ever been, and we are more into beautiful nature and adventures than big cities and touristy sites. Some places one or both of us have been in the past include Hawaii, Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, several countries in East Africa (a safari would have been my top pick if I hadn't already been), and several countries in Europe.

Some places that have come to mind so far include the Galápagos Islands, Turks & Caicos, Patagonia, Iceland, New Zealand, Thailand, and others. We want a unique and memorable trip that we can make the most of while we are still young and fit before we start having kids and it gets a little more difficult for a few years. Preferably not a cruise (as my wife gets seasick) but we are open to anything!

Looking forward to your suggestions! Thank you in advance!!"
