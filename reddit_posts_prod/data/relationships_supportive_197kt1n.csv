Supporting my afro indigenous partner through endless discrimination.,tsm012,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/197kt1n/supporting_my_afro_indigenous_partner_through/,4,4,"I (35M) have an afro indigenous partner (28F) who works in a white male dominated industry (aviation). We've been together 2 years. Pretty much every day she comes home and tells me stories of how someone at work tried to discount her, question her knowledge, make fun of her hair, or that her students will simply say racist and/or sexist things about her because she's not a white male. In the past I would ask questions or maybe even suggest things, but have found that since I'm a white male, I can't really understand what she's going through and it's best I not say much and just be there for her. I feel helpless, and watching her come home daily totally defeated saying stuff like ""no one thinks I'm human"" or ""no one will help me because they are all racist"" or ""If I complain I'll be kicked out of the industry and no one will hire me because I'm a 'troublemaker'"" hurts my soul.

TL;DR how should I as a white male partner support my partner through a neverending sea of discrimination, racism."
