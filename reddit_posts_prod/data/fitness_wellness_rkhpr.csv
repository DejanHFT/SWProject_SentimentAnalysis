How well can muscle gain mask fat loss?,ItWorksInTheShower,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rkhpr/how_well_can_muscle_gain_mask_fat_loss/,29,19,"I started counting calories 6 weeks ago using MyFitnessPal. I've been pretty thorough with it (I weigh my food, etc., and absolutely no alcohol), and I've managed about a 4000cal/week deficit.

I am 24 years old, 6'0"" tall, and 170lbs and 15-18% BF (down from a max of 215 and 20-25% BF, which I hit about 4 years ago). I'm in the gym 3-4 days/week and run 6miles on rest days usually twice a week. I have essentially been at a maintenance diet since I started losing weight, so I have never had a true bulking phase. But last month I resolved to lose my belly fat and love handles, so I decided to really start cutting, and I accepted my current strength level and musculature until I can get down to around 10% body fat.

I'm currently taking a LeanGains approach with IF. I definitely noticed physical changes after the first 3 weeks or so. My pants were looser and my stomach and obliques started tightening up. My only concern is I have only lost about 2 pounds over the past 6 weeks after running a 4000kcal/week deficit based off an estimated 2700kcal daily requirement. I feel that my diet should promoted at least a 1lb/week loss. Is it really possible that I am overestimating my daily metabolic needs that much, or is it possible that I am still gaining enough muscle to account for the other 2-3lbs I was expecting to lose? I haven't made significant strength gains in the past 6 weeks, so I am baffled here.

I've only been on Fittit for about 2 months, and the information has been very helpful, but I am still learning."
