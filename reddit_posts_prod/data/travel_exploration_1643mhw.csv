Listening to Stand up comedy albums while exploring really helps me remember.,EquivalentBadger8,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1643mhw/listening_to_stand_up_comedy_albums_while/,2,3,"I solo travelled thru the UK last year and was heavy on the standup comedy albums the whole time. The Edinburgh Fringe festival may have had part to play in that, but it had a fantastic lasting effect. 

Now when I hear Mitch Hedberg it reminds me of Stonehenge.

 Bill burr brings me back to Inverness. 

Patrice O'Neal  reminds me of the architecture in Bath. 

Doug Stanhope reminds me of climbing up Arthur's seat and all of Edinburgh really. 

Dave Attell reminds me of the castle tavern in Inverness. 

Not to mention the random other comedians that popped up on shuffle.  There's an Al Madrigal joke I heard today that reminded me of the way the National gallery smelled. 

Can anyone relate?"
