Better sites for exploring flights on non-specific dates and destinations?,anetanetanet,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/14n2ml8/better_sites_for_exploring_flights_on_nonspecific/,15,25,"What I want to account for in a search is a specific number of days within a certain period (say, between 23rd of july and 15th of august), price range, flight time. I usually use momondo, kayak or google flights for the better flexibility, but they lack in certain areas which makes the search more annoying. Kayak and Momondo don't show me current flight prices, so in many instances it would show me a flight within my price range, i click on it and when I go to the actual website the price is double. A lot of the time on momondo I'll put in say, 6-8 days a month from x date and it just... won't work. 

I am especially annoyed tho with the price issue. The whole point of searching like this is to find the best price+destination combo, not have to triple check everything on different websites."
