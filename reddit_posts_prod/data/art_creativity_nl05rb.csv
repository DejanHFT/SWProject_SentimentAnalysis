i can draw but i have no imagination or creativity,stikinthebox,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/nl05rb/i_can_draw_but_i_have_no_imagination_or_creativity/,15,20,i’m 17 and i’ve been taking my art “seriously” since i was 12.  i think i’m kinda good at drawing but the problem is i never know what to draw. no matter how long i wait no light bulbs ever go off. i can only draw fanart or draw this in your style challenges. i’ve never thought up an original character or anything creative. i feel like i have absolutely no imagination. i’ve even tried looking for tips for writing to see if that would work but nope. i just want to have OCs to draw and daydream creative scenarios with. i can’t even daydream. i’ve just promts and all that. i want ideas to come somewhat naturally to me. i just get so frustrated that i can’t be imaginative like all my artist friends. when i ask them how they get there ideas they just say it just popped up or came naturally.  i feel like i don’t even enjoy art anymore. it just makes me sad now.  please tell me how i can make my brain be like everyone else’s.
