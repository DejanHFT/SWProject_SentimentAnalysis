Going to the gym in the morning for the first time in 8 years. I weigh 315 pounds. Does anyone have any tips or a bit of motivation that I can take some confidence with me. I know I need to do this. Thank you.,IriGetmylifetogether,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/24np4i/going_to_the_gym_in_the_morning_for_the_first/,232,387,"I'm so nervous and nearly on the verge of a panic attack to go to the gym in the morning. I weigh 315 pounds and I know I have a long road ahead of me to get fit and in shape but i'm so nervous about the first step and just getting back into the gym and fitness. All and every bit of help is very much welcomed. Thank you.

Thank you so much to each and every person who took time out of their life to comment to me. I broke down in tears by the kindness of strangers to this overweight Irish guy. I went to the gym and it was a lot easier knowing I had the kind words,advice and help from ye guys. I can't thank ye enough. I will post pictures one day , that is just another issue I need to get over. "
