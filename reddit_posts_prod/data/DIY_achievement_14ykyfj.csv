My wife wanted to buy a plant stand online. I told her if she gave me 6 months I could do much better.,factoryal21,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14ykyfj,556,9068,"Not exactly an original scenario but it is literally what happened, she was looking at this plant display stand on Etsy and I said I could do better. It only took me half a year and 2000 bucks in raw materials. Iâ€™m a hobbyist working in my spare time out of my basement shop so a project like this is a big achievement for me."
