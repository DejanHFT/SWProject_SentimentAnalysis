Does the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics make any unique predictions? What is a reversible quantum computer?,chipbuddy,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2yvkgg/does_the_many_worlds_interpretation_of_quantum/,2,5,"I found [this](http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm) FAQ about the Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics written by Michael Clive Price (who is that?). 

The FAQ contains [this](http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#unique) section about the unique predictions of the MWI. What is a reversible machine intelligence? And why does this experiment require an AI on par with human intelligence? Is this FAQ full of crap? Does MWI actually make unique predictions?"
