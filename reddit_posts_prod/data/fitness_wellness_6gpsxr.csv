**Story:**

Thought I had a hard time putting on weight. Reasoning being I ate a lot but never gained weight. 

Been to the gym at least two months in a row every year for the past five years. When I say gone to the gym I mean I went inside a gym, picked a muscle group, and found every machine that trains that muscle group and did 3 sets of 12. Never touched a barbell (shit is intimidating). 

Got a new job recently, and most of my co-workers lift. Naturally, this made me want to lift as well. One of them has over 50K followers on his instagram, so I sought his advice. 

Taught me about MyFitnessPal, macros, and the importance of diet. I've heard it all before, but I figured ""If I ate healthy and lifted consistently, I would see results"". 

I was kind of right. Lifting consistently is important, but when you're putting on size you need to EAT SHIT TONS OF FOOD. 

Remember earlier when I said I ate a lot? Yeah, well apparently eating till you're full 2-3 times a day is really only like 2000 calories. 

I told him about my desire to get big (being Asian, I just assumed genetics). He says ""3500 calories a day. 50/30/20 carbs/protein/fat"" 

Calculating it out puts me at 438g carbs/263g protein/78g of fat a day. It was fucking difficult and for the first week I felt slow, fat, and defeated. But I did it. I ate every 90 minutes like it was my job. My grocery bill was enormous, and meal prepping became meditative. I cut out sugar in this time and all processed foods. On week 2, I felt like a machine. I progressed so quickly (thank you noob gains). 

Anyways... Tonight marks 2 months into my journey and I felt really good after my workout so I decided to take an after pic. My lifts went up every week but it wasn't until I compared the pictures that it really struck me. I got a lot of information from him, but every day I drew inspiration from /r/fitness. 

Thanks guys. At the end of the day, it's all about putting in the work. Well, and being humble. Victim mentality never got anybody anywhere. I'll be bulking until I plateau then cutting. I think I'll be happy once I hit the 1k club.
