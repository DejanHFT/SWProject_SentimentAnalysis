How to foster creativity (during pandemic!),Brilliant-Spend-2083,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/mwqiwg/how_to_foster_creativity_during_pandemic/,2,19,"Hi all,

It can be extremely difficult to be creative and focus during a pandemic. Luckily, I have learned to manage it over time and nowadays I feel more productive. Here some tips which I think you might benefit from.

**Create the right environment**

I have a clean desk with minimum distractions. I love music of any kind, but I prefer chill hip hop or techno playlists (love to click with rhythm☺). And scents, lavender kinds of smells always help me to relax.

**Set task limits**

Dreadful deadlines become my best friend. I set a time limit for every work I do and give 50 minutes to any task I need to do. By allocating 50 minutes, I condition my brain to complete my work in 50 minutes.

**Take quality breaks**

I used to find my best ideas on breaks. So, I started to do it systematically. After 50 mins of work, I stop and do:

* Breathing exercises – inhale 4 seconds, hold it 7 seconds, and exhale 7 seconds.
* Meditate – I use **Medito** for this one.
* Walking around and get some fresh air

**Working with other people**

When you work with other people, seeing them working hard makes you feel kind of guilty when you are not working. I use **Dive** for this and it also helped me to set limits on my tasks and take breaks.

**Dive**: Video conferencing tool which matches you with random people and put you 50 mins
