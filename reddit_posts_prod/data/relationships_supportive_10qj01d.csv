Making new supportive friendships in adulthood (F25),taromilktea___,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10qj01d/making_new_supportive_friendships_in_adulthood_f25/,23,1,"I’m beginning to face the reality that I have lost my old high school friendships and it’s time to move on. I’m in my mid twenties and feeling incredibly lonely.

Firstly, I’m not interested in comments telling me to “put myself out there” - because I have been for several months now. I started a new job, I’ve been volunteering, reaching out to old friends or to people I had lost touch with, doing exercise classes, joining events through Facebook groups etc. In regards to new people, all I have ended up with is a bunch of acquaintances. I’m not being reserved, I try to make conversation and sometimes ask if we can connect through social media. In regards to old / distant friends, I find that I’m always the one organising and reaching out, and that when we do catch up I’m confronted with the reason why we were never that close (it’s difficult to connect in a meaningful way and the conversation usually remains very superficial). 

TLDR: I don’t want a list of more things I should be doing, what I want to hear is real, tangible stories of how people made new friendships and circles in their adult lives. And why you think those friendships worked out."
