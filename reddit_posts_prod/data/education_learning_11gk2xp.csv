I'm a university student looking to learn about the processes and systems behind bell scheduling in 6th-12 grade schools. Who can I talk to/where can I look to learn more?,scheduled_nightmare,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/11gk2xp/im_a_university_student_looking_to_learn_about/,12,4,"When I was in high school, I built a small tool to help solve some problems/inefficiencies I saw regarding bell schedule distribution. I now have an opportunity to pursue this idea a little further and earn some course credit for it and I'm looking to see if there is anyone who i could talk to to learn more about  the bell scheduling processes (i.e. how schedules are made and communicated) at 6th-12th grade schools beyond my own.

Is there somewhere in particular I can go to find people who are familiar with this topic from a variety of schools (beyond just my own high school connections) that are likely to be willing to talk with me?"
