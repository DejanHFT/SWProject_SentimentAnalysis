How to suggest my employer to offer a gym membership/wellness program benefits?,wildkilliams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/vb8kq/how_to_suggest_my_employer_to_offer_a_gym/,1,0,"If you're unfamiliar with what I am asking, some employers offer to pay part or all of an employees gym membership. All you have to do is bring in the gym membership bill/contract and the money is added to your paycheck. In return for offering this program, employers can qualify for discounted health insurance rates and possibly pay lower taxes. My previous employer had a program and it was awesome. At my current job, the company frequently holds competitions like their own version of ""The Biggest Loser"" so I know there is some interest in it.    

I would like to suggest a program to the HR manager, but have never done anything like this so I don't want to come off as an idiot. I would really appreciate if anyone has advice/experience with this."
