"Weight loss isn't rocket science, it's just a pain in the ass.  More importantly, anyone can achieve it.",MorningNapalm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/c5d6h/weight_loss_isnt_rocket_science_its_just_a_pain/,183,110,"A question that shows up with almost clockwork regularity on Fittit is a question about weight loss.  People either want to lose weight because they feel they are overweight or there are those who train and desire the 'ripped' look.  I'm here to tell you that **weight loss isn't rocket science, it's just a pain in the ass.**

A simple BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) Calculator will provide you with an idea of the calories you burn per day just being alive.  [Here](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/) is one such simple iteration, although there are many more in-depth ones available on the interwebs if you have the patience to look.  Take that number and add to it the calories you burn during exercise (average it for a week) [this is a good reference list](http://www.nutristrategy.com/activitylist.htm) although there are many more. The number you have now is the number of calories you need to eat if you want to stay the same weight.

Now comes the complicated part:

    If you want to lose weight eat less, if you want to gain weight eat more.

Not rocket science I don't think.

Now, the next important part has to do specifically with what you eat.  Not all calories are created equal, if you're eating garbage (fast anything) and cutting calories you probably won't lose weight as fast as you want and you will **definitely** feel like crap while you're trying.

What you need to do is eat 'real' or 'whole' foods.  Things that are purchased at the grocery store that need to be cooked.  Think Fruits, Vegetables and Meat.  No packaged crap, no 5 minute tv dinners, get a chicken breast and throw it on the BBQ, boil some veggies and away you go.  It's really nothing new and it's nothing complicated.

Finally to calculate the calorie intake based on eating whole foods (which don't come with a nutritional value sticker) use [this](http://caloriecount.about.com/) website.  Again if you can't find what you're looking for google it.  The information is out there.

To lose weight Calories Consumed < (Are less than) Calories Burned.

It's really not hard, there are no tricks or easy ways out.  You do a stupid diet for a week and deprive your body of essential nutrients and sure you'll lose weight.  Then when you're off the diet and you start eating again you're body says, ""Fuck you, I'm gonna save all this up now in case you decide to be a moron again and starve me."" The net result is you either stay the same or you gain weight.

Finally there are various ways you can alter the training you do to improve your weight loss.  Interval training (Hard as you can, break and then repeat a bunch of times) seems to be the consensus on the most effective method. If you want to get into specifics on how to train check out [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtRatEywR4) for scientifically backed up information on how to exercise for effective weight loss.

Losing weight is as simple as eating real food and exercising.  It's got to be your lifestyle insofar as you need to order the salad instead of the fries when you eat out and have a PB&J sandwich when you're hungry but too tired to cook instead of getting fast food.  If you stick with it you'll lose weight and it'll stay off, it really is that simple.

Edit: A few points based on the comments:

First and foremost the above information is about as diluted and general as it can possibly be.  You could write (several) books on the specifics of your diet, on low carb and insulin management and a whole host of other specifics on how to lose weight. However the point to remember is that while there are a shit-ton of variables involved (including genetics, health conditions, stress levels) the basic effective rule is eat healthy and eat less calories than you burn.  If you're doing this and you aren't losing weight (after 2 months of strictly sticking to your diet and exercise plan) then there's probably a medical condition, however this is in the EXTREME minority of cases.  **Most people just aren't honest with themselves about how many calories they consume or how much exercise they're doing.**

Second is that you should be following a 'low carbs' and not a 'no carbs' diet.  Carbs are an important part of body function and eliminating them entirely is detrimental to your health and weight loss efforts.  You should aim for your diet to contain about 30% Carbs, 40% Protein 30% Fat."
