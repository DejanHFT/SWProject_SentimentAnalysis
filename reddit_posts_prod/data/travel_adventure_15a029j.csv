The Ultimate European Rave Adventure,blood91b,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15a029j/the_ultimate_european_rave_adventure/,1,1,"Alright so next year I plan on doing this crazy summer tour of Europe from May-September plus or minus a month or 2. My plan is basically to be in Europe once a month, every month for 1-2 weeks and hit up different countries and cities every month. I love EDM music, house, techno mostly. While I am in those cities I want to hit up major festivals and famous clubs/venues in different places. So for example I know that tomorrowland is in July so i plan of making a week or 2 week trip to Belgium that month and plan around that event. Another month I wanna plan a 2 week trip to ibiza and just go clubbing and experience all the DJ residencies on the island. Yeah I know its gonna be tiring as hell but ill be aight. Ill rest when i die. My question for yall is, Do yall have recommendations on what clubs/venues, cities, countries, and festivals are must-go to while in Europe? If so let me know yall own experiences, ill highly appreciate it. Like I said i wanna be in different places, experiencing different raves/festivals every month for like 6-7 months. Tryna make this a summer to remember when i get old. Year after that is Mexico and South America, and after that shit I dunno. Been all over Asia already.  "
