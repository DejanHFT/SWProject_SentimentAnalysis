What is the oldest evidence we have related to communication?,david_novak,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/9c4dxn/what_is_the_oldest_evidence_we_have_related_to/,6,5,"I'm  thinking about recording mediums like scrolls and stone  tablets...potentially even cave art (which I would classify as a type of  communication medium)...things of the sort. You might not think of  those sorts of things as communication objects or technologies, per se,  but I'm trying to come from a McLuhanesque ""communication as medium""  approach.

​

I'm  aware of some of the biological/anthropology history related to human  abilities to speak, vocalize, etc. but interesting insights are welcome  in that regard as well.

​

I'm  mostly thinking about old anthropological evidence but anything  insights related to ancient books and texts that we have evidence of is  really what I'm after.

​

Cool  stories about the development of more modern technologies welcome as  well if you've got them but I'm thinking beyond more modern  technologies, which I'm a bit better versed in.

Thanks in advance for any cool insights or informative answers and stories!"
