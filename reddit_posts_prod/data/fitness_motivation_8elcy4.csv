Trouple motivating,cacheclear15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8elcy4/trouple_motivating/,20,6,"I've been lifting for about a year and a half. I've increased all my lifts and seen noticeable definition (compared to before anyways lol). At first I wasn't tracking calories, wasn't doing many exercises, and I was just overall stupid. Since then I've tracked my calories and focused on lifting and within a month and a half added 2 inches on my biceps. 

However, I just got a job and balancing that, school, and a social life is a struggle, especially because I have a girlfriend that I can only see on the weekends and end up using most of that time with her.

My motivation to get to the gym has plummeted. I was wondering if anyone here has had any of the same problems and if so could give me some tips to motivate?

Another issue regarding motivation is I'll start my workout motivated, but after 2 or 3 exercises I just feel tired and overwhelmed by the amount I still have left to do. Any tips for this please?? Upping my water intake? Maybe a bigger pre workout? I workout after school and typically don't have time for a pre workout, so there's usually a 4 to 5 hour gap between lunch and then getting to the gym."
