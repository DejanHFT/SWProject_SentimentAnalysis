Most of the Time I don’t get sleep, I have insomnia, but when I do sleep, my dreams are wild, like last night. I had a dream I was a amazing artist student, who was in middle school about to be in high school. The teachers told me that I could create an art project to join a super expensive and cool high school, which was my dream school. At first, I didn’t get in and I had failed and was forced to return to normal school when the teacher who became very fond of me convinced the judges to let me in, and when I was returning to school, he took me out of line and brought me to my new school, but the first day there went terribly wrong. The mythical became real, fusing into our land. Can’t wait to get writing!"
