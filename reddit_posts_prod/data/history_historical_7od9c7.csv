"Historical ""sin cities""?",90_degrees,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7od9c7/historical_sin_cities/,250,386,"I was just wondering; Las Vegas is renowned for being the ""Sin City"", a city with a very high tolerance for many forms of adult entertainment. Now I'm curious: other than probably the largest cities of the world, which cities throughout history have had such a reputation, that could be appropriately tagged ""sin city""?"
