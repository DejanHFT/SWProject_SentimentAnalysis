Unreachable caulking,diynoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/190dr7x/unreachable_caulking/,1,0,"I have some gaps I need to caulk around the ceiling edges. Unfortunately said ceiling is above a deep staircase with a bend in it and no option to use a ladder and is therefore unreachable. 

Any ideas? I can't seem to find an equivalent tool for caulking as for example a paint roller on an extendable pole. Probably because such a tool would need to apply and smooth out, which seems tricky to achieve from a distance. 

Cheers!"
