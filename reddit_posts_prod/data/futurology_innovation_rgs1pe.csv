This is the implication of the commercials about society’s current regard for “innovation”.,Euqinueman2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/rgs1pe/this_is_the_implication_of_the_commercials_about/,3,0,"Sigh.  It will never change for the better.  NEVER!, will it?.  The old idea of the 21st century future has been scrapped!  And replaced with the complete opposite.  It’s such an insufferable spectacle.  Doesn‘t it bother anyone else that society appears to have declared its complete and utter abandonment of interest in and acceptance of the idea of valuing devices because they look cooler and more futuristic and embracing this aesthetic of having cool-looking devices (other than phones!  And not even that.  iPhone!!!)  What do they make it all about instead?  Tacky hideous ridiculously old-fashioned apparel and decor!  It just goes on and on and on endlessly with this complete and utter antithesis to newness, for lack of a better way to describe it.  And that’s what they make it all about!  Making all these ads look like they show scenes from the early 1970s.  So it’s just all about the most un-innovative possible things!  It’s just all about websites and apps to sell mundane things other than innovative devices, and hideous fashion, that’s the best!!!  THAT’s what it’s all about!  NEVER devices anymore!  For shame!  Not only that, it appears society is also completely rejecting IOT from the ads.  Now that may not be the case, but you wouldn’t know it from the ads, because they never say anything, at least hardly whatsoever, about controlling other devices with a smartphone.  All these smart devices I read about over two years ago, and absolutely NOthing about any of them!  All these many smart home companies that can’t make one single commercial, or even internet still image ad!  OUT OF THE QUESTION, TOTALLY, for them to advertise their own product AND tout that it looks cooler/ more futuristic as a reason to choose it over similar devices!  And they also couldn’t even talk about any innovative functionality of it.  Just look at Facebook’s ads for Portal.  How many have they done now?  And never ONCE have they mentioned that it features Alexa!!!  All they do is show it as a videophone!  It has all these very innovative capabilities, but they can NEVER talk about them, can’t even say Alexa.  Ad after ad where it’s just a videophone!  And what about Echo Show?  Don’t say it’s cool!  No no no!  Just show it as a music player that plays old music for the elderly, not that there’s anything wrong with that and no offense, but how can I not mention that in regard to this, make of it what you will.  You see what I mean?"
