Social Emotional Learning and teaching from a cart,suttonfearce,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/o5otd3/social_emotional_learning_and_teaching_from_a_cart/,21,22,"Hello! I will be teaching SEL next year for the first time as a prep class for K-8 and will be teaching from a cart. Any advice what I should have on my carts and some pros and cons for this curriculum? 

I have a great relationship with my students but I’m nervous about teaching SEL without a background in it. I have been teaching theatre and while identifying emotions and learning to express them in that way, I’m not sure how prepared I will be in two months in this endeavor. In addition, how will this class potentially affect my emotional well being? 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

EDIT: Forgot to add that I’ll be using LionsQuest curriculum"
