**Critics concensus**:  An ambitious, over-the-top zombie heist mashup, Army of the Dead brings Zack Snyder back to his genre roots with a suitably gory splash.

Publication (score)  

Daily Telegraph 4/5
> Everyone here has been cast for their faces, not their names - and Snyder's camera examines the toll taken by the heist on each one of them closely, most of all Bautista's, which remains one of the most soulful in modern Hollywood.   

Washington post 2/4  
> I like zombie movies as much as the next guy, but let's be honest: There's filler here.   

Chicago sun 3/4  
>  Essentially a standard-issue zombie movie, albeit an extremely well-executed entry in the genre...   

Tribune news 3/4  
> An evolution of and homage to his first feature, with direct references and a return to its snarky and cynical tone. Much like ""Dawn,"" ""Army of the Dead"" is sarcastic, funny, shockingly bloody and almost unbearably bleak.   

Time out 2/5  
> Army of the Dead resembles nothing so much as a watered-down Aliens with slot machines.   
 
Independent 3/5  
> A Baroque tapestry of blood, bullets and bones - one that's never short of memorable imagery, even if its symbolism is so obvious that it feels like it's been screamed through a megaphone.   

Comicbook movie 3.5/5  
> Zack Snyder makes zombies cool again in Army of the Dead, but falls into bad habits along the way. Dave Bautista, however, steals the show, and the movie is fun, dumb, and wacky enough to make this a franchise we hope to sink our teeth into again.   

Rolling stone 2.5/5  
> It's a good enough formula, with the makings of a solid piece of pop confection -- and that's basically what Snyder delivers.
