New House vs New Job & City…the trials and tribulations of trying to be a supportive spouse,Stargazing-007,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nliih1/new_house_vs_new_job_citythe_trials_and/,30,29,"My husband was offered a position that he really wants with a great company. The only issue: they want us to relocate. 

Let me start over. We just moved into our house about 3 weeks ago. My husband was in talks about the role for nearly 2 months and knew there was a chance relo would be required but there was also a possibility of remote work. He let them know we were planning on moving and really needed to know their decision. The Company kept saying they were still in their interview phase. 

With a very competitive housing market, we decided not to chance it and took the house. After the first week in the new house, the Company called to tell him the position he was interviewing for was put on hold but, they wanted to put him in front of other hiring managers for a different job. Well, they did and they loved him. Now this job is located in another state and requires us to move. Also, the job asks for 80% travel. 

I guess what I’d like to know is, is it unreasonable to request a remote role if he’ll be traveling 80% anyways? I’m trying to be supportive but I really don’t want to move. (I have roots here.) 

What would you do?

TL;DR! Husband has a new job offer in a new city with 80% travel but we just bought a dream house.

UPDATE: After talking to the Company and explaining the situation with the house and how much we would lose, they’re allowing my husband to stay!!! Thank you all for your insights and support. I really appreciate you!"
