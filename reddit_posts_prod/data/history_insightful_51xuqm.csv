Why is Hitler often depicted as the most evil dictator of all time?,SosaCorleone,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/51xuqm/why_is_hitler_often_depicted_as_the_most_evil/,531,669,"I always see Hitler being portrayed as the most evil dictator in history, while he did kill approx. 11 million people, there are other people who have committed similar or even worse acts of genocide and terror. Why are people like Stalin, Mao Ze Dong or Genghis Khan always in the shadows when it comes to brutal leadership. While for many of us we know about the horrors due to our further reading about history, a lot of ordinary people would often view Hitler as the worst criminal of history due to him being portrayed as the most evil villain. So referring back to the question, is it due to Hitler's approach in killing people due to the horrendous nature of concentration camps and gassing? Please provide an insight, thanks in advance.  "
