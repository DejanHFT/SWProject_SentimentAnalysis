I [31M] feel that my girlfriend [23F] isn't quite supportive enough,TruthSeeker402,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cl6clx/i_31m_feel_that_my_girlfriend_23f_isnt_quite/,62,137," I am a black man living in Asia. My girlfriend \[23F\] is Asian. We have been dating for about 5 months.  Our relationship is generally good but as with many relationships we face a lot of racism.

I often get comments like ""why don't you stick with your own"" especially from single East Asian men who have trouble finding dates.

It doesn't end there. I've even received death threats and was evicted from my apartment simply for dating an Asian woman. My GF has been kind enough to let me stay with her and although her parents weren't comfortable at first they have had to accept it.

But sometimes when I say these things to my GF she is simply saying ""don't let it get to you"" or ""I'm sure people don't mean to be racist"".

No. It doesn't matter if you don't mean to be racist. Telling me ""Go back where you came from"" or ""Stick with your own"" IS racist.

Let's put it this way:

If you step on my foot, you need to get off my foot.

If you step on my foot without meaning to, you need to get off my foot.

If you step on my foot without realizing it, you need to get off my foot.

If everyone in your culture steps on feet, your culture is horrible, and you need to get off my foot..

Yes simply saying that they don't mean to be racist is like saying that they don't mean to step on my feet. It is not excusable.

TLDR: In an inter-racial relationship and my GF keeps brushing off racism."
