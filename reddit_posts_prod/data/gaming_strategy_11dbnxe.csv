Which is the best 2022 Square Enix Strategy game?,atavaxagn,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11dbnxe/which_is_the_best_2022_square_enix_strategy_game/,7,4,"for whatever reason Square Enix decided to launch 3 strategy games last fall.  TRIANGLE STRATEGY,   Tactics Ogre: Reborn , and  The DioField Chronicle. Unfortunately they're all $50-$60 so, I don't really want to buy more than one. Any tips for choosing which one? Or even just what are the major differences between them?"
