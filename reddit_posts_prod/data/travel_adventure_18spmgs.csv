G adventures packing,Kallymouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18spmgs/g_adventures_packing/,2,1,"So I'm planning to Vietnam via G adventures in January. I'm wondering if anyone has experience with G Adventures? I want to pack a hardcase luggage (22""x14""x9"") and a backpack. Will I be able to leave the hardcase luggage in the hostel or bus while we're out doing excursions? Or would I have to carry it with me everywhere? Alternatively, should I one bag it with a larger backpack?"
