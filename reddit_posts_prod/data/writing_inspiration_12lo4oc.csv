Is it ok to take inspiration from other franchises for your book?,ApfleJuice,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/12lo4oc/is_it_ok_to_take_inspiration_from_other/,86,86,"Hi there, I've tried looking it up and I can't really get a clear answer.   
I am currently writing a fantasy novel I intend to publish and as the subject implies, I've taken some inspiration from the Elder Scrolls & Dragon Age franchise, however I have twisted those ideas so they would be unique to me. And as silly as that is to ask, is that fine? Again I 100% intend to make sure it is unique to me when executed, as unique you can be in a world of 8 billion people I imagine lol. I just don't want to get copyrighted or anything scary like that so I thought I would ask! And thanks for your help <3"
