r/philosophy can you please help me out. I really do need your help,tstartl,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/lqv03/rphilosophy_can_you_please_help_me_out_i_really/,30,13,"Let me give you the entire story:
This past summer i did quite a bit of psychedelics (mushrooms and lsd) this got me moving towards seriously contemplating about existence. I started reading a lot of philosophy and I have, at the same time, been taking neuroscience classes at my university. 

My first bad trip happened the last day before school started when i looked at my idea of existence from an outside prespective and realized how i had no idea what the fuck is going on in this universe. I overcam that feeling and pushed this idea that nobody knows what the hell is going on, but that we are all pieces of dna struggling to survive and that I was born very very fucking lucky: genetically gifted (as a bio major i know how frequesnt mutations  and genetic diseases are), intellectually gifted, and economically gifted. This gave me a drive to be the best person i can be and help others, who were not born with the opportunities that i was, as much as i can.

The other day i got really really high, and started questioning everything. My dad worked at a psych hospital and he would tell me stories about people who just ""snapped"". (one story that resonated with me was a man who just finished medical school and was on his way to a promising job, and one day he took a walk. and he kept walking. he didnt stop until two states down where a cop found him with bloody feet because he had been walking non stop and the soles of his shoes had worn off.)
I started questioning why i don't just do these things. It clicked to me that right and wrong, good and evil where just human concepts. The concept of the Joker from the Dark Night hit me. The same way i wanted to help the world there where people who wanted to destroy the world (or 'watch the world burn') who is to say what I want is right and what they want is wrong? 

I felt like i was going insane. Everything that i know is this fake societal construct, why should i follow anything? I was really really scared i was going insane. I couldnt give myself a reason not to just keep walking like that one guy. I couldnt sleep and eat at all for two days.

This was all about two weeks ago, and i have since talked myself out of most of that panic and despair feeling (which i will certainly tell you about, but i want to hear your thoughts first). However, I still get this panic feeling if i think too much now. I have been avoiding any serious thought into philosophy, physics, and neuroscience because it honestly scares me. it just seems like this deep void that i no longer want to venture into. Even if i think about things like depth, time, and space it freaks me out, and i just prefer not to. 

has anyone else felt this way? what did you do about it? I want to get back into learning these abstract ideas, but i am honestly scared. is there anything I can do to overcome this?

also, i am done doing drugs. They where amazing as they gave me a completely new and beautiful prespective on everything life is, but i also realize how fragile reality is and i no longer want to fuck with it."
