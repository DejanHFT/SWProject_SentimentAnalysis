Is literary fiction really dead?,awalkattwilight,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/175kwzg/is_literary_fiction_really_dead/,172,132,"Dan Sinykin, in his opinion piece [""What was literary fiction?""](https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/what-was-literary-fiction/) (The Nation), argues that literary fiction is no more, and that the common interpretation of what it includes became too loose and distorted from its original meaning to mean anything today.

I found the article interesting, albeit too light on the reasons why this genre would be considered dead. His main focus is on Amazon's referencing method, but I don't think it makes a lot of sense to take a private corporation as a point of reference, regardless of how big it is in the book market. If literary fiction is a 'dialectic between art and entertainment', and if a book does not, in one way or another, align with this definition, then it is simply missclassified. Reputable booksellers, not overly relying on algorithms, would probably classify that book under a different category.

What do people in this sub think of Sinykin's stance? 

Also curious to know about your favorite books that fit within this category!"
