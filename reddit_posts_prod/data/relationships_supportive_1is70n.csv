Me[38M] Having issues with parents [63M/62F] not being supportive of my daughter [6F],nalox1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1is70n/me38m_having_issues_with_parents_63m62f_not_being/,35,71,"About 5 years ago I met someone. That someone had a daughter. She was one-year-old at the time. We fell in love and try as I might I fell in love with her daughter as well and became a dad for the second time in my life. I have an older daughter and she fell in love as well with her new sister. They were bonded tight even though there was no blood shared between them. As it is in some love stories it did not last happily ever after, and we broke up after 3 years together. I have maintained a friendship with my ex and I still have a daughter. I see her almost everyday and she spends just as much time with me as she does her mother.  It has been 5 summers since that time and every summer my oldest, 18 now, always asks to have her sister stay with us while she is here. It is a request that I grant easily. Ever since my break up my parents have been less than supportive of my decision to keep up my father status with her. My father even says that I have no wife and children and should be off to the far flung reaches of the world. My mother has looked down her nose at my youngest ever since we broke up. I am the only daddy that this child knows plain and simple. 

Today my oldest daughter comes to me in tears and hands me her phone and shows me a text that my dad sent her.  He said and I am paraphrasing here. “Don’t tell your dad but you are not ******’s babysitter. It’s bullshit that she leaves her with him all the time so she can go fuck her boyfriend.” I was outraged. What is he thinking? Did he really expect her not to tell me what he said? And not to mention my oldest asked for her to stay. She loves her sister and they both look forward to this time every year. I don’t know why they can’t accept her as I do. I don’t know how to tackle this issue with my parents with out it becoming a huge fight. 


**tl;dr**: Parents being dicks about me still being a dad to my exes 6 year old daughter."
