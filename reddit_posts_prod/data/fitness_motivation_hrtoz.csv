Is it weird that HATE motivates me?,MyHairyLegs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/hrtoz/is_it_weird_that_hate_motivates_me/,56,30,"So I started my fitness journey 3 days ago. I did some mild workouts before but never this serious.
My diet and running is very motivated by my hate of my Ex's.
When im running and feel like stopping I say ""No keep going, get fit, look good again, throw it in your ex's face and friends face""
and when i feel like straying from my diet ""No you cant eat that, thats what they want you to do, fuck them!!""
Not just my ex's but me and friends are mean to eacho ther and now that i gained some weight they also point it out.
I dont hate them I love them but i want to throw it their face when i lose it. 

Is this bad? Should i be motivated by other things instead of spite?

First post to Fitit, just want to thank you guys for all the helpful lurking.

*EDIT
Thanks for all the replies guys. I guess its fine if it helps now but I shouldn't rely on it. Il try and use other things to motivate me soon. mmmm maybe the after picture? that i can shove down there throats? no no..still hate...this is hard
