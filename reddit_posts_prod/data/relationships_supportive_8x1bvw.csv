My cousin (23M) ruins every party he’s at and expects me (21F) to be his social support.,lovelyregressions,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8x1bvw/my_cousin_23m_ruins_every_party_hes_at_and/,76,1143,"My cousin, fiancé (21M) and brother (19M) all go to the same university in our state. I just graduated from a different university and will be going to theirs to do a masters program while my fiancé finishes up his undergrad. We’ve been long distance since high school and fiancé is in the marching band there. This is a party school and the band does their fair share. Whenever I would visit, we would have a party we could go to. 

Cousin is also in the band, but he is not well liked, because he is pretty obsessive and rude. He literally calls himself by the instrument he plays. This is fine, like what you like. But he called one girl a whore to her face and openly talks about how he hates others in the band. 
He is also noticeably insecure about a lot of things, which I think is part of why he’s lashing out. He is very obese, despite their conditioning and everything. He has switched his major three times to avoid a certain math class (essentially college algebra). 

The main issue is, whenever he’s at a party he drinks essentially a whole case of beer by himself, gets drunk and starts screaming about nonsense. If he sees me he acts like we’re best buddies but if I don’t spend every moment with him he follows me around, threatens to tell my parents I’m drinking and accuses me of doing drugs. He texted me one time after leaving a party “fuck you you rat bastard”. He is also always mad if he sees I’ve visited my bf without telling him I was in town. It just is leaving me drained and I haven’t been to party where he’s there since. He has also started trying to party with my younger brother too who has just started college and isn’t super comfortable with the whole party scene yet.

I talked to my parents about his drinking and behavior and they’re essentially like “yep that sounds like [cousin’s name]”. I’m really not sure what to do. It’s not my responsibility to make him lose weight or be a better person but how do I enjoy my time during my masters while he is also there.

TLDR: Cousin is rude and insecure and wants me to be his best friend whenever I visit him but lashes out if I show any disinterest."
