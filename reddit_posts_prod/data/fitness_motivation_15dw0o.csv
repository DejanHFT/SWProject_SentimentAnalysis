Motivation to begin working out again,ElevenSleven,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/15dw0o/motivation_to_begin_working_out_again/,38,3,"Hey r/fitness

Background: I was originally 6' 150 lb going into first yr university. I was incredibly skinny and lanky. Fresh off a long and terrible breakup I decided it was time to begin working out. By second year I was around 165 lbs and in great shape. Working out three times a week and doing something physically active every day. By the end of second year I was 175 and in the best shape i had ever been in. My housemates I lived with smoked pot and I did as well. It produced the same great feeling I would get after workouts, flooding the body with endorphins. By the end of third year I was down to 160 and then at the start of fourth year I was down to 155, my endurance and cardio completely destroyed.

I need help finding the motivation to begin working out again, I currently play squash, intramural hockey and inner tube water polo but I struggle to continue to lift weights. Any suggestions?"
