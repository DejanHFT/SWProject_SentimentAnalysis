My (25MtF) partner (24F) was just diagnosed w/ Bipolar 2 and is depressed. How to get through her being distant and numb while being supportive?,nahnahnapoopoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15mmwd2/my_25mtf_partner_24f_was_just_diagnosed_w_bipolar/,0,1,"Hi! I’m offering my partner as much support as I can, but it seems I keep making her more uncomfortable. Everything is making her feel bad right and now and she describes herself as numb. She has become irritable and distant in a matter of days and I miss her like hell. I miss the affection and love. I feel like I’m grieving the loss of our relationship already and it came so suddenly, but I know she’s just depressed. This has happened before and she came back around. This time I encouraged her to see a doctor and he diagnosed her with Bipolar 2 and said she is having a depressive episode. She was prescribed abilify 2 mg for 3 or 4 days and started 5 mg abilify yesterday. She is also starting therapy soon. 

The thing is, I have Bipolar type 1, but I’ve been getting help for over a decade now and can faire the troubled waters of my own mental health fairly well all things considered. She is new to this and to add to her depression, she is scared and confused and resents that she is now labeled bipolar.

Tl;dr How do I cope with the distance from my bipolar partner’s depression and how do I support her while maintaining stability for us even when she becomes irritable or upset?"
