Greece guided tours: Contiki vs G adventures versus EF for 27f?,kaitlyn345,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17n8kwz/greece_guided_tours_contiki_vs_g_adventures/,5,0,"Hello, 
I would really like to go to Greece this coming summer, but am a solo female traveler in New England USA. 
 I don’t want to go alone, but I worry about doing a tour guide agency for a trip and getting scammed or some such (this is my first time looking to book a tour guide agency). 

My hope is to really do a historical tour in Athens, and then do a little bit of enjoying Santorini, and maybe Mykonos. 

Can any young solo female travelers share their experience? I am okay with paying more to know that I’m not going to get scammed lol. :) 
Thanks!"
