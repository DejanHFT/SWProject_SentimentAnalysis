Strategies For Achieving 10% Body Fat and Pushing Through a Plateau,Bonzai_Monkey,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/tf0rpt/strategies_for_achieving_10_body_fat_and_pushing/,108,0,"#  Context:

I am trying to get to 10% body fat for the first time. It's been proving pretty difficult, but one thing has more or less helped me through the entire process-- understanding caloric deficit. I've been trying to keep myself in a caloric deficit for a while now, but I've run into a problem. I'm at just under 12% bodyfat, eating roughly 1300 calories per day, and plateauing. I understand that reaching a goal such as 10% body fat requires strict dietary requirements, but from what I've seen, other people can achieve the same goal, all the while eating more calories.

I tried to look online just to get a general idea of how many calories other people were eating to reach the same milestone, only to not be able to find any numerical answer. The best I could do was brief mentions from fitness YouTubers where they would say roughly 1800\~2000 calories, which is substantially more than I am currently intaking. I am primarily interested in developing an understanding of what is *generally* normal caloric intake for those trying to reach certain body fat goals, because there seems to not be a clear consensus; I understand full well that it varies from individual to individual, so to reiterate, I'm just trying to create a range so as to establish normalcy.

It is my hope to learn and improve my own diet, and for this post to help others do so as well.

# Details on me, if you want a better picture:

* 5'8""
* Male
* 19 Years old, almost 20
* Substantial muscular development (could pass as a Marvel Hero)
* Currently at 11.9% body fat (using an electric scale)
* Between 158 and 160 lbs (fluctuates, just wanted to give a good idea)

# Typical diet consists of:

* Supplements, including: amino acid pills, fish oils for omega-3s, zinc, selenium, and multivitamin gummies (Don't judge me, I like what I like), **70 calories**
* 1/2 cup of oatmeal + scoop of protein (**25g protein**) + 1 tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder, **300 calories**
* Caffeinated coffee, 1/3 cup almond milk (unsweetened) + 3 packets of Splenda, **20 calories**
* Post workout protein shake, 1 scoop protein (**25g protein**) + 1 scoop of creatine + 1 table spoon of unsweetened cocoa powder, **150 calories**
* 5 ounces of chicken breast, twice a day. To be safe, I round up to 50 calories an ounce. I do this because I marinate the chicken, and use a bit of olive oil and a bit of sauce in the marinade. 50x5x2 = **500 calories, 90 grams of protein**
* Single Drumstick brand ice cream cone (I know that ice cream isn't healthy, but considering how few calories I otherwise eat in the day, I figured it was acceptable, especially considering how it helps prevent me from splurging and, consequently, backtracking). Roughly **290 calories**
* 4 cans of diet soda a day, 2 of which are caffeinated. While claiming zero calories, it is said by some that they actually have roughly 1 calorie per can, so **4 negligible calories**
* Every so often, a cup of decaf coffee as well + 1/3 cup almond milk + 3-4 Splenda packets, **20 calories**
* Grand whopping total of **1334-1354 calories per day, and 140 grams of protein**

# Exercise:

* Weightlifting 6 days a week; in the gym for about an hour each workout, so 6ish hours a week. I don't do cardio as I hear it can prevent muscle growth, and even cause muscular dystrophy, as well as increase hunger. 

# Timeline:

* I've been dieting since January, and have been lifting since February of last year. 

What am I doing wrong, that I should improve on?"
