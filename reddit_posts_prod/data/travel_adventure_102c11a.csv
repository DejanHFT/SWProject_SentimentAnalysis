Italian Adventure,Purple-Lingonberry41,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/102c11a/italian_adventure/,12,1,"My husband and i are going to a wedding the weekend of may 27 in Porto cervo, Sardinia. We want to do a 2 week stay in Italy. We have never been before and planning this trip is pretty intimidating. So as of now, the only plans we know for sure are flying into olbia the 25th and flying out the 29th. No idea where to go from here :) all i know is I want to spend a lot of time in rome.
So i was hoping you all could help me fill 2 weeks time for an amazing Italian vacation.

How many cities should we visit?
What route should we take?"
