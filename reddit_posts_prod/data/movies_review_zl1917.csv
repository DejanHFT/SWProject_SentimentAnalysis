'Avatar: The Way of Water' Review Thread,SanderSo47,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/zl1917/avatar_the_way_of_water_review_thread/,2393,4138,"[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avatar_the_way_of_water): 84% (143 reviews) with 7.30 in average rating

> Critics consensus: Narratively, it might be fairly standard stuff -- but visually speaking, *Avatar: The Way of Water* is a stunningly immersive experience. 

[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/avatar-the-way-of-water): 69/100 (47 critics)

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** 

> Even more than its predecessor, this is a work that successfully marries technology with imagination and meticulous contributions from every craft department. But ultimately, it’s the sincerity of Cameron’s belief in this fantastical world he’s created that makes it memorable.

-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/avatar-the-way-of-water-james-cameron-equel-1235279758/)

> Does it matter if “The Way of Water” doesn’t elicit the same response when I watch it at home? Not really — I know that it won’t. Does it matter that Cameron is continuing to “save” the movies by rendering them almost unrecognizable from the rest of the medium? His latest sequel would suggest that even the most alien bodies can serve as proper vessels for the spirits we hold sacred. For now, the only thing that matters is that after 13 years of being a punchline, “going back to Pandora” just became the best deal on Earth for the price of a movie ticket.

-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/12/avatar-2-the-way-of-water-review-1234791247/): A-

> Evoking that movie (Titanic) is a tactical mistake, because it reminds you that “Titanic” was a jaw-dropping spectacle with characters who touched us to the core. I’m sorry, but as I watched “The Way of Water” the only part of me that was moved was my eyeballs.

-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2022/film/reviews/avatar-the-way-of-water-review-james-cameron-zoe-saldana-sam-worthington-1235451995/)

> By the time it crests, whatever the film’s many other flaws may be, we are invested, and we are ultimately rewarded with a truly spectacular, awe-inspiring finale. All’s well that ends well, I guess. Even if all was a pretty mixed bag beforehand.

-[William Bibbiani, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/avatar-the-way-of-water-review-james-cameron/)

> Avatar: The Way of Water is a thoughtful, sumptuous return to Pandora, one which fleshes out both the mythology established in the first film and the Sully family’s place therein. It may not be the best sequel James Cameron has ever made (which is a very high bar), but it’s easily the clearest improvement on the film that preceded it. The oceans of Pandora see lightning striking in the same place twice, expanding the visual language the franchise has to work with in beautiful fashion. The simple story may leave you crying “cliché,” but as a vehicle for transporting you to another world, it’s good enough to do the job. This is nothing short of a good old-fashioned Cameron blockbuster, full of filmmaking spectacle and heart, and an easy recommendation for anyone looking to escape to another world for a three-hour adventure.

-[Tom Jorgensen, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-way-of-the-water-review): 8.0 ""great""

> James Cameron has surfaced with a cosmic marine epic that only he could make: eccentric, soulful, joyous, dark and very, very blue. Yes, he’s still leagues ahead of the pack.

-[Nick De Semlyen, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/avatar-the-way-of-water/): 5/5

> The whole package here is so ambitious, yet intimate and gently tempered in its quieter moments, that it feels heartening to be reminded of what a big-budget Hollywood movie can be when it refuses to get crushed under pointless piles of rubble and noise. Confessionally, this critic wishes that Cameron had room in his schedule to put out more than one film in over a decade and original movies in addition to the ones that belong to this big beautiful franchise. Still, it’s significant to have him back with a picture that feels like a theatrical event to be celebrated, nowadays a retro idea occasionally reminded by the likes of Nope and Top Gun: Maverick. These are Cameron’s own waters, and it’s significant to see him effortlessly swim in them again.

-[Tomris Laffly, The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/avatar-the-way-of-water-film-review-james-cameron-1849882442): A

> Maintaining a sense of stakes will be necessary for the series going forward, especially if it plans on rolling out new entries at a quicker pace. But for The Way of Water, the decadence is more than enough—for cinemas that have been starved of authentic spectacle, finally, here’s a gorgeous three-course meal of it.

-[David Sims, The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/12/avatar-2-way-of-water-movie-review-james-cameron/672448/)

> While Cameron is a master of franchise sequels, “Way of Water” doesn’t measure up to his classics, “Aliens” and “Terminator 2: Judgment Day.” But thanks to new personalities and vivid wildlife, on the whole, this latest trip does prove, perhaps surprisingly to some after such a long period between movies, that there’s still some gas in the “Avatar” tank after all.

-[Brian Truitt, USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/12/13/avatar-way-of-water-movie-review-james-cameron/10881944002/): 3/4

> And what do we find aside from the high-tech visual superstructure? The floatingly bland plot is like a children’s story without the humour; a YA story without the emotional wound; an action thriller without the hard edge of real excitement.

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/13/avatar-the-way-of-water-review-james-cameron): 2/5

> Will it end up making $2 billion, as Cameron claims it must in order to inch into profit? With a Chinese release date secured, it may, though I suspect British audiences will find their patience tested. For all its world-building sprawl, The Way of Water is a horizon-narrowing experience – the sad sight of a great filmmaker reversing up a creative cul-de-sac.

-[Robbie Collin, The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/avatar-way-water-review-james-camerons-sequel-like-waterboarded/): 1/5

> The movie's overt themes of familial love and loss, its impassioned indictments of military colonialism and climate destruction, are like a meaty hand grabbing your collar; it works because they work it.

-[Leah Greenblatt, Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movies/movie-reviews/avatar-the-way-of-water-review-james-cameron/): A-

> For all the genuine thrills provided by its pioneering pageantry, Way of Water ultimately leaves you with a soul-nagging query: What price entertainment?

-[Keith Uhlich, Slant Magazine](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/avatar-the-way-of-water-review-james-cameron/): 3/4

> If I had two separate categories to judge James Cameron’s motion-capture epic “Avatar: The Way of Water,” I’d give it four stars for Visuals and two and a half for Story, and I’m in charge of the math here so I’m awarding three and a half stars to “TWAW” for some of the most dazzling, vibrant and gorgeous images I’ve ever seen on the big screen.

-[Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2022/12/13/23504274/avatar-the-way-of-water-review-sequel-2-james-cameron-pandora): 3.5/4

> There is, really, no one else who does it like Cameron anymore, someone who so (perhaps recklessly) advances filmmaking technology to make manifest the spectacle in his head while staying ever-attentive of antiquated ideals like sentiment and idiosyncrasy. Watching The Way of Water, one rolls their eyes only to realize they’re welling with tears. One stretches and shifts in their seat before accepting, with a resigned and happy plop, that they could watch yet another hour of Cameron’s preservationist epic. Lucky for us—lucky even for the culture, maybe—that at least a few more of those are on their way. 

-[Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/12/avatar-the-way-of-water-review-spectacle-worth-the-wait)

> His meticulous craftsmanship shows in every amazing sequence like that final battle at sea. If the story occasionally seems a bit all over the place, well, there are worse things in the world than a filmmaker throwing every last morsel of creativity into his work. You can’t say The Way of Water doesn’t give you your money’s worth, especially in the visual department. This thing’s got enough eye candy to give you ocular diabetes.

-[Matt Singer, ScreenCrush](https://screencrush.com/avatar-the-way-of-water-review/): 7/10

> Avatar: The Way of Water is both more extravagant and dorkier than Avatar, which was pretty dorky to begin with.

-[Stephanie Zacharek, TIME](https://time.com/6240697/avatar-the-way-of-water-review/)

> Cameron leans all the way into manic mayhem, smash-cutting from one outrageous image to the next. The final act of this movie shows off a freeing attitude he’s never fully embraced before.
