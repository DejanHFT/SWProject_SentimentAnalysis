Best time of year to explore Namibia?,UnAppartementAParis,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/11nr48s/best_time_of_year_to_explore_namibia/,1,4,"I've Googled this question a few times and I see the temperature trends for certain cities and such, but that isn't very helpful for determining when the best weather will be across the country.

I'd like to visit the Namib desert, the Skeleton coast, and a few towns or cities. Is there some particular time of year that would be most suitable for a good combination of ""beautiful"" weather and landscapes and wildlife?"
