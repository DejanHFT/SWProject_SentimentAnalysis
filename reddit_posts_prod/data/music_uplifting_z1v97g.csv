Uplifting songs about getting better,Unbound_Sects,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/z1v97g/uplifting_songs_about_getting_better/,0,1,Are there any bands or styles of music dedicated to psychology or philosophy ? I'm wondering if there are lyrics out there trying to promote positive mental health habits or solving mental health struggles instead of just giving them attention. It just seems like there is a lot of music out there supporting depression and anxiety more than singing about how to cure them. Is this a dumb question ?
