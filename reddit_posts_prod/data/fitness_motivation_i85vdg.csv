Is it true it takes at least 8 weeks of daily exercise and healthy diet change to see health benefits?,Borange81,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/i85vdg/is_it_true_it_takes_at_least_8_weeks_of_daily/,613,2206,"Could this be the reason many people don't last long when they make a news years resolution of getting healthy? Many Americans want INSTANT results, and for them 8 weeks seems like forever. I have a friend who keeps telling me he wants to get in shape but after two weeks he quits he just stops jogging, he can't get over that hump. 

They say there is a hump that comes when you first start training and working out were you lose all motivation I wonder if that is from over training or fatigue from not being used to working out consistently

how does one get past that and fight on? does it take mental strength what is the motivation behind it is it constantly saying you want to get healthy or you want to look good and motivating yourself that way?"
