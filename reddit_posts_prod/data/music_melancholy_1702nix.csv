Damon Albarn. You'll miss him when he calls it a day!!,TidyboyTHFC,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1702nix/damon_albarn_youll_miss_him_when_he_calls_it_a_day/,468,570,"I don't care what type of music you like. Whether you know him as Gorillaz or Blur or Solo stuff. The guy is a musical genius. 

He has stayed at the forefront and relevant for 30 years and made many classic albums. 

He is one of the last proper musicians in the world and should be treated like one. Not just ""Gorillaz"" 

His work with world musicians and shedding light on up and coming artists like Kali uchis by giving her a gorillaz tune for her first album etc and unknowns featured on how projects.

And just being an all around musical god means music will never be the same when he's stopped making music. He's so unappreciated. 

How many musicians can play all the instruments he can and like I said stay relevant and groundbreaking for 30 years? Not many. Most fade and churn out crap for their final years

He still has so much to give music just listen to some of his features too. 

A musical legend"
