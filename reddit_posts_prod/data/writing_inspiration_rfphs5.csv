Inspiration for writing a great character,arkman132,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/rfphs5/inspiration_for_writing_a_great_character/,2,0,"I see that many great characters are inspired by the writings of philosophers. Does anyone have any Philosophers I can read about to be inspired by. Many anything destitute. Kind of a weird request i know but I want to make a good character. That will be all, thank you."
