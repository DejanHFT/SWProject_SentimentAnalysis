How does one take inspiration to its fullest.,sbrisbestpart41,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/158w3zl/how_does_one_take_inspiration_to_its_fullest/,0,1,"Hi guys, i've been writting a Novella lightly based on a personal experience and i really want to inject some of the techniques that Camus uses in The Stranger, The Fall, and The Plague to truly make it fiction. While i can identify how he does it i can't actually tell you what it is. If you guys could explain what it is directly, could you help me out?"
