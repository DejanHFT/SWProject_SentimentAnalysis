How to learn effectively,Gates50,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/16wjggl/how_to_learn_effectively/,3,3,"Hello!

I'm currently serving in the military, and have been juggling around subjects to learn about for college. I've run into a sort of mental block, I feel like I can't learn anymore. I used to love it in school, doing tests, having an understanding and solving problems.

Now, I feel like I can't learn anything, that it all goes in one ear and out the other. Currently, I wanted to learn about space, but I feel completely unable to focus. Same goes for every topic. I'm at a loss on what to learn, and have plenty of time to learn but make up the idea in my head that there is none.

I'm not too sure what the issue is, but thought here would be a good place to start (I don't have any ADHD or any learning disabilities that I'm aware of. I was on an IEP until 6th grade)"
