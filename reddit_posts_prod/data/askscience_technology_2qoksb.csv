"With modern technology, how long would it have taken to crack the Enigma in WWII?",Dandan0005,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2qoksb/with_modern_technology_how_long_would_it_have/,15,63,"Just watched Imitation Game, and it made me wonder how long it would take modern computers to crack the same problem. In the movie they mention that the Enigma machine had 159,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible settings. How long would it take? Days? Minutes? Seconds? "
