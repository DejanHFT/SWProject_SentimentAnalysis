In what strategy game do rivers play the most significant role?,Balfus,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/18s41zj/in_what_strategy_game_do_rivers_play_the_most/,22,0,"Weird question, I know.

In the Civilization series, settling by a river provides economic boosts. In Cities Skylines, rivers provide a means of supplying residents with water and sewage connections, and provide a challenging barrier to transport. In Bannerlord and Total War games, rivers can be used to slow and funnel attackers and make them easy to pick off with ranged weapons.

Maybe there are some small indie games or board games where rivers play an even more central role than what I've described above.

Can anyone recommend any such games?"
