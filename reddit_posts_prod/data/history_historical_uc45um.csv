"Historians and history students of reddit, which historical fiction novels have you read that are historically accurate, or at least authentic?",Heirof_Numenor,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/uc45um/historians_and_history_students_of_reddit_which/,33,9,"I'm trying to find a series of historical fiction novels to get into and, honestly, as a history student myself who places high importance on historical accuracy in media, I have a hard time trying to find a series - or even a stand alone novel - that properly portrays the time period when trying to tell its story.

For example, I read a sample of Conn Iggulden's *The Gates of Rome*, and I could not help but groan when Pompey Magnus, when declaring Caesar an enemy of Rome, referred to Rome's holdings as ""our country."" Plus, as is also the case with his *Hundred Years War* series, his contemporary prose takes you out of the experience, and does not feel like you are witnessing a story taking place in a different time period.

But enough of my rant. Overall, I'm looking for a series that not only has a good plot, but stays true to the time period it is representing. Although I prefer military and political history, I'm open to any time period.

If any of you need more specifics, please let me know. Thanks a lot in advance everyone!

P.S. I've heard good things about Bernard Cornwell's *The Saxon Stories*. Would that be worth checking out?"
