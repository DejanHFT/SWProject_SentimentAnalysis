Patch and paint high sheen wood surface,NeuropsychiatricHam,https://i.redd.it/inknm6q6emac1.jpeg,2,0,"On the right-hand stile of this column, there’s a small patch where the previous owner tried to cover up a nail hole. It’s pretty obvious compared to the highly ”polished” surface around it.

Is it possible to make this completely uniform with a little more sanding and painting? Ordinarily I wouldn’t be afraid of a little touch up, but I can’t imagine being able to achieve that sheen with a brush and some sandpaper. The alternative is to hire a cabinetmaker to refinish the entire surface, probably with an airbrush.

The larger context here is that we want to hang a painting from the large panel, and I want to know how much of a pain it will be to patch and paint it down the road if we ever move.

Thanks, Reddit!"
