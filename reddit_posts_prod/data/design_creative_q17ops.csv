Creative burnout,dedalus14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/q17ops/creative_burnout/,16,45,"Hi Everyone,

First time posting in this community, and i'm not entirely sure it is the appropriate one for this kind of question, but here it is.

I've been working as a graphic designer for almost 8 years, before that i studied at uni to do this and in high school too. Basically Graphic Design is the only trade that i know, and without thinking i'm that brilliant, i'm good enough to be valued at work and do something good.

But there's the but.

I think I got burned out when it comes to work on creative stuff.

Every single time a new project which requires putting together a new design idea, i just bang my head against a wall for hours, and what used to take me 2--3 now it requires 8 (most of it spent walking on the spot, or writing posts like this (i should be working right now)).

I keep thinking of working a different job, something that doesn't require the constant creative effort you need in this job. But this is the only profession i know, and the option of doing just artworking or repetitive taks, as much alluring as it can be, I see it as a dead end professionally.

So, here i am asking:

\- How do you deal with this kind of burnout (if you ever had one)?

\- What do you think are career path where some of the skills can go not wasted?

Hopefully the replies can be useful for everyone struggling with motivation and creativity right now. But anyway, if the post is not suited for the sub, mods feel free to delete it.

Edit: Wow, thanks everyone, i've read all the comments and taking a little bit to reply to them, don't want to rush an answer "
