"Just had my first mango, and it was delicious! But I have some questions.",EquationTAKEN,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/3wllmc/just_had_my_first_mango_and_it_was_delicious_but/,97,220,"What's a good way to cut it? I like to eat fruit and veg as is, so if I want something, I just grab and eat. But the mango was a bit difficult. Obviously there was a pit inside, which was hard as hell, but when I simply cut around it, I got these slabs of skin with a bit of meat in them, so it was messy to eat. Wedges or cubes would have been way better. 

What kind of salad does it go with? Veg salad or fruit salad? It might be obvious, but as they say: ""Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing not to put it in a fruit salad."" Does the same go for mango? 

Do I keep it in the fridge, or at room temperature. 

What's the expiration like? Could I expect it to lie around for at least a week without going bad? 

Thanks in advance for any tips!"
