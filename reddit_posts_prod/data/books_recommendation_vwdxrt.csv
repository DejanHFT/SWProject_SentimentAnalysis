[SPOILER] Pillars of the Earth is the most overhyped disaster of a book you will ever have the misfortune of being recommended.,Maukeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vwdxrt/spoiler_pillars_of_the_earth_is_the_most/,1508,8722,"**Pillars of the Earth** is so bad it redefined for me what it means to be a 1-star book. My previous 1-star fiction books have usually been characterised by appalling laziness from the author in addressing the central themes of the book, for example the way the author of **The Power** sidesteps all cultural issues by having her novel take place mostly in a fictional country, or the conspicuous absence of any reference to internalisation in her book. In the case of **Pillars of the Earth** I believe the author may have written exactly the book he intended, with exactly the techniques, devices and characters he needed to convey the message he wanted. But **sweet Jesus fuck** should he have wanted something else.

This book was bizarrely well received, with a Goodreads rating of over 4.3 after 700,000 ratings, frequent appearances in top book lists in newspapers, a TV miniseries etc etc etc. If you search for PoE on this very /r/books you will find nothing but praise in the top threads. Many positive reviews share some common themes, and I hope to address these points and more to explain why this is literally the most overhyped book of all time.

**Chapter 1**  
I am near-certain that all readers of this book will recognise chapter 1 as being just the stupidest shit they have ever read. The difference between the 1 star reviews and the rest, then, is the extent to which readers are able to forgive this unholy embarrassment. I tried to keep an open mind, but it was not easy. For those who have not read the book, the chapter features our early MC Tom whose wife dies of exposure in childbirth after a gruelling winter on the road. Fortunately a sexy forest girl with massive tits (we'll discuss everyone's massive tits in more detail shortly) fell in love with him fifteen minutes earlier because of his eyes so they have a cheeky shag, he falls in love with her, and the dead ex gets mentioned about once in the rest of the book, all characters apparently happy just to forget she ever existed. There is no merit to this chapter in isolation, and it informs no characters or themes except the theme of weird sex stuff. It is perhaps the single worst passage of fiction I have ever read.

**The weird sex stuff**  
Ken Follett likes massive tits and he wants you to know it. The only author I've read who matches Follett's dedication to publishing his private sexual fascinations is Terry Goodkind, and that is never a favourable comparison. The sex is almost exclusively male - we hear about the volume and buoyancy of each lady's boobs from a range if male perspectives, but female perspectives are largely sexless. It's always boobs - one if the final passages of the book is literally a timeline of the various states that Aliena's boobs have gone through during the course if her life. Follett sincerely felt that this was an important thread to wrap up. But it's not all about massive tits - we can also talk about Jack curing Aliena's rape-induced PTSD with his magic dick, or about Aliena's constant complaints about how hairy she is, or about the number of characters who sexualise the same teen arab girl. There is just a lot of dodgy sex stuff (and a LOT of close-up descriptions of massive tits) that just don't add anything and instead make you feel slightly slimy for having read them.

A genuine quote from a woman *who is being made to choose between staying with her baby or searching Europe for her husband:* ""She imagined meeting Jack again. She visualised his face, smiling at her. They would kiss. She felt a stir of pleasure in her loins. She realised she was getting damp down there at the mere thought of him. She felt embarrassed"". This is blatantly inappropriate to the circumstances, but sadly far from the worst erotica the author offers us. ""She was suddenly possessed by a desire to show him her breasts"" come on dude.

**The characters**  
The characters in this book range from utterly ridiculous to merely poor. Many positive reviews note the quality of the characters, and I genuinely pity these reviewers for the quality of book they are apparently missing out on if PoE represents the upper end of what they expect.

If the book can be said to have a main character then it is Phillip, and Phillip is a Mary Sue in the strongest possible sense, which is to say that the world and characters around him warp their nature to make him look better. Despite his position of authority, no character ever bears a grudge against Phillip - in the rare cases that they deserve to, we get point of view chapters confirming that they forgive him for everything. We never see any circumstance in which Phillip, as a moral authority, has to grapple with moral ambiguity. The closest we get is scenarios where Phillip has to impose church law on the undeserving, but even here it is made  unambiguously clear that he would happily act in line with modern sensibilities if it weren't for his malicious colleagues, meaning he feels more like an anachronistic insert than a real character. We get a scene in which Phillip identifies that mortar takes time to harden, whereas the builders set aside time for superstitious reasons - does Phillip take more naturally to building than his own professional master builders? Perhaps so, because Phillip is divinely perfect.

The primary antagonist is William who is so comically and unrealistically evil that he doesn't even feel threatening because he is so comedically over the top. His scenes include yeeting a baby and talking about how he enjoys torturing because it reminds him of raping women. His mother is also a cartoon villain who rolls around looking evil, speaking in cryptic phrases then crying 'idiots' when her henchmen don't understand what she's talking about. Literally like a bad Disney villain from a spin off TV cartoon.

The rest of the cast get various degrees of poor to mediocre characterisation, but the single key point that I found I kept coming back to was that nothing ever informs anybody's character. I touched on this earlier when I mentioned that Tom forgets his dead wife less than 24 hours after she passes, where you might think that in the hands of a better author a dead wife could be a big character moment. Her dying wish is for him to build the cathedral, and even this doesn't come back except as an afterthought well down the line. Tom's big weakness (and you can tell that each character has all the complexity of a pair of columns labelled 'good traits' and 'bad traits') is his unwillingness to discipline his son, but we never see where this comes from or how it interacts with any other element of his character. It's an artificial 'weakness' that the author performs for us occasionally rather than actual depth. We see this same issue across most other characters - William is terrified of hell but we don't see where this comes from and it never affects his behaviour; at Tom's death Phillip declares Tom was his closest friend, but we never actually saw evidence of this.

Aliena literally announces the end of her character arc. She is standing in a street and loudly declares to nobody some shit like 'Father I am finally free if your oath etc etc'. There is a genuine sense in this book that characterisation should be delivered just by declaring it and calling it development.

**Historical accuracy**  
I am no expert on any period of history, including the setting for this novel, and to give credit where it is due there is a definite sense of authenticity about the building of the cathedral. I was uncertain about the implicit claim that this single town revolutionised a wide range of economic activities through the invention of (among other things) automation and market capitalism, but as I say, I'm no expert. However, I did find some external criticisms of the historical accuracy very convincing, including [this review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/30702791) which notes various inaccuracies ranging from the minor (how women would have worn their hair) to the critical (the nature of religious/common marriage law at the time, which the plot repeatedly hinges on).

**The plot**  
I'm not usually so bothered about the details of the plot to be honest, but with that said I did feel there were some key weaknesses here. First of all, it felt like the plot was essentially episodic - we have a cycle under which the dastardly villains hatch a dastardly scheme, only for Phillip to accidentally find out and cleverly foil the dastardly forces of evil. This ties in to a lot of issues I have raised already - the dastardly plot is often hatched by William's mum who already acts like a bad Disney villain, and this structure further cements this role for her; Phillip finds out about these schemes by accident and is given the undeserved opportunity to fix them thereby rendering him the plot's saviour, but only because the plot warped to allow him this chance - the hallmark of a Mary Sue character. 

I also noted a certain amount of plot recycling going on. The closest we see Phillip get to moral ambiguity is when he is forced by the villainous forces of evil to separate Tom and Ellen - though a PoV chapter from Tom makes it clear that he doesn't blame Phillip. Later, Phillip faces similar turmoil when he is forced by the villainous forces of evil to separate Jack and Aliena - though a PoV chapter from Jack makes it clear that he doesn't blame Phillip.

**Overall**  
Everything about this godforsaken disaster of a book is a mess. It benefits from almost no redeeming features. It's vaguely possible that if you took out the weird sex stuff (thereby halving the size of the book) you might salvage a 2-star novel, but on balance it's easy to feel like the author really wanted to write a weird sex book with a small amount of plot structure. Is it possible that I'm advocating for the removal of the central feature of the novel? Perhaps so.

I genuinely do not understand what people see in this book. I don't understand why all the top threads about it are pouring with adoration. I don't understand why it is one of the highest rated books on Goodreads with one of the largest readerships. I saw a comment on one thread that recommended following up with Lonesome Dove, and this one comment has forever put me off reading Lonesome Dove because I cannot bear the thought of approaching anything that is regarded as remotely comparable to this absolute fiasco. I have nothing more to add other than to say I hope that this review will in some way balance the scales so that some unsuspecting and naive future reader can avoid falling into the same trap that I did."
