"Anyone have experience with cheap mini lathes, for drilling holes in rod ends?",workphlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/15i6i8v/anyone_have_experience_with_cheap_mini_lathes_for/,2,1,"I need to consistently make 8mm holes, 8mm deep in the center of one-side of clear acrylic rod ends [(see example).](https://workphlo.shop/cdn/shop/products/cosmetic-product-photography-1-4-20-plate-light-stand-attachment-clear-800-update_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1673125391) and this is similar to lathing in a wooden dowel.

Do you think a cheap mini lathe like these [$50 ones on amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/LuckyHigh-Machine-Polishing-Milling-Woodworking/dp/B08SW2FHGF/ref=sr_1_6?crid=12USD7F4DDAVD&keywords=mini+lathe&qid=1691169920&sprefix=mini+lath%2Caps%2C615&sr=8-6), would be able to achieve what I am looking for here in your experience?"
