An Egyptian Street food with Indian origins that will fulfill your deepest carby desires. If you ask anyone who's been to Egypt about the dishes they remember most fondly, you'll likely hear Koshari mentioned more than once. It's a unique dish that really encompasses the words comfort food. Not only is Kushari one of the most popular and cheapest street foods in Egypt, but it's also the National Dish of the country.

## What is Koshari

Put simply, [Koshari is carbs on carbs on carbs](https://imgur.com/a/qxxO9LX). It's made from a mixture of rice, pasta and lentils which is served with three different sauces.  It's then topped with spiced chickpeas and crispy fried onions for some textural variation. Now if it sounds like sacrilege to mix rice and pasta, well it probably is, but it's delicious sacrilege and you should try it at least once. Perfectly cooked soft rice is mixed with al dente pasta and fried vermicelli, then lightly spiced brown lentils are added. All together you get a great contrast of textures and flavors. The three sauces that are added are a garlic tomato sauce, a spicy tomato sauce (Shatta), and a spiced garlic and vinegar sauce (Dakka). By controlling the amounts of each sauce you can customize the flavors of the dish to your liking, I'm a big fan of extra Shatta and extra Dakka which makes a delicious bowl of Koshari which is quite spicy and tangy. Finally there's the toppings and they are actually a significant part of the dishes flavor. The lentils are cooked with Cumin and some aromatics to give them a lightly spiced flavor, and the onions are also spiced with Cumin before being fried to a perfect crisp. I'm not a massive fans of chickpeas except when turned into Hummus, but I have got to say these chickpeas are bloody delicious and could be eaten just on their own with some rice, and the crispy onions well apart from having great texture, they end up caramelizing really well when frying, and so they have a sweet cumin flavor which is to die for.

The popularity of Koshari in Egypt is partly due to it's wide availability and cheap price, [a huge bowl of Koshari](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/_rClVy-0xDKf3LDemp-5wNza5uaSi6urOun8bDsh3Zk8R1AWx0G2TTGHyNgzqnD5y7u8wGvPCI3PtoLYHZXaym-DHEMCHBHYRUQ-Otu1XuId) (enough for 2-3 people) costs 15 Egyptian Pounds ($0.80) at some of the bigger chains and historically it used to cost as little as ($0.20). It also has the benefit of primarily being made from dried pulses which helps keep the price down and when you can make something so delicious with just a few ingredients, well it's no surprise it became the Egyptian national dish. Koshari is also commonly made at home, busy parents can make a large batch of it and reheat it throughout the week. I'm a big fan of homemade koshari because I generally feel most of the Koshari chains in Cairo lack the oomph factor, and I find that layering the flavors in the dish really helps them pop. I've stolen this recipe from my mother in law as it's the best I've ever tasted and hopefully when you make it you'll understand why.

## History

The history of Koshari is actually very interesting, you see Koshari is thought to have evolved from the south asian dish [Khichiri or Khichdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khichdi), which is a dish made from lentils and rice cooked together. Khichidi has been around for thousands of years, and the Wikipedia entry mentions ""The Greek king Seleucus during his campaign in India (305-303 BC), mentioned that rice with pulses is very popular among people of the Indian subcontinent."". It also states that Ibn Battuta encountered the dish during his time in India. So how did Khichidi get to Egypt? Well there's two possible theories, firstly the silk road introduced all manner of food and spices from Asia to the Middle East. There's a lot of shared dishes and cooking techniques between the two cultures, so it's not unlikely that the dish may have first come to Egypt via the silk road. The second possible explanation is that it was brought to Egypt by the British when they took control of the country in the early 1900s. The British at the time also controlled India and their troops came from all over the empire, so it's likely that the dish may have spread that way.

Back in the 1900s and until around 1970, there were many different nationalities living in Egypt, it was a popular place for expatriates. Cairo had enclaves of Greeks, Italians, French, Turkish, Syrian and of course British nationals. The story goes that when Khichidi reached italian households, they ended up adding pasta to the Khichidi and thus the Koshari base was born. The sauces were likely taken from other Egyptian dishes and added to Koshari, most Egyptian vegetable dishes have a tomato sauce similar to the koshari one, and the garlic and vinegar mixture is close to the sauce added to Egyptian Fattah. 

## Flavor Profile

[Brown lentils](https://groceries.morrisons.com/productImages/233/233567011_0_640x640.jpg?identifier=4ff448f1030f9ca4fff4dc3cf311f92e) are quite different from other lentils as they tend to have a more earthy and Umami flavor, they lend a great depth of flavor to the koshari base, which without the lentils wouldn't really taste of much. The technique I use to cook the base reuses the oil that the onions are fried in, so you also get a layered flavor of onion and cumin from the rice. When cooking the base I also use the liquid that the lentils were boiled in, instead of plain water, and that helps the lentil flavor really soak into the rice.

Combining the sauces is very much a matter of personal preference, so assuming you are making a dish with a small amount of chili and a couple of tablespoons of the other sauces, then here's what you would taste. The tomato sauce has a good amount of garlic and vinegar in it, when mixed with the Koshari Base it helps make the whole dish quite a bit brighter tasting. The Dakka (garlic and vinegar sauce) adds a further tangy and acidic element, this time it's a bit of a powerfull kick, but it balances out really well with the earthiness of the lentils. The chili sauce is used to add heat and spice, and it's not uncommon for people to go without it. I think it really helps round out the flavors. Finally the toppings, and I think they just add a bit more of a complex spiced flavor and some much needed sweetness to the whole dish.

## Directions

This will make enough koshari to feed 6 really hungry people . It'll probably take you 2-4 hours to make the first time around but if you're a pro multi tasker you may be able to reduce it to an hour of active time. 

### To make the chickpeas
1. Soak your dried chickpeas overnight in a large amount of room temperature water, if you're using canned chickpeas then you can skip this 
2. The next day drain your chickpeas and in a large pot boil a large amount of water (about 2 litres or quarts) and add the soaked chickpeas
3. Add a plum tomato, the onion sliced in half and 2 cloves of garlic to the pot
4. Add 1 Tsp Cumin, 1 Tsp Salt and 1/2 Tsp Cayenne to the pot and leave to boil for 1-2 hours
5. The chickpeas are ready when you can squish them between your fingers. If the water evaporates then add more till they are done cooking. Drain and set aside

### To make the Lentils
1. Add 2 litres or quarts of water to a pot and boil
2. Add 1 Tsp Salt and 1 Tsp Cumin to the water as well as your lentils
3. Boil for 30-60 minutes until cooked through but not mushy (Try aim for an al dente texture)
4. Strain the lentils using a colander, and keep any of the water they were boiled in for use later

### To make the Tomato sauce
1. Add the  Oil to a sauce pan on medium high heat
2. Mince the garlic cloves and fry in the pot for a few minutes until fragrant and bubbling
3. Before the garlic browns add the White vinegar and de-glaze the pot
4. Blend your chopped tomatoes up into a passata and add to the pot
5. Season with salt and pepper
6. Allow to simmer for 20-30 minutes until thickened and resembles a marinara

### To make the Spicy Tomato sauce
1. Slice your chilis into thin circles about 2mm wide
2. Add  Oil to a sauce pan on medium high heat
3. Mince the Garlic cloves and add to the pot with the chilis. Let them fry for a few minutes until fragrant
4. Add the white vinegar and deglaze the pot
5. Add the chopped tomatoes, salt and pepper and simmer for 20 minutes until thick and chunky

### To make the Dakkah, Garlic Vinegar sauce

2. Add 1/3C White Vinegar, 1/3C water and 1/4C Lemon juice
3. Add 2 Tsp Cumin, 1 Tsp Coriander, 1/2 Tsp Cayenne pepper and 1/2 Tsp salt and mix to combine

### To make the crispy onions
1. Slice your onions into thin strips against the grain of the onion about 2mm wide 
2. Place in a large bowl and add the Cumin, Black pepper and salt
3. Mix thoroughly until all the onion strips have been separated from each other and let sit for 30-60 minutes to macerate
4. Add frying oil to a large pot about 1.5cm or 1/2in deep, when hot add the onion in batches to fry (Reserve a handful of onions for later which we'll add to the base)
5. Fry for 8-12 minutes per batch until Golden in color, remove and place on a paper towel lined tray, they will continue to darken after removing from the oil
6. After a few minutes on the tray, move to a second tray with clean paper towels. Make sure to evenly space them and you can even dab excess oil off them so that they stay super crispy

### To make the koshari base
1. Wash your rice 3-4 times till the water runs clear and allow to dry for at least one hour
2. Remove all of the oil except 1/4 - 1/2 a cup from the pot you fried the onions in, make sure to leave any sediment in the pot as that will add flavor to the rice 
3. Fry the handful of onions that you kept aside till lightly browned
4. Add in the vermicelli and fry on high heat for 2-3 minutes until golden brown in color
5. Add the dried rice to the vermicelli and fry for a few minutes
6. Add the lentils to the rice and mix to combine
6. Add a few large Tbsp of the tomato sauce to the pot as well as 3-4 Tbsp of Dakka to the pot then mix well 
8. Add the lentil water to the pot, and top up with water until the rice and vermicelli are just barely submerged
9. Bring the pot to a boil and cover, once all of the water has evaporated from the base of the pot turn the heat down to low
10. Allow to steam for 20-30 minutes until the rice is cooked through. You may have to add some extra water if it still isn't cooked after 30 minutes, and if it is a bit soggy you may want to steam for 10 minutes with the lid off
11. Cook your pasta in heavily salted water till al dente
12. Add the cooked pasta to the rice and vermicelli in two parts and mix well till evenly combined

### To plate the Koshari

3. Add a few Tbsp of the Dakkah over the top of the tomato
4. Sprinkle some of the cooked chickpeas over the top of the dish
5. Add fried onions to the dish
6. Serve the chili sauce on the side and Enjoy

## Notes and tips
* Try to get Egyptian rice or something with a lightly chewy texture similar to Japanese rice as these work best in Koshari
* It's normal for some of the base to burn in the pot, try to use a gentle touch when mixing so you don't mix this in with the pasta
* This reheats well, but I recommend keeping the sauces seperate from the base in the fridge
* The onions will stay crispy and can be stored in a bowl for a few days, but you should keep them out of the fridge for optimal crispiness

## Variations
* There is another Koshari dish in Egypt called Koshari Ads Asfar (which means Koshari with yellow lentils) and this is similar to the original Khichiri dish
* In Iraq and Syria there is a dish called Mujadarra made with lentils, rice and onions that dates back to the 13th century"
