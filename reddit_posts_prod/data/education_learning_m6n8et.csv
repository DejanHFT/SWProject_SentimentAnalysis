Why does everything K-12 teachers learn about pedagogy seemingly cease to apply in university classrooms?,kat-kiwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/m6n8et/why_does_everything_k12_teachers_learn_about/,93,213,"We learn about educational research, innovative teaching strategies, the importance of creating an interactive classroom, different types of lessons and activities, “flipped classrooms”, etc. High school classrooms usually include some lecture component, but in my experience have a decent amount of variety when it comes to classroom experience and assessment types. I went to community college for about a year and a half, and while they’re typically more lecture-focused and have a lesser variety of assessments, they tend to incorporate a lot of the same strategies as high school classrooms. 

And then there’s university classrooms, which...are not like this at all. An hour and fifteen minutes of lecture, in a giant space where it’s hard to ask questions or have any sort of interactive component. Even in smaller classrooms with 10-30 students that allow for more teacher-student dialogue, the instruction is mostly via lectures and the students aren’t very active in the classroom except by taking notes, maybe running code at most. Depending on the class, there might be a discussion. This isn’t to say that the professors aren’t knowledgeable or good at explaining and demonstrating the material, because they often are. But clearly this isn’t the most effective way of engaging students, and a lot more of them would and could do better and learn more if the method of teaching were different. Also, assessments are usually just quizzes and tests, maybe a small homework component, if it’s not the kind of class where you can assign labs, programs/code, or papers.

I understand that universities are structured differently and necessitate larger class sizes, and that there’s a lot more responsibility on the student to study on their own. But why is everything that’s considered important in K12 teaching dropped entirely when it comes to uni? I’m sure there’s more progressive and specialized schools where this isn’t the case, but it is in all the public state schools I’m familiar with. Surely there’s a better way to engage university students instead of letting so many of them drift away, flounder, fail, and feel like they are paying for an education that isn’t helping them?"
