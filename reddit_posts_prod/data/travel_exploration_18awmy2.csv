Why don’t I want to explore new places and be excited,janitette,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18awmy2/why_dont_i_want_to_explore_new_places_and_be/,20,0,"Hi all! Been a lurker most of the time here on Reddit. I have something on my mind that I need to address and wondering if there’s a bigger issue hidden underneath. Hopefully i get the right sub. Let me know if theres a diff sub for my post please. 

For context, I’m a dive instructor fom South East Asia have traveled for work & leisure to almost 30 countries, lived abroad in several places(Hawaii, Mexico, BVIs) and now working on a private yacht for a private owner. Our mission is to bring the boat from the Caribbean to the Pacific (final destination will beFrench Polynesia) across the Panama Canal. 

Along the way, we stop in few places to explore and dive with the owners. Some places I  have never been like the San Blas are so beautiful and pristine, yet, i feel indifferent about it. In my mind i d be like, yup seen something like this before. What else is new? 

Now in Panama, im given a chance to take some days off to explore on my own and i declined that offer. I just dont wanna explore and visit places because, i get that feeling like everywhere I go, they all look alike. Been there, done that, seen that. The jungles, the beach, the blue oceans, the big cities, museums (you get the pic), I am not excited anymore. 

I am also an avid photographer. Same Meh feeling. Not inspired to capture my memories. I understand many think Im lucky I get paid to travel. But really, I feel Meh. I d be more excited to reconnect with my besties, spend time at their homes, eat and sleep and chat. Repeat. I left home for school and work since my early 20s. Now 43.

Is this normal? Anyone ever felt like this? I just need perspectives. More important, prob i want to feel excited and curious about new adventures. But i feel stuck. Thank you in advance for reading."
