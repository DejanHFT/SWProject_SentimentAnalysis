"What is the most habitable celestial body besides Earth? If we had the technology, what would the best celestial body be to move to?",REDDITKeeli,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/q21e5h/what_is_the_most_habitable_celestial_body_besides/,34,11,"This is obviously inspired by NASA and SpaceX wanting to get to Mars. SpaceX want to inhabit Mars but as it seems like a hellish place to live, what other celestial body's are out there that are closer to Earth. 

There are so many factors here like does the body have a thick atmosphere, magnetic sphere, water and breathable air. Has there been study's of the many celestial objects we've observed to find out which one is the most Earth-like?"
