How can I be supportive in this situation?,0000000000____,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pp5y0h/how_can_i_be_supportive_in_this_situation/,3,1,"Me and my husband have been together for 5 years, married 3 years ago, we're both 30 year old., and he has a 10 y.o. son with an ex girlfriend. His ex married another man, moved to another city, and he misses his son a lot. I don't have kids of my own, that's not something we want for now, but I like his son very much. 

He and his son talk on the phone everyday, he visits him always when possible, the boy often spends weekends and holidays with us, we travel together when possible, try to do nice things when he comes over, but my husband is always worried about him, he's always sad because the boy is growing so fast and he's missing out a lot of things in his life, and I know the situation is very hard for him. 

The boy can be very ungrateful sometimes, and he can say some very hurtful things. I remember this one time that his son wasn't doing so well in school, my husband tried talking to him, and the boy said something about this not being his problem because he's not around anyways. My husband cried for a week. They have a good relationship, but this one time his son was mad about being questioned over his grades and said this to hurt him, it was really unfair because he does absolutely everything possible to be a good father. Around a month ago, again, something similar happened. We were going to visit his son, but an emergency with my mother came up and we had to postpone it to another weekend. His son said a lot of hurtful things about my husband not being around, and my husband was miserable. I know he's just a child, and overall he's usually a good kid, but it really pisses me off to see what he does sometimes.

I don't know how can I help him and be supportive, because I know he's very unhappy being away from his son, it hurts me a lot to see all this situation, but it's not possible for us to move to the city where the boy currently lives.

TLDR: looking for advice on how to be supportive to my husband"
