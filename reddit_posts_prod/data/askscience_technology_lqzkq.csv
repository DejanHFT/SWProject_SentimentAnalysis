"What are the current limitation of our present technology of building a ""Drydocks"" around earth's orbit aside from budgeting?",Novirtue,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/lqzkq/what_are_the_current_limitation_of_our_present/,64,30,"I've always wondered if just like when we build naval ships to go on the ocean, we build them near the water so we don't have to spend all the energy to transport them to the water. 

Why after so many shuttle launches / satellites, etcetera, have we not developed a ""Dry dock orbital space launching station"" that could be remote controlled from earth so that we don't need to spend so much fuel to launch from the ground, and just do it from orbit? 

I realize the limitation of resources such as oxygen and materials to build said spacecraft are obvious at the moment, but what's stopping us from building some sort of an space elevator in a desolate area of Earth that we could launch materials to an orbiting station that would pass by this space elevator location certain times of the year?

From my layman understanding of satellites orbiting our planet, they are constantly in a decaying orbit, and it requires human manipulation to constantly adjust their trajectories. Is this also another limitation being imposed on building an actual structure to build ships?

I am incredibly fascinated by thinking that someday we will finally leave the cradle we call Earth, and I was wondering with all the budget and resource limitations aside is there any more explanation as to why we haven't done anything similar to this yet?

I don't believe power would be an issue, with solar power, so what are the current limitations we have?"
