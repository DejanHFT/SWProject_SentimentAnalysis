G Adventures vs other tours?,Saugaboy1992,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17wagoh/g_adventures_vs_other_tours/,3,2,"Hi all,

I am planning a trip next year, and was looking at potentially doing a trip to Greece or Peru. I've traveled solo (not on a tour) before and had a blast, but won't be able to take as much time off next year so figured a tour would help me see the most in a shorter amount of time. 

For context, im 31, and I love a good balance of partying and going out for drinks, but also taking in the sites and relaxing. 

I've been looking at the G Adventures 18 to 30 somethings trips, and the itinerary looks solid, but im slightly nervous about the groups, as from what I've read, it looks like people don't like to go out at night on G Adventures trips. I have also looked at Contiki, but it seems a bit too far on the partying side (and I also feel ill be a bit too old, especially if going to a place like Greece). 

Does anyone have any thoughts on tours like TopDeck, or others? Or would G Adventures be the best for what I'm looking for. 

Thanks!"
