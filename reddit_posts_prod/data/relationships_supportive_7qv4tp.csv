My (27f) father is dying and my boyfriend (32m) isn't being very supportive.,Saffroniax,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7qv4tp/my_27f_father_is_dying_and_my_boyfriend_32m_isnt/,22,3,"My dad has been moved to a hospice, and is having palliative care for the last few weeks of his life.

I've gone home to be with my family and look after my mum, who isn't coping. This means I'm sorting out a lot of the medical and the practical stuff like funeral arrangements as well as being basically a carer for my mum. 

I've been with my boyfriend for about 2 years. He is not really being very supportive. He obviously doesn't know what to say, and I get that. Most people don't. But he also is making it obvious to me that he doesn't really want to talk to me while I'm upset. He says it's fine, but as soon as I get upset while talking to him or talk about something to do with what I'm currently going through, he just...says nothing until I change the subject. It isn't helpful and isn't comforting to just have someone blank you while you're talking about something incredibly difficult, so I've just stopped bothering. 

Most hurtful of all is that he's not planning to visit. My brothers fianc√©e has come to stay with us while we're here, to say goodbye to my dad and to support my brother. My boyfriend won't even come down for the weekend because he has other plans. I'm guessing it's that he doesn't deal well with death or illness, but I really need him right now and he just isn't there in any capacity. 

I get that this isn't fun, and I'm not a great girlfriend right now. It isn't enjoyable to deal with this sort of thing or be around people who are upset, and I know that people struggle with how to act and what to say, but I feel like he's abandoned me to deal with it and he has washed his hands of me until I'm back to normal.

**tl;dr: My dad is dying, and my boyfriend isn't there for me.**

**edit: ** After some of the comments here, I called and we had a talk. Being specific about what I actually want supportwise has helped a lot, and he's going to help with some of the practical side of things to relieve the pressure on me. 
Making it clear that I don't expect him to know what to say or to have solutions helped him understand what I want out of conversation right now and meant we got to have a talk about what I'll need from him as things go on. 

Thank you - I think having a rant helped sort through things and let me take a step back.
