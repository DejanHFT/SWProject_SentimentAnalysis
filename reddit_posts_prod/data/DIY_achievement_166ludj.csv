How do you balance working and creating a beautiful home to live in?,Single_Mission8435,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/166ludj/how_do_you_balance_working_and_creating_a/,9,11,"I'm currently wrestling with a significant balancing act, and I need insights from those who have encountered similar challenges. Essentially, I'm feeling quite overwhelmed by the current state of my home. The combination of managing work responsibilities and my childrens school schedule has made it challenging for me to dedicate sufficient time and energy to effectively design and organize our living environment. Compounding this, we relocated to a new house within the past year, and as of now, I haven't had the opportunity to decorate or express my personal style throughout the entire space. I truly value the sense of comfort and tranquility that comes from feeling at home within my surroundings, but given my existing commitments, it's proving to be quite a struggle to find a way to achieve that.

Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? How did you manage it? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help."
