What's an easy and delicious way to enjoy canned sardines?,You-Saw-Brigadoon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/n4cxzl/whats_an_easy_and_delicious_way_to_enjoy_canned/,484,1166,"Most people are going to see this and downvote. But I'm looking for recipes for canned sardines. I'm not even talking good quality. I'm talking run-of-the-mill, cheap sardines that you buy when you can't afford anything better. I love them, and I actually really enjoy canned fish/oysters, etc. 

Anyone care to share what they do with these to ""jazz"" them up?

Edit: oh wow, I did this before going to sleep last night expecting a couple replies that I could use over the next few days. Months of recipes here! Thank all of you beautiful people for taking the time to respond! üôè"
