Best cinema experience in your whole life?,Gamer0607,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/11bo3ah/best_cinema_experience_in_your_whole_life/,1297,504,"What would you say was the best cinema experience you've ever had?

For me, it was probably the midnight screenings of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. The fact that those 2 films lived up to the hype was also crazy.

Close 3rd would be The Dark Knight Rises opening day. I remember how excited I was during my IMAX screening and nearly cried over the last 5 minutes of the film. I had followed the entire marketing of the film, from the very first Bane image, teasers, IMAX prologue, trailers, to online forums and discussion boards. Perfect ending to a perfect trilogy. TDK I also saw 3 times at the cinema opening weekend.

Honorable mentions: The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. I was insanely hyped for the latter, and then the film started... ""Your momma"" joke in the first 5 mins. I immediately knew *this was not going to go the way I think.* Still an incredible and exciting night leading up to that midnight screening."
