Goal Achieved: 20 Pull Ups Non-Stop,codemonkey_uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1g7vyu/goal_achieved_20_pull_ups_nonstop/,13,5,"In November last year, I decided, after 2 years of running as my only exercise to do some upper body work as well. For no particular reason I decided I should be able to do 20 pull ups (or chin ups).

I did 3. Barely. My arms were ruined. I could hardly lift them over my head for 3 days.

So I kept at it for 2 months, 3 times a week. 3 sets of as many as I could, split up by running circuits of the park. Slowly added reps week by week. Progress stopped for a while, but I didn't give up.

I joined a gym in February. I went 3 times a week. Then 4 times a week. I did weights. I started reading /r/fitness. I fixed my program. I fixed my diet.

Last week I tested 15 in a row. Made it. Felt like I could do more.

This morning I did 20 in a row, no stopping.

Achievement unlocked. Very happy. Pick your goals and never give up.

But what next?"
