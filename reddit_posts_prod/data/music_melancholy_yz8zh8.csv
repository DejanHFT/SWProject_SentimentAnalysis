Melancholy - Whats your instrumental take on turning inwards and shutting the world out?,LazyWerewolf6993,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/yz8zh8/melancholy_whats_your_instrumental_take_on/,8,6,"Hi! Kind of a first post here, but i'd like to give it a shot.  
I have scrolled through dozens upon dozens of threads for the longest time, looking for melancholic/introverted songs, but 99% of them always express sadness(?) through lyrics.  
I'd like to ask of you for suggestions on melancholy where speech, singing and lyrics take a back seat and the mood is expressed via the music itself.  


Its hard to specify it in words (joke unintended), so i will set you off with a few obscure gems i have gathered over the years. May you find fulfillment in it.  
Thanks for adding to the list and for the suggestions in advance!
