How do you motivate yourself to exercise for depression?,intifada87,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/41c3xx/how_do_you_motivate_yourself_to_exercise_for/,157,214,"I'm 28 and I've been dealing with depression on and off since puberty. I've never been much of sporty/athletic person, but I also never had an issue with food or my weight (I was actually underweight through my teens and early 20s and always wanted to be curvier). Now I'm about 5'3"" and 110 pounds. So, suffice it to say, I don't need or want to exercise to lose weight.

Everyone knows that exercise has been shown to help people with depression. The problem is, every form of exercise I've ever tried has been awful, excruciating, and I hated every second of it (during and afterwards). The longest period I exercised consistently (4-5 times per week) was about two months. Not only was my experience miserable, my depression symptoms never improved during this time. I've tried running (treadmill and outdoors)--never once experienced that ""runner's high"" everyone talks about. I've tried strength training, yoga, biking, you name it. I just don't feel good doing it. My mood actually gets worse over time because I get frustrated that I'm not enjoying it like I think I'm supposed to.

Intellectually, I know I should exercise because I have a desk job and it's healthy to be physically active. So my question is--if you're not exercising to lose weight, but rather to improve your mood, how do you motivate yourself to keep going when it feels so fucking miserable? I'd love to hear your experiences!

**Edit:** I'm not looking for medical advice as I have sought medical help and tried other options for treating depression.  The purpose of my post is to hopefully get anecdotes and suggestions for motivating myself."
