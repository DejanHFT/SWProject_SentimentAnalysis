Getting a bit tired of books spelling everything out for us,majer_lazor,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/198urw2/getting_a_bit_tired_of_books_spelling_everything/,323,485,"Maybe I'm not be choosing the best books to read. I love literary fiction and classics, but it often seems a lot of the pop literary fiction overexplains things to death, the ""metaphors"" are obvious and explicit, every emotional undertone or plot background is just given to us (don't want to dump on any books in particular)  

I miss the books where there's more subtlety and nuance to dig into. Let me use my critical thinking abilities. Anyone else feel this way?

Edit: I’m sure there are always good books and worse books in any period of time

Just complaining for the sake of complaining 

it might be more helpful if I illuminate which types of books. I try to do a rotation of the kinds of books I read and contemporary literary fiction ~1 out of every 3 books

But I’m just finding big differences between for example The Nightwatchman by Louise Erdrich and Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng or Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine

I can give more examples if needed lol"
