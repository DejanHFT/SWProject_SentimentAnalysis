G adventures question,Kind-Requirement9481,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15izsys/g_adventures_question/,3,2,"I want to go on a “18 to 30 something” trip with G adventures this summer, I am 18 and would go alone and was wondering if there are (in your experience) many teenagers/ collage aged kids or if there are mainly people in their mid 20’s/ 30’s."
