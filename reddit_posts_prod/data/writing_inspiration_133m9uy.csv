Inspiration or inability to move on?,alisabette,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/133m9uy/inspiration_or_inability_to_move_on/,10,18,"I have been slowly improving my writing by reading and writing fan fiction. I figure that it is good practice to work with existing story worlds, characters and themes that many people of the fandom would recognise. I am thinking a lot of moving to original writing, but I recognise that I am unable to escape inspiration, and I fear that I can copy more than I realise. 

There is one work in particular that I cannot move on from, and I’ve been thinking of taking the premise from it and taking inspiration from it into my own work. Here’s the thing. I usually write fan fiction in bursts of inspiration without much planning of every single chapter and just winging it essentially. I set out the main plot for myself in advance, and start writing for a few continuous hours until I am happy with the chapter. I go back and change and re write some things, but I am aware that drafts usually have a lot more work done from them. I plan on learning more and working with my impatience of just pumping out writing, as I want to do better and create work I am proud of. 

For original work I’m a bit stumped. I get attached to characters and the way they make me feel, and a way I found what works for me is taking that character (or the basic personality) and place them (alone, leaving out the original work) in a new world, new setting, changing their name and background. But then it feels a bit wrong. 

I have done some research concerning my concerns on inspiration, and I found this quote that is harsh but I really needed to hear:

“Inspiration is not fandom. If you read the Lord of the Rings and feel you want to write a book like the Lord of the Rings, then you are not inspired, but suffer from post partum depression: you are sad that the book ends and you can no longer live in that fictional universe. If, on the other hand, you read the Lord of the Rings and you feel that you need to tell a different story, then that is inspiration.”

And I fear that this may be true. I fall in love with the writing, the story, the progression and want to write something like it. But I also realise that I won’t be proud of myself by copying work and changing a few things, that’s just morally wrong and plagiarism. I am prepared to completely change and brainstorm things, but then I worry that my own writing will never compare and be a cheap imitation, from the inability to let go.

How do you deal with such issues, and maybe anyone has advice that will let me see things in a different angle?"
