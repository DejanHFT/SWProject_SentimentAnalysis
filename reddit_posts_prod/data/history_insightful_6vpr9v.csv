Recommendations for good books to learn more about Industrial Revolution era England/Europe.,articanomaly,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6vpr9v/recommendations_for_good_books_to_learn_more/,5,4,"Im looking for some insightful books about late 18th Century England/Europe, mostly around the period of the industrial revolution (1740's onwards).

Particularly interested in city life, politics and monarchy, development of science and a little warfare. 

I want to know about a wide slice of the population, their thoughts about industry as it took off and the effects it had on all aspects of life. "
