Adventure Week,ccoltmanm,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/12agp7j/adventure_week/,4,1,"I am taking my 18 year old nephew, his gf, my wife, and my sister (his mom) on a trip somewhere for a week in June. The goal was adventure for me and my nephew. 4x4s, zip lines, things like that. 

I was thinking of Costa Rica, but with the possibility of another 4 athletic people going, I was thinking of an all inclusive in Dominican Republic to make the food and lodging easier. Excursions thru the hotel align nicely and everyone that doesn’t go with us on adventures has a resort. 

I’d like suggestions. I’m trying to keep the total price with air and lodging under $1800 or so, but excursion I’ll pay for so that can go a little more. 

I just figure there has to be some places I’m not thinking of that will give him an amazing week after graduation of adventure. We are from the US. My wife and I are expert travelers."
