Cinema regrets,Ramonteiro12,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16iisq8/cinema_regrets/,141,5,"Are there any movies you regret not watching at the cinema?

I always talk about my favorite movie of all time, The Green Mile. But in 1999 I was just too young to go to the movies watch something like that.

Inside Out is also my favorite animation and I skipped it at theaters because I thought the poster was silly. (Boy was I wrong)

I also think about A Quiet Place because of the brilliant sound design in the film...

But none of these come close to Life is Beautiful and the gut wrenching experience it must have been to get in the theater looking forward to a Roberto Benigni's comedy and leaving it devastated.

What are the movies you wish you had seen at theaters but you didn't?"
