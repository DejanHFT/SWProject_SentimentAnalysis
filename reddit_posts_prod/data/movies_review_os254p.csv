'The Green Knight' Review Thread,SanderSo47,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/os254p/the_green_knight_review_thread/,926,2752,"[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_green_knight): 95% (37 reviews) with 8.60 in average rating

> Critics consensus: The Green Knight honors and deconstructs its source material in equal measure, producing an absorbing adventure that casts a fantastical spell.

[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-green-knight): 89/100 (18 critics)

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie.

> This is a boldly unconventional film full of beguiling ambiguities, which eschews the hard-charging action and self-consciously modern attitudes that made the King Arthur entries of Antoine Fuqua and Guy Ritchie such generic duds. Instead, it embraces the strange remoteness of myth and Middle Ages lore on its own terms and creates something quietly dazzling and new.

-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/dev-patel-in-david-lowerys-the-green-knight-1234987039/)

> Surreal, stoned, and glistening with a layer of heavy metal realness, David Lowery's medieval adventure is a chivalric romance for the ages.

-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2021/07/the-green-knight-review-1234653532/): A-

> The director turns a fantastical dream-poem into the myth under the myth of popular culture.

-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/the-green-knight-review-dev-patel-alicia-vikander-david-lowery-1235026883/)

> There are only a few questions that “The Green Knight” doesn’t have ungenerous answers to, and it shows whenever Lowery and his team can’t bridge the gap between the movie’s images and their emotional content. So while there’s a lot of commendable chutzpah and curious longing baked into “The Green Knight,” the movie’s never as compelling as it is unusual.

-[Simon Abrams, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/the-green-knight-review-dev-patel-david-lowery-alicia-vikander/)

> David Lowery’s complex, visually sumptuous and uncommercial tale of Arthurian legend revels in upending expectations.

-[Charles Bramesco, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/26/the-green-knight-review-dev-patel-takes-a-magical-and-masterly-quest): 4/5

> The Green Knight is truly astounding. Defying the standards for Arthurian legend adaptations, it heavily favors atmosphere and mood over action and monologues. Substantial performances marry with director David Lowery's sumptuous style to create a film that is sensational, less about story than the experience. If you can get on the wavelength of such an artful quest, you’ll be rewarded. Once you’ve found that footing, The Green Knight is a heart-rattling, loins-riling, and head-spinning trip that packs a profound punch.

-[Kristy Puchko, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-green-knight-review-dev-patel): 9.0 ""amazing""

> Despite The Green Knight‘s opaque obscurity and scattered whims, there’s a clear beginning, middle and end structure that crescendos with a scintillating third Act. Nobility, generosity of spirit and gallantry may not hold as much significance in a contemporary world. But Lowery and company force the issue with a deft touch that manages to bridge the gap between the eons of separation.

-[Brandon Katz, Observer](https://observer.com/2021/07/the-green-knight-review-a24-dev-patel-david-lowery/): 3/4

> There are shades of Ingmar Bergman’s “The Seventh Seal” and John Boorman’s “Excalibur” in “The Green Knight,” although Lowery’s film feels wonderfully fresh mining old-school legend. The filmmaker delves into the ancient push-and-pull between Christianity and Paganism with frequent use of religious imagery and puts together a sensational climactic sequence that out-cools most episodes of “Game of Thrones.” “The Green Knight” is so unlike anything else that, whether you or not you’re an Arthurian scholar, you’ll lose your head over it.

-[Brian Truitt, USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/07/26/the-green-knight-review-dev-patel-leads-dazzling-arthurian-quest/8077431002/): 3.5/4

> This is, in the end, a spectacle of contradictions: as grandiose as the canon of tales to which it belongs but also oddly intimate in focus, with a modern psychology that clashes productively with its squalid evocation of the far bygone yesteryear.

-[A. A. Dowd, The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/dev-patel-david-lowery-and-a24-give-arthurian-legend-1847362082): B+

> The enormity of this film intimidates me. And it hypnotizes me, and seduces me, and captures me until it feels as if the green has grown like moss over my entire body. But rather than threatening to choke, The Green Knight injects a new source of oxygen into the sword-and-sorcery genre.

-[Carlos Aguilar, The Playlist](https://theplaylist.net/green-knight-david-lowery-dev-patel-review-20210726/): A

> Lowery more than catches an attentive audience’s attention with this film. His dazzling visuals, brilliant spectacle, and petrifying sequences are enrapturing. Likewise, Patel finally lays claim to the leading-man mantle so often bequeathed to him, yet so rarely earned. His career-defining performance should establish him as an actor made for big, grand epics. Lowery’s The Green Knight is cinema’s best Arthurian adaptation, which may matter only to literary scholars. Everyone else will have to settle for it being one of the best movies of 2021.

-[Robert Daniels, Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22594354/green-knight-review): 3.5/4

> “The Green Knight” asks a lot of its viewers—to stay engaged with what could be called its slow pace, to consider its themes without them being underlined for easy consumption, to be willing to see a film about famous knight that contains very little in the way of traditional heroism. It is scary, sexy, and strange in ways that American films are rarely allowed to be, culminating in a sequence that cast the whole film in a new light for this viewer. We're all just sitting in that banquet hall, listening to the story requested by King Arthur, told by a master storyteller.
