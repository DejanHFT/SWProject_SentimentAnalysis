Particle board subfloor removal,redfishslayerr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/zkkjtx/particle_board_subfloor_removal/,8,5,"Removing carpet to install LVP for 1200 sq. ft.

Under carpet is 1/4-1/2” of particle board (practically disintegrating) and then 1/2 plywood. 

Particle board looks to be nailed every 6”. Hoping it’s not glued and screwed.

Should I lay plywood substrate after removing particle board to achieve 3/4” subfloor? Or does that really just depend on LVP requirements?
