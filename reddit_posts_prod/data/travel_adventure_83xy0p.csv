Adventure Travel without Extreme Exercise,skD1am0nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/83xy0p/adventure_travel_without_extreme_exercise/,37,10,"At this point in my life (57 years old) adventure is my primary focus. While not rich, I do have the means to travel and can exit work for months at a time. I’ve done some adventurous trips already.  For example in summer of 2016 I backpacked the 2,650 miles of the Pacific Crest trail and last summer I rode my bicycle across USA. This summer I’m planning a bike ride across Europe. But I’m getting older and there is growing evidence that high endurance activities are actually unhealthy for your heart (and I have a heart condition myself). So I’m looking for adventure ideas that don’t involve a high level of physical endurance (I have no shortage of options for those that do). I’m struggling with this. I tend to be quite goal oriented. For example, I don’t really see flying to Europe and visiting a number of cities as terribly satisfying. I definitely don’t want to sign up for an organized tour and check off places. I’d need a project or goal. The Europe example might work if I had goal to photograph a series of churches or study a period of art history but for now I can’t think of an interest I have that is that compelling. Any ideas from Reddit for an extended (3-6 month) adventure? Ideas that I’ve come up with include:

- Sailing around the world (or some portion)
- Hitchhiking through South America 
- Extended Motorcycle trip (but would need to be in exotic location not US)
- Peace corps like activity 
- Any job at the Antarctic Research Station

Thanks for all input.
