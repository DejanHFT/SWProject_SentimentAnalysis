How did a pre-electric world interpret static shocks?,Takakikun,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/ez2atb/how_did_a_preelectric_world_interpret_static/,325,2935,"Static shocks are nearly an everyday occurrence that we in this age push off as a slight annoyance, but thatâ€™s likely because we understand electricity and what happens in a statically charged surface. 

In a world prior to knowledge about electricity, I can only imagine that static shocks would be completely baffling or even seen as unnatural (complete postulation). 

Curious to know if there are any accounts referencing what we know today as simply a static shock, and in particular how such occurrences were interpreted."
