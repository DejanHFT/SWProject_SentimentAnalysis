Ear Protection Weapons Technology,bitterjack,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1ompm8/ear_protection_weapons_technology/,16,7,"Would it be possible to filter a really loud sound (high in decibels) at a specific frequency, yet still be able to hear something else like a whisper? 

My question revolves around the idea of using sound as a weapon in close quarters combat. Say if we developed technology to throw a grenade like transmitter that continually emits an extremely loud sound at a specific frequency that humans can hear, (3,500hz) and also developed an accompanying technology that goes in your ear canal and acts as an audio filter/amplifier that filters all the sound at 3,500hz, but nothing else. 

If we used something like this technology would we be able to hear other sounds like someone talking or walking? 
Would we need to block a range of frequency to block out the sound blast?

My thought was something like this: We have dog whistles, that dogs can hear and humans cannot. If we created a filtering technology, would it not be the same as simply being not sensitive to that frequency of sound, and thus being able to hear everything else normally? "
