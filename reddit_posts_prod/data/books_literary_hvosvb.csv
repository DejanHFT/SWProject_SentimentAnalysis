What is the appeal of Literary Fiction,strangefruit3500,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hvosvb/what_is_the_appeal_of_literary_fiction/,46,0,"I've been making an effort to branch out from genre fiction into literary fiction lately. I went in expecting some deep new insights, masterful prose, or innovative literary techniques. But I'm finding it very boring and not particularly insightful. Literary fiction often doesn't have exciting action or plot developments. While there are themes/philosphies explored and/or interesting character writing; I don't think its being done any better than good genre fiction books. I don't want to sound like a dick, but I'm starting to think literary fiction is just an excuse for snobbish people to engage in mastubatory elitism. I'm not saying these books are bad, but I don't understand why they have achieved legendary status. For reference, my recent reads are ""The Stranger"" by Albert Camus, ""Siddhartha"" by Herman Hess, ""Never Let Me Go"" by Kazuo Ishiguro, and ""The Brief Wonderous Life of Oscar Wao"" by Junot Diaz (I thought this one was pretty solid but still don't get the hype). I feel the same way about a lot of the literary fiction read in high school (Gatsby, Dante's Inferno, Tale of Two Cities, etc).

My intention isn't to shit on the genre. I'm just genuinely curious as to why these books are so revered. Maybe I'm missing something, and yall can give me new perspective."
