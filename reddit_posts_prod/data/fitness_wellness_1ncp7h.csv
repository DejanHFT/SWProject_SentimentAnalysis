My Fit Cave,TarenMaim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1ncp7h/my_fit_cave/,102,473,"Hi Fittit,

I present to you...my fit cave :D

All the big ticket items are gifts to myself for hitting fitness milestones

The sandbag and dip station for working out for 30 consecutive days

The treadmill I picked up used when I finally ran 5k

The mats and room I set up when I lost 20 lbs

And now the bench and weights to celebrate running my first half marathon 

There are also some smaller items I picked up along the way to keep me motivated

It's actually a 2 piece set, a bench with walk out squat stand 

I purchased it on sale for $209 at Canadian Tire for all you canucks :)
