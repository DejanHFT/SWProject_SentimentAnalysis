"Dear Pantsers aka those who don't outline, how the heck does that work? I wanna know what keeps you grounded and inspired!!",random_listener_lmao,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/181fne6/dear_pantsers_aka_those_who_dont_outline_how_the/,202,195,"Hi! I can't for the life of me write as I go along. I always get into a slump or get lost without outlining. To those who do this predominantly, do you have any tips on how I should execute it next time? I think there's still value in the pantsing process even if it hasn't worked for me yet.

I've pantsed when I was younger, when I only got started going into writing, and I have zero regrets. It just feels like I lost that skill.

Thank you to those who respondd!!!"
