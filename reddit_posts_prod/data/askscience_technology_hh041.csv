Are children getting nearsighted because of technology?,SausageChowder,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/hh041/are_children_getting_nearsighted_because_of/,11,21,"Took my kid to the eye doctor today.  She said something that had me scratching my head.  She said that they (the eye doctors) are seeing more children come in needing a prescription for near sightedness because of the handheld game consoles, sitting in front of a computer, etc.
It seems anecdotal to me, at best.  Is there any truth behind what she told us?"
