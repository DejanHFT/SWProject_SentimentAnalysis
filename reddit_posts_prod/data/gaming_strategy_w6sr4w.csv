Strategy/management/4X game suggestions?,somenoob240,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/w6sr4w/strategymanagement4x_game_suggestions/,2,0,"Howdy guys. I’ve been trying to scratch a particular itch, which is more strategy games - preferably something more “grand,” like HOI or something, and being a more modern war/arms management game. I’ve tried (most) popular things like Aurora 4X, HOI, CK, etc. Love Aurora (mostly for the equipment creation and management). Not so much interested in things like Gunsmith; more so about the numbers and planning, so basically “on-paper” logistics. 

Sorry if my craving is a little hard to fill, the closest I’ve got is just Aurora. 

TL;DR I want to play spreadsheet games"
