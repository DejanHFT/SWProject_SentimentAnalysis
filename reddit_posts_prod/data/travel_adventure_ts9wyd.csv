"Seeking Honeymoon Location: Animal Experiences, Adventure Sports, Ethical",Primary-Ad7221,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ts9wyd/seeking_honeymoon_location_animal_experiences/,11,2,"Hey there! After a few wedding cancellations because of the pandemic, my wife and I are putting the money towards a two-week honeymoon. She loves animals, I love being active--and we both like contributing to relatively non-exploitative economies. For these reasons, we loved Costa Rica last year!

Safe Adventure Sports in Play: Kitesurfing, rock climbing, cliff jumping, mountain biking, bungy jumping, waterskiing/wakeboarding, soccer...

Preferred animal experiences are those in the wild--safaris, hikes where we see monkeys and sloths, or other animals, snorkeling

Looking for relatively warm weather in July--any suggestions? TIA!"
