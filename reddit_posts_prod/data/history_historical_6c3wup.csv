What's your favorite quote by a historical figure?,STNP,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6c3wup/whats_your_favorite_quote_by_a_historical_figure/,385,488,"Is there any quote by a famous historical person that you love or that you find interesting based on the person's life?

The quote can be from any time period and any part of the world!

I like this interesting (disputed) quote by Roman Emperor Caligula:

""Let them hate (me) so long as they fear (me)."" 

It reminds me of the video game Stronghold in which you can keep your subjects obeying you by either making them like you or by making them fear you..."
