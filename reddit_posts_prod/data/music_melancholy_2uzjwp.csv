Depressing songs about self hate that put you right at the fangs of melancholy?,thenoisewall,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/2uzjwp/depressing_songs_about_self_hate_that_put_you/,27,23,please don't post sappy sad songs that are just sad lyrically but don't deliver music-wise. don't want to hear hopeful chin up shit either. songs like Hurt by NIN or the Johnny Cash cover
