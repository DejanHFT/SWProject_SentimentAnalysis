AI effects on the art/design/creative industries,GeekUSA1979,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/13uphgh/ai_effects_on_the_artdesigncreative_industries/,13,3,"Hi all, 

I'm looking for someone who has knowledge of the effects AI is currently having as it emerges more with the Art Industry. Maybe an artist who uses AI in their work, or a traditional artist who has their own feelings/thoughts about AI going forward. 

I am a journalist and currently working on a piece that speaks about this topic. 

Thanks heaps :)"
