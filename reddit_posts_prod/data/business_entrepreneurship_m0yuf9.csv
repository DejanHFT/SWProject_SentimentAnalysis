Selling the dream of entrepreneurship! Shady business practices of MLM/Direct Sales.,NishadJoshichillin,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/m0yuf9/selling_the_dream_of_entrepreneurship_shady/,0,4,"  **Disclaimer:-**

In this article, I have tried to expose the shady business practices of network marketing companies and direct sales and marketing companies. In this article, I have shared my own experience. Take everything written here with a pinch of salt. 

**1. Phase 1(Why would you do this? /Who will end up here):**

So, It's February 2019. You just graduated from your college and you are unemployed. Suddenly your peers including your parents start forcing you to ""GET YOU ASS OFF TO WORK NOW"". So, in this situation what do you do? You go on job searching websites like shine, Monster, ETC. I sent my resume to a bunch of companies... And within 2 hours, I get a call

… Ring ring… 

I answer: ""Hello? 

The HR lady on the other side asks you to come for an interview on the very next day to their office for an interview. 

I said: Yes, I will be there at 9 am.

(P.S. Remember I was a fresher so I don't know much about the corporate world or how the jobs work or what pyramid schemes are.).

**2. Phase 2 (The interview):**

I show up to the interview and after the first round...you go out on the field with your trainer. At this point, something didn't felt right. ""Is it a scam? Is it a pyramid scheme? Hey, I didn't apply to be a salesman? But still, you are the kind of person who cannot be brutally honest, I was thinking I spend this much time with this girl so let’s just go with the flow. You come back to the office and say YES to the job.

\#WORSTMISTAKE. 

I got hooked. 

**3. Phase 3 (Introduction of your job role and your upline):**

Pay attention here, this is the most important part of this business, here you notice the owner driving a high-end luxury car, he has a big house which costs a million dollars. and he did everything by just going door to door asking for donations for the charity and building a team of 12 people. That's It? You must be surprised. 

By now you already have gotten two syndromes 

Number 1: Survivorship bias (If he can do it I can too)

Number 2: Wishful Identification (He has a Merc s class? he has a big house? I want that too.) 

(P.S. Within the first week I got promoted to a Corporate trainer position.)

**4. Phase 4(The Joining):**

You joined. After joining the company the first week is your honeymoon phase. You start to attend their morning meetings which usually are filled with a cult-like following of the uplines, and you are taught with a lot of self-help, leadership building and somewhat of finance management. You must be thinking ""Nishad what's wrong with that? Very few companies do that... Train their people with all of that."" But remember there is a saying: "" The best salesmen are those who didn't even make their prospects feel like they sold you something"". 

**5. Phase 5 (They just sold you a dream):**

They sold you a dream. The dream consists of buzzwords such as ""Financial freedom, be your boss, Entrepreneurship, Leadership, 9 to 5 is being a slave"" in very fancy terms, right? I am not saying it’s not possible, it is 100% possible. But You are brainwashed into thinking that being good in this job is your final fate. If You can't be a competent person in this job that means you are useless. You have a slave mindset that is 9 to 5. While every day you hear ""everything in life is a challenge"" this statement leads you to turn a blind eye or in other words create a loophole to avoid legitimate criticism. The teaching of the morning meeting keeps getting over your rational thinking. You slowly start losing the passion for the job that you worked with full passion and whole heart.

**6. Phase 6 (Human Attachment with isolation):**

Let’s Face the fact, we all as humans if we spend more time with a person then we are more likely to trust the individual and get attached to him/her. There is nothing wrong with getting attached. But also, unknowingly you slowly start to remove all the skepticism and you shut your rational part of the brain. You are isolated from your friends and family. You go home just to sleep, no more connection with family and your loved ones. This attachment and isolation slowly destroy your self-confidence, your abilities to handle other issues in life. 

**7. Phase 7(Toxic Positivity):**

Every day you read motivational quotes on your what's app groups, in the morning meetings, every week you go to celebrate at expensive bars and restaurants, you feel like you are making progress it’s just the one last thing you need to do to become an owner, but suddenly you look back and realize nothing has changed. You start to realize your ""friends/business partners"" how fake those smiles were and how fake they are. Last but not least due to these constant parties and fieldwork your wallet is dried up and finally after seeing those real faces you decide to quit the company with a broken heart and a lot of pain with agony. 

**8. Phase 8(I have few questions for them)**

By making this video I am already in the category of a hater. Some of the former colleagues might say “Nishad because you didn’t stay in the company doesn’t mean the company is not legit.” You are right but I have few simple questions. On the very first day, you are told that you will be a “CEO/Owner of your own business”

So, if you are a CEO then tell me do you have any control over the following:

1. Do you decide what product/service will be launched in the market?

2. Do you know the R&D reports? 

3. Do you know what category your product/services fall into? 

4. Do you control the commission structure?

5. Do you control the production costs of the products/services?

6. Hypothetical question: IF the NGO you are raising funds for let’s say tomorrow the FBI finds out that the organization was a fraud, then are you willing to the compensation to the donors you took money from?

7. Or if you start selling products in the future if the consumer of your products gets some health problems by using your products and he/she has the proof for it then will you pay the compensation and the hospital bills from your pocket? 

&#x200B;

Many of these companies who work with pyramid-like structures like to say "" Look Nike also has the same structure! they also have a CEO and other people working around them, then why don't you call them a pyramid scheme? You are right here but how many people who join Nike leave within the first 6 months? Do they get paid for the amount of work they have done? YES!

IF the answers to my questions are more than 80% in a “NO” then you should know that they sold you a dream. 

**Conclusion**

Look I am not against network marketing companies, or direct sales and marketing agencies who work on a similar model of direct sales and marketing companies. You must be thinking “Nishad, why are you so bitter? Why are you so salty? No one put a gun on your head to join this company, IF you are thinking about this then you can’t be right than anyone else in this world who is reading this. But just in my defense, I would like to say this… Taking advantage of someone who is naïve and who is not familiar with the corporate world, or taking advantage of someone’s vulnerability and by constantly humiliating, destroying their self-confidence is NOT ETHICAL. Here you sell emotions to the people who are working for you and also to the clients. I understand marketing is about emotions but selling them for a cause wherein, not even the fundraiser knows where the money goes, Now that sounds sketchy. Or it smells fishy. At this point, you must be thinking how come if this is the truth why it is not considered illegal? Look the business model is like this you go out on the field and you raise funds you get a 16.5 % commission. That’s why this is yet called a pyramid scheme. They have used a loophole to project themselves as a legitimate business.  

If you have the qualities to join these companies then feel free to join, I am not going to question you but just to be clear… You should know what are you doing and how it is affecting people’s minds and hearts. Currently, I have my own consultancy business. After leaving this organization I decided one thing We will be honest with our employees. WE DON’T give them a fake smile. And fake promises, we don’t sell our clients emotions, we sell them the services and products which will solve their problems. Thanks for reading. Until next time."
