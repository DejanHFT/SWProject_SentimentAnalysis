Looking for adventurous recommendations in Southeast Asia.,Luke-__-,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/14vj9tx/looking_for_adventurous_recommendations_in/,6,1,"I love almost every facet of traveling but have been trying to get in the habit of doing something really challenging each trip I take. I know it’s very subjective but I’d love some ideas for an upcoming 2 month trip to Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. I like adrenaline sports and anything physically demanding but am open to anything mentally/intellectually challenging as well. Thanks!"
