When is enough travel and adventure enough?,NebulaFancy4049,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17qnm2c/when_is_enough_travel_and_adventure_enough/,26,18,"Hi folks, looking for advice and shared experience. I’m recently returned from a yearlong sabbatical in which I rode my bicycle across South America.

I love my life, family and career back home and am pretty good about finding the joy in daily life (trying new things, passionate about hobbies, habits, exercise, meditation, etc). Still, the transition to regular life (bills, drama, consumerism, etc) is a bit tough. 

While I am grateful and satisfied by the huge adventure I’ve just had, I’m already dreaming about the next one. I find myself brainstorming ways to take next summer off. Which would be a problem for work and my partner, who doesn’t have the same thirst for adventure that I have.

And I feel like, even if I did takeoff next summer and went on another adventure, I would come back and want to do it again. And again. And again.

At some point, I feel like this becomes unsustainable. How do you get to a point where enough is enough?

Ive been wondering if it’s similar to somebody who is obsessed with material possessions. Who gets a house, and then wants a bigger house. Or who gets a new car, and then starts dreaming about the next bigger, better, newer car. Pedal across South America? Now let’s pedal across Africa. Let’s paddle across a continent. Let’s row across an ocean. I’m starting to think there is no end.

TLDR: do you think the desire for “more,” whether experiential or materialistic, ultimately are the same affliction? How do you manage your desire for more travel/adventure when it conflicts with other aspects of your life? Where do you draw the “enough” line? Thanks."
