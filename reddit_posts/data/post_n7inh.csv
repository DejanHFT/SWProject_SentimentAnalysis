"In the future, will AI technology be able to design complex technology in an extremely short period of time?",l3un1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/n7inh/in_the_future_will_ai_technology_be_able_to/,8,0,"To clarify my question, I am asking if Artificial Intelligences will have the ability to create entirely original software, hardware (designs), and games in an extremely short period of time. What would take weeks and months of design would be created in minutes, seconds, or even on cue. 

This question actually came to mind when I was dreaming of Skyrim (don’t we all?). I thought of the possibility that artificial intelligences would be able to “dream” up an entire landscape designed for exploring, similar to how the brain creates what seem like virtual worlds within our minds (ex. me exploring Skyrim in a dream, and my brain creating the landscape I was exploring). The question I asked is an extension of this basic concept; AI will be able to create technology and design products much more quickly than humans currently can.

EDIT: I am referring to an AI that would behave similarly like a human (i.e. creativity, personality, essentially human); it is simply much, much faster at accomplishing design goals.  Whether we can actually create an AI *similar in nature to this*, with the ability to create what I specified above is what I would like to know.
