> -Alden Ehrenreich engagingly conveys young Harrison Ford in this throwback origins story directed by Ron Howard.

> -Solo: A Star Wars Story is classic Star Wars, and if it ends up being the last time Lawrence Kasdan writes a movie in this universe, it’s one incredibly entertaining, instructive swan song.

[Collider](http://collider.com/solo-movie-review/) - *Matt Goldberg*

> -And sadly, Solo: A Star Wars Story is just another Star Wars movie. Despite the strong performance from Ehrenreich and the hint of future adventures to come, I can only hope that this young Solo gets better stories and better direction that play into the character’s personality. Han Solo is a roguish, daring character. Shouldn’t his movie follow suit?

[IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/15/solo-a-star-wars-story-review) - *Jim Vejvoda*

> -Solo: A Star Wars Story commits to being a charming and fun exercise in repackaging nostalgia and pre-owned protagonists. It’s just too bad its script never fully committed to seeing through Han’s arc — and those characters who are supposed to have shaped him into being the iconic version we all know and love — to its preordained end.

> -While a solid effort, ‘Solo: A Star Wars Story’ doesn’t do much of great interest when it’s not dramatizing everything we’ve previously heard about Han.

[Associated Press](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/review-scoundrel-born-star-wars-spinoff-solo-55188290) - *Lindsay Bahr*

> -""Solo"" is a straightforward piece of pulpy entertainment with some very agreeable performances from Ehrenreich and Glover, who seems to be having the most fun of all the actors in playing up Lando's suave demeanor, and fun classic Western flourishes, despite the excessively big action sequences.

> -I enjoyed Solo: A Star Wars Story more than I expected to, but it’s also the first live-action theatrical Star Wars film that doesn’t feel like an event. I’ll let you decide if that’s a compliment or a criticism.

> -Howard’s efficient, confident, slightly square direction does the job. It’s his best film in a decade. At times, working with a small army of digital wizards, he seems to be channeling the spirit of the car-crash pileups of “Grand Theft Auto.” Only this time, the vehicles really move.

[Den of Geek](http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/solo-a-star-wars-story/273494/solo-a-star-wars-story-review) - *Don Kaye*

> -Solo is not a bad film, just a relentlessly average one that has no reason to exist except as a money machine. It gets its protagonist from point A to point B efficiently enough, but it doesn’t tell us anything we need to know that we didn’t already glean from our first meeting with Han in a cantina 40 years ago. It doesn’t shake up the mythology or offer any real emotional investment, yet at the same time it’s funny, fairly fast-moving and at times enjoyable

> -Han Solo gets a good (but not great) origin tale
