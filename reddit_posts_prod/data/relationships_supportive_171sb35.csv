How do I [19M] support my [20F] girlfriend?,ThrowRA_Sup_port,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/171sb35/how_do_i_19m_support_my_20f_girlfriend/,4,1,"Me and my LDR girlfriend of 1 year (I've known her for 2 years) have recently been going through some problems.  
  
We talked a lot every day, but very recently, she has been going through a stressful period (lots of tests/assignments). She also has some personal things she's been working through and thinks that she isn't independent and doesn't know what she wants to do/be.  
  
Very recently, she came to me and told me that she doesn't think that she can handle a relationship right now. She says that she loves me, and thinks I'm perfect for her, but she says that she can't handle all the emotional burden that being in a relationship gives.  
  
I'm willing to do whatever it takes to stay. I want to do anything I can to support her, and if that means her not putting in any effort for a time, that's fine with me. When I brought this up with her, however, she told me that she doesn't want to be the type of girlfriend that always takes but can't give anything back to me. She says that I deserve someone better--someone who can dedicate their attention to me and give me their all.  
  
I think she's scared that if she can't give me her all, it will damage our relationship forever. How can I convince her that I really just want to support her and help her through her problems?
