New study puts Indo-European language origins in Turkey/North Mesopotamia and then moving to the Steppes.,Double-Fun-1526,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/15c52a9/new_study_puts_indoeuropean_language_origins_in/,54,451,"Phys.org [article](https://phys.org/news/2023-07-insights-indo-european-languages.amp): New insights into the origin of Indo-European languages

""The authors of the study therefore proposed a new hybrid hypothesis for the origin of the Indo-European languages, with an ultimate homeland south of the Caucasus and a subsequent branch northwards onto the Steppe, as a secondary homeland for some branches of Indo-European entering Europe with the later Yamnaya and Corded Ware-associated expansions.  
  
""Ancient DNA and language phylogenetics thus combine to suggest that the resolution to the 200-year-old Indo-European enigma lies in a hybrid of the farming and Steppe hypotheses,"" said Gray.""

This seems to make sense and builds on most of the consensus we have had. Language and genetic origins always seem mobile and slowly changing. People move. Language evolves and builds new elements everywhere it goes. Pinning down and conceptualizing origins seems a bit fraught to me. It encourages us to oversimplify a dynamic process. "
