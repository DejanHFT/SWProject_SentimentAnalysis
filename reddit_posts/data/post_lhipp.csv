"Question about Intelligent Design and ""Artificial"" Selection (not the religious kind)",scopegoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/lhipp/question_about_intelligent_design_and_artificial/,7,0,"Hello!
I have been performing some thought experiments, and can't shake this idea of intelligence playing a role in evolution. Can you help me shed some light on the situation?

Point 1: The mind has the direct power to change the physical structure of the brain and the well-being of the body (Examples: Besides the infamous placebo effect, stress is also known causes horrific side effects in the body). If consciousness/subconsciousness has that power, how much of a stretch is it to say that it has access to genetic data, and the ability to modify or destroy it. Perhaps a subconscious ability to predict what a useful adaptation would be.

Point 2: Completely independent of my last point: we are intelligent beings that now have technological access to our genetic code and the ability to modify it with purpose. For example, gene therapy could be used in an effort to eliminate cancers. I know that we can't really predict 100% what a useful adaptation would be, but that wont stop intelligence from trying.
 
My Argument: If either of these points are true, then some form of intelligent control of our genetic code exists today. That means that natural selection isn't the only thing at play in evolution.


Even more compelling: what do we call it when humans start creating AI and artificial life forms? Isn't that intelligent design?


Possible counter point: I suppose one could argue that intelligence doesn't really have a large role in our cognition and that our thoughts are mostly subject to natural selective behaviors... which I think is a good argument, but I would disagree and have to do some more research on the topic.

Do you guys have any other good counter points, or insight into this phenomenon?

To clarify, I am not talking about the origins of the universe, religion, or any of that. Though it may be irrelevant, I happen to believe that intelligence is an emergent phenomenon.

Thanks in advance!"
