Should I explore London with a 15 hour layover?,saph26,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/v1y4z6/should_i_explore_london_with_a_15_hour_layover/,37,6,"Hi! I will be arriving to Heathrow Airport at around 5pm / 17:00. I have a 15 hour layover and was wondering if it's worth it to explore Central London? I would love to ideally walk around Buckingham Palace and make my way to the Tower of London. I'm not sure if this is too ambitious since I don't have a full day.

I've saw the underground tube takes at least 50 minutes to get to St. James Park Station. I know that the tube ends around midnight so I would only have about 5-6 hours to explore.

Do you think this is feasible or should I explore closer to Heathrow? I don't want to stay inside the airport for 15 hours :\\

Thank you!!"
