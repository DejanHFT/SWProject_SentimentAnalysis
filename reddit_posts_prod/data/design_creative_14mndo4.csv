Creative Agency Issues,Connect-the-Ducks,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/14mndo4/creative_agency_issues/,23,6,"I 37(F) currently work at a big creative agency and at  my wits end. I am a Associate Creative Director and have spent years  fine tuning my craft and learning along the way to get where I am today.  On the contrary, my peers working as an ACD & CD, some in their  late 20's a few in their early 30's, have been promoted too early and I  believe this is negatively affecting our agency. I have seen their work  and feel that they have inferior portfolios, deliver boring work, and  lack the design skill-set and eye that should be a mandate.This  frustrates me because I am having to work with them in a team, and this  is ultimately affecting efficiency and the caliber of work we are  delivering to our client. How can one be a creative director of any sort  without being able to do the design themselves?The other day I was  reviewing some creative work one of our designers produced and was  dumbfounded that our ACD selected crappy options to share with our  client when there were so many better options. How can an ACD be trusted  with gatekeeping when he/her hasn't developed their skill and eye?

Anyways,  enough ranting here, but what can someone in my position do to address  this issue and fight for better creative work? Have you been in this  situation before? Is this just common at every creative agency?"
