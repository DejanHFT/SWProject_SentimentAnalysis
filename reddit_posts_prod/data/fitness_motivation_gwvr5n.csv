"Are health problems from obesity completely reversed when you become normal/healthy, or do some health problems ""stay""?",Jaycub-Randy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/gwvr5n/are_health_problems_from_obesity_completely/,386,1920,"This seems like an easy question to answer via Google, but I can't seem to find anything.

Being obese at 16, and having started my weight loss journey quite recently, I've thought about this question a lot. Is it ""too late"" when It comes to certain health effects?



Edit: 
Thanks so much for the replies and for reaching out to me! I'm so thankful for the overwhelming amount of stories, motivation, and information. Love you all <3"
