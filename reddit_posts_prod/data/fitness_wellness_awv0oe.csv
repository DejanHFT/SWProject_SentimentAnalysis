Lightheaded while lifting well under max weight,uneducated_scientist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/awv0oe/lightheaded_while_lifting_well_under_max_weight/,17,19,A few weeks ago I exercised too hard and got dizzy and almost fell down. Since then whenever I lift I have to be extra cautious about getting dizzy. Usually by my fourth different exercise in my lifting routine I start to get dizzy and my heartbeat has sky rocketed. I don’t hold my breath. Before the incident this never happened. Did I possibly do some sort of damage or am I just stressing myself out about it and causing it by worrying too much. I can do 30 minutes on an elliptical with no problems. It just seems to happen when lifting. Anybody else gone through something like this? I am not the most fit individual but I want to get there. I’m hoping it will be pass as I lose more weight. Any thought?
