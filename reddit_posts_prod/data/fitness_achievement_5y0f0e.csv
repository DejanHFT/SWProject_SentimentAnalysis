My 5 Week Weight Loss Achievement - Pic and Plan I Followed,brad-the-impaler,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5y0f0e/my_5_week_weight_loss_achievement_pic_and_plan_i/,252,1620,"I posted around 6 weeks ago about any tips for shedding body fat over a 5 week competition. That topic was deleted by mods. However, I thought I should at least share my findings and experience in case anyone else wanted to go down this route. 

Firstly, I'll stick up the before and after picture.

Edit: I'm 36 and my height is 5ft 9in.

**Body Changes**

Starting weight 92.2kg / 14st 7lbs / 203lbs  
Finishing weight 81.1kg / 12st 11lbs / 179lbs  

*So a weight loss of 11.1kg / 1st 10lbs / 24.5lbs*

Fat % was measured with calipers and calculated based on bicep / tricep / front hip / shoulder blade measurements. (probably not the technical terms but you get the idea).

Fat % went from 29% to 19.9% a drop of 9.1%  
Waist 40.4in to 33.8in  
Arm Diameter 13.4in to 12.8in  
Leg Diameter 23.4in to 22.4in  

**The Plan**

The aim was to follow the plan set out by the people running this competition. This broke down into a diet plan to follow, exercise plans to follow, and classes you could attend. 

I had already been going to the gym myself, and kinda know what I'm doing. So I ignored their exercise plans and opted to just stick to the Diets they gave, and aimed to go to the gym and workout at least 5 times a week. If I missed the gym I'd go for a 3.8mile run (a route I have near my house that has very little incline)

**Diet Plan**

**Weeks 1 &amp; 2** Around 2170 calories / 168g protein  
*Breakfast*: 
Oats 80g | 
Banana | 
Honey | 
Protein Shake 1 scoop | 

*Lunch*: 
Brown Pitta Bread | 
John West Tuna Spring water 120g | 
Mixed salad green 1 cup | 
Mixed nuts 40g | 

*Dinner*: 
Broccoli and Cauliflower 80g | 
Rump Steak 200g | 
Brown Rice 100g | 

*After Workout*: 
Protein shake 1 scoop | 
apple | 

*Before Bed*: 
Cottage cheese 250g | 
Cucumber half cup | 
Mixed Nuts 40g |   

I opted to disregard the nuts out of this diet. I didn't feel that the high calorie content was worth it. I also didn't have the cotttage cheese. I felt better eating my evening meal, and then fasting until lunch the following day, where I would have my ""Breakfast"". Also 80g of porridge was way too much, so I had 40g.

**Week 3 &amp; 4** Around 1600 Calories / 150g Protein  
*Breakfast*: 
Oats 40g | 
Honey | 
Protein Shake 1 scoop | 

*Lunch*: 
John West Tuna Spring water 120g | 
Mixed salad green 1 cup | 
Mixed nuts 40g | 

*Dinner*: 
Broccoli and Cauliflower 80g | 
Rump Steak 200g | 

*After Workout*: 
Protein shake 1 scoop | 
apple | 

*Before Bed*: 
Cottage cheese 250g | 
Cucumber half cup | 
Mixed Nuts 40g |   

Again I ignored the nuts and the cottage cheese. 

**Week 5** Around 970 Calories  / 135g Protein  
*Breakfast*: 
Oats 40g | 
Protein Shake 1 scoop | 

*Lunch*: 
John West Tuna Spring water 120g | 
Mixed salad green 1 cup | 

*Dinner*: 
Broccoli and Cauliflower 80g | 
Rump Steak 200g | 

*After Workout*: 
Protein shake 1 scoop | 
apple | 

*Before Bed*: 
Cottage cheese 150g | 
Cucumber half cup |   

I ignored the cottage cheese and the vegetables. I wouldn't do this long term. I was aiming to knock my carbs out as much as possible this week with a view to my body falling back on fat reserves for fuel. So the only carbs I had were the oats for breakfast.

**Exercise Plan**

There was no set routine. I just worked as heavy as I could with good form, for a minimum of 4 sets per exercise, and 10-12 reps. One day I would do legs and chest. The next I'd do shoulders and upper back. The next lower back and core. It would be mainly free weights, with some machines. Minimal rest between sets and aim for a 30-40 minute window of exercise to fit in my lunch hour.

**Conclusion**

I lost far more weight than I thought I could. I thought a stone in weight would be a good aim, but this beat it by far. 

I felt energised throughout weeks 1-4 and had no trouble with my workouts. I didn't find the lack of food a problem, as quite honestly there wasn't a lack of food it was just much better quality food than I was used to putting in my body. 

I was eating less than the plans dictated as I didn't feel like I needed that much food. 

I found week 5 harder, but not hard. I found I'd go to bed earlier and sleep sounder in the last week. I'd also have to take extra rest between sets at the gym to keep the same intensity going. So gym sessions stretched to an hour. If I crouched for a while and then stood up, I'd get dizzy. But that was the only ""bad"" side effect I experienced. 

My mood, sleep patterns, drive, energy, skin condition all improved over the 5 weeks. I have slept better this last 5 weeks than I have anytime in the last 5 years. 

**Moving Forward**

I'm increasing my diet by 100 calories each week, and getting back to a normal calorie level. The thinking here is I want to reintroduce high volumes of food slowly so I don't pile the weight back on, and I also still have some remaining fat to lose so this should kill two birds with one stone. 

Any questions, ask away :)
