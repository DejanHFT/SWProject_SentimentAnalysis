Is it a bad idea for me to travel and explore one tiny country in detail?,monopolyporko,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/135juz7/is_it_a_bad_idea_for_me_to_travel_and_explore_one/,35,6,"Basically I'm in love with this one place and want to explore more of it even tho I've Seen most of it. I love the nature, the lifestyle, and the people there. There's so much to the place than we know. I want to go through every village town and river , and I still won't be bored of it. 

The catch is I might miss out on exploring other places. But at the moment I don't seem to mind it. I like slow travel. 

Will I regret it later ? Anyone been in a similar situation?"
