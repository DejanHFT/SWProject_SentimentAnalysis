What are the most uplifting musical moments for you?,Federico_95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/4bwpc1/what_are_the_most_uplifting_musical_moments_for/,57,38,"Mines are the main melody of [Summer by Joe Hisaishi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQRbAMb6LbI) and, even more, [Velocity Girl by Primal Scream](https://youtu.be/d8KynrRA1u8), which is a beautiful 82 concentration of pure bliss. It's a shame it doesn't last longer, but it would probably ruin part of its magic, so it's ok I guess :P

What about your preferences?"
