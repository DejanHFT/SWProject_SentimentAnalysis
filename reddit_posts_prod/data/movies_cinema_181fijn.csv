What was your introduction to “weird” cinema?,Ill-Assistance6711,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/181fijn/what_was_your_introduction_to_weird_cinema/,84,11,"If you’re into surrealist cinema, arthouse cinema or any other kind of cinema that general audiences would deem “weird.” Where did it all begin with you? 

I was born in 1994. When I was a kid, my favorite movies where “Back to the Future,” “The Mask,” “Disney’s Peter Pan,” Tim Burton’s two “Batman” films and “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie.” All of these films seemed normal to me when compared to a little movie I saw in 1998 called “The Fifth Element.” 

“The Fifth Element” was the the first time I can remember thinking of a movie as “weird.” With the outlandish colorful costumes, the over-the-top acting, the strange, overbearing behavior of the characters (“Gimme the CASH-SH-SH-SH-SH!”) and the general heightened reality of it all. This movie was weird as hell to me, and I loved every minute of it. Still do. 

Now of course “The Fifth Element” is pretty tame compared to the stuff I watch today, like “Eraserhead”, but still, it was my first dive into the strange pool, and it left a long lasting impression that I feel helped shape my taste in film going forward."
