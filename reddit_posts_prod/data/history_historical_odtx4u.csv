What’s your favorite historical legend?,spark8000,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/odtx4u/whats_your_favorite_historical_legend/,22,16,"Recently I’ve been fascinated with historical legends after I learned about the legend of the Hartlepool Monkey Hangers!

Basically the story goes that during the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century, a French warship sunk off the coast of the Northeastern British town of Hartlepool— with the sole survivor being a monkey dressed in a French military uniform. The townsfolk, having never seen a monkey nor a Frenchman before, believed the monkey to be a French spy. They brought it ashore and administered a trial, and when it refused to answer any questions (because it spoke French, duh) they hanged it for treason. To this day the people of Hartlepool are known as “Monkey Hangers” and their local football mascot is “H’Angus the Monkey!” 

That’s currently my favorite one, what’s yours?"
