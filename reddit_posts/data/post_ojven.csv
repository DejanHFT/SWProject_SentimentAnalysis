Help me name my restaurant!,Red_Clowd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ojven/help_me_name_my_restaurant/,2172,1057,"Very soon my family and I will be acquiring a restaurant that has filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  We will be reopening with the same staff and food but we can not open under the old name.  So does anyone want to help me brain storm some ideas for the new name?  It's an italian restaurant aimed at families.

Edit: Also if you wouldn't mind upvoting to help this thread gain a little visibility I would very much appreciate it.  Don't worry, self posts don't give me any Karma.

Edit 2: Wow this thread gained a lot more traction then I was expecting.  I keep getting a lot of you asking why the hell I would want to re open a restaurant that went bankrupt with the same food and staff so here is my answer from in the thread:

**Why the original place failed**

The short answer is embezzlement and misappropriating the money coming in. We've looked over the books for the past 6 months and the place is making a profit if the previous owner didn't have to pay back 3 different investors and the IRS. My family being the primary investors, something to the tune of 300 grand, we are taking the restaurant as compensation. The previous owner goes in 3 to 4 nights a week, drinks 1 to 2 bottles of wine (he has a serious alcohol problem) and then attempts to do the back end managing which has led to forgetting to pay things like the gas bill and the employees, etc. It didn't help that he was cartoonishly evil and dickish about the entire thing. 

**How I plan on fixing it**

I will be there every day to make sure the restaurant operates the way it's supposed to. I'll be paying our bills, our taxes and of course our employees. I plan on turning the work environment from hostile and tense to friendly and open. I've looked at our expenditures and already I can cut the over head down significantly. For example we'll be able to nearly halve food costs without sacrificing quality. I also am going to initiate a profit sharing incentive for our employees. We want them all to feel like they're a part of the bigger picture. Marketing...seriously the guy did zero marketing before and the place was still consistently busy. Even just a little bit for a small amount of money could pack this place. There are some more things but off the top of my head those are some of the bigger policy changes we're going to be implementing. Also, once I'm actually able to get in there running the day to day I'm sure more things will come to mind. 

**Because some people said &#3232;\_&#3232; at my claim of being able to cut food costs w/o skimping quality**

But my plan revolves around shrinking the menu down and eliminating some of our more expensive meals that don't get ordered a lot because a few days go by and that food is no good any more. It's about getting rid of a lot of food that is bought but never gets consumed. Like I said earlier, the place was terribly mismanaged and this was a problem that he didn't bother to fix. Also, I believe the initial projection that I ran by with our chefs put us closer to 40% then 50%.

**TL;DR** Previous owner was comically bad at what he did. I'll competently reform a few things and make sure the things that DID work are allowed to work.

**Final (Almost front page!? Seriously!? WTF!?) Edit:**

Sorry if I can't respond to everyone.  The comments are flying in so fast!  But believe me if you took the time to make a suggestion the very least I could do for you is read it.  I might not make it to them all today and according to Reddit I've been reading/responding to this thread for 11 hours straight already.  It looks like the thread has finally slowed down to a stop so I'm going to be going to bed and pick back up tomorrow morning.  Thank You everyone for bringing so much attention to not just the name but my situation as well.  I've received tons of great names and laughs as well as excellent critiques and advice when it comes to actually running a restaurant.  As the story might not have suggested to some people, being restaurant owners wasn't plan A for my family.  It's just our last hope to recoup a bad investment my father made a few years ago.  I'm well aware that I'm in over my head but I'm also just a guy trying to make lemonades out of the lemons that I've been given.  So again, thanks for all the help and support reddit!
