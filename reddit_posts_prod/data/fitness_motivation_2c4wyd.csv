Losing motivation after getting into a relationship,SouthernSmoke,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2c4wyd/losing_motivation_after_getting_into_a/,92,16,I've been going out with a girl for almost 4 months now and the motivation that I had before is fading. Sticking to my usual strict diet is also becoming harder to do. Anyone else have this same problem? What was your mindset to get back on track?
