"If I had to critique Andrew Dominik on ""Blonde""...",Chickens1,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/11nt5e5/if_i_had_to_critique_andrew_dominik_on_blonde/,7,0,"I would say the man knows how to turn 2 hours of content into a 3 hour movie, much to the hand wringing of the audience.   
  
I can live with the exploitation of a long dead very troubled woman, the gratuitous (though quite lovely) boobies, and the rather well interpreted versions of her two most famous husbands,  but there's a solid extra hour of dreamy montage shots that didn't really seem to be needed in the film.  
  
But that's my take."
