Inside (2023) review and discussion,NaiadoftheSea,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/11txeqd/inside_2023_review_and_discussion/,259,149,"Got to see the movie Inside last night, and I really liked it! The whole movie is a vibe and a meditation on the intrinsic nature of art and life.

Willem Dafoe is amazing as the main character, an art thief trapped in a luxury apartment that seals like a vault when his attempt to steal art from it goes awry. No running water, low on food, and no control over the thermostat, yet there's ample amounts of fine art everywhere to bring about inspiration, induce rage, and invoke madness.

I haven't stopped thinking about this film and what it had to say. On top of Dafoe's performance, the cinematography was gorgeous and provided storytelling of its own.

It may not be a movie for everyone, but it certainly spoke to me.

9/10
