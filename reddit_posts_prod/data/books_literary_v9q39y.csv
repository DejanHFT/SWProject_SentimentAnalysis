What literary trope drives you nuts?,korthlm,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/v9q39y/what_literary_trope_drives_you_nuts/,1547,2630,"For me, so many books have been ruined when the “independent, headstrong heroine” of the novel is actually a massive ditz. I love a story where the heroine is actually very smart and reflective and resourceful. She doesn’t have to be perfect. But she shouldn’t be characterized as an amazing warrior sage woman if she ONLY DOES THINGS THAT ARE THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. 

There are SO MANY books out there where it seems like the author tried to write their heroine in such a way, then realized the plot couldn’t work unless their smart girl inexplicably acted stupid for the whole novel. It just turns the whole story inside out!

There’s an entire series of popular books that I have in mind that fit this description… can’t figure out how to place the spoiler blackout text on mobile, though."
