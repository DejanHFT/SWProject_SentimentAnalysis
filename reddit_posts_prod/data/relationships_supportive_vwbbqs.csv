How do I(19M) become more supportive of my girlfriend(21F)?,OrangeYosh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vwbbqs/how_do_i19m_become_more_supportive_of_my/,10,8,"Relationship Length: Almost 8 months!! I like it and I love her.

My girlfriend is really into things like crystals and she take vitamins(which I believe are just placeboes) on top of her other licensed prescribed medicine that help with her ADHD and such. I am a very very logical person. My autism causes my brain to work in a way that needs proof for everything and is really REALLY annoying in a relationship. I'm working on it and she has helped me astronomically with understanding myself better and making me a better person. She means the world to me. I find myself sort of criticizing her hobbies(only like the crystals and stuff), because I don't personally believe in them. She's also into like supernatural things. My brain simply can't comprehend those sorts of things to be anything more than a fake joke or a placebo she's falling for. She cares about them though. And I really really want to be more supportive for her, because I know she deserves the world.

How do I become more supportive of her, even about things I don't personally believe in?

&#x200B;

TL;DR! I want to be better at supporting my girlfriend on things I don't believe in"
