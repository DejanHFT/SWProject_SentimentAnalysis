Do business people actually read business literature papers?,Inquation,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/zfvaql/do_business_people_actually_read_business/,16,11,"Hello, I have a background in computer science and I am currently undertaking a minor in entrepreneurship. They make us read papers about literally anything and it seems that anything we do or state has to be backed up by some paper. 

Therefore, I was wondering if in practice entrepreneurs and business people actually read papers when they want to make decisions or is it just some academic practice that will fade away once one is in the real world?"
