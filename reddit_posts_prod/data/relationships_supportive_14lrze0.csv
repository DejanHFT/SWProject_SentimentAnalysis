Supporting your partner in their business,ment_ins,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14lrze0/supporting_your_partner_in_their_business/,9,1,"TL; DR My fiancé (29m) thinks it’s okay for him to tell me he doesn’t think my (26f) business is going to succeed because of the name I’m choosing for it and says I should be okay with the truth and be mindful of my reaction.

Please be honest here. We have been together for about 2.5 years. Do you think it’s wrong for him to give his opinion on my business idea which is that is he doesn’t think the name is going to work and will hold business back for x y z. He said “it’s not going to work”, but he will still support and back me as what he thinks and believes is “irrelevant” He said what i think and believe is what matters that’s why he is still going to support me regardless of his own opinion. I think that is fake and he has to believe in the business to be able to support me. I think he’s wrong for saying he doesn’t think it’s going to work or succeed simply based on the name of the business, but still try to support me. The name is important but there are way more factors that can effect a business.

It makes me feel very upset that he thinks this after all this time. I’ve been working on this for months. I knew he didn’t like the name from the beginning, but to say the business is not going to succeed is bigger than “not liking the name” so what good does the support do? All this after I was having a conversation with him about how we can be a team and work together on this business and hopefully it will be profitable enough for it to become primary source of income. I know he just told me the truth and I don’t want him to lie, but he’s also telling me my reaction is uncalled for. He said I don’t need to be as upset as I am and cry about it. So this just makes it worse for me. Makes me feel like he doesn’t understand the gravity of what he said and how it can cause someone to be as upset as I got. It’s now going to make me feel weird asking him for help or advice and become a team because I’m going to think he doesn’t even believe in it."
