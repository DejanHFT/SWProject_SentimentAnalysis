Do yâ€™all have any cheap yet delicious breakfast recipes?,BigMac91098,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/eqkp91/do_yall_have_any_cheap_yet_delicious_breakfast/,77,23,"I love to cook, but I have a microscopic budget for food. I have some affordable lunch and dinner recipes, but I usually just fry eggs for breakfast (if I have time to cook). Is there an easy way to make eggs more interesting? Are there other cheap options?"
