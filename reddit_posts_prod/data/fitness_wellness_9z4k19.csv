Why do you eventually stop putting on muscle if you keep training well and eating a caloric surplus?,Bellgard,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9z4k19/why_do_you_eventually_stop_putting_on_muscle_if/,34,19,"You don't see arbitrarily large (especially low body fat) people walking around, so clearly at some point it becomes impossible to keep adding muscle.  I'm curious to know though, what actually happens to limit you once you hit that point if you keep doing ""everything right""?

If someone maintains a perfect unbroken habit of intense training, sufficient rest, sufficient protein, and caloric surplus, what happens when they max out muscle?  Do all the calories just go to fat no matter how hard they train?"
