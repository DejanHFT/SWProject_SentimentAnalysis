"Thought their parents were supportive, turns out it's codependence. Advice, please!",kaleidoscopicfailure,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ocwnna/thought_their_parents_were_supportive_turns_out/,5,2,"I (33) have been dating my partner (30) for nearly two years. My partner moved home prior to us dating to payoff debt. However, I'm concerned their relationship with their parent is unhealthily codependent.

The flags were there most of the relationship, but I downplayed them as them having supportive parents. I have a toxic family, so I thought maybe this is how a normal family was. 

It's to the point their parents provide food, housing, supplement their income, and pay for their cell phone. They had a med change recently that has a minor side effect and suddenly their parents drove them everywhere for 2 weeks. 

Any time they try to rope me I'm to what, at this point, I consider codependence, I politely decline. Most recently my partner brought up that I am so busy, they don't feel like a priority. During the conversation, when they vocalized this they immediately retracted it because they realized how it sounded. Basically they said that they are less of a priority to things I need to survive (job, medical, tending to offspring). I don't socialize except with family and even then it's for a few hours per month. All other time is open to spend time with them. 

At this point, I am concerned that not only will I be unable, but also unwilling, to fulfill the role of their parents if our relationship becomes more serious and we move in together. Additionally, I do not want their parents to continue with that level of codependency if we live together.

Do I talk to them about this? Is this something humans recover from when its brought to their attention? Am I better off ending the relationship on good terms and just cite my, in their words, ""busy life""?

TLDR; Partner has a codependent relationship with their parents, doesn't seem aware, or bothered by it. I'm concerned about progressing in the relationship because I am unwilling to meet that ""need"" and don't want to date their parents. Should I bring this up or end the relationship?"
