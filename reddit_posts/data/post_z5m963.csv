"I'm doing a 12th Year ""Research Paper"" working with Kepler Data, but I feel my Research Question is too plain. Looking for your Advice",JonVirtue,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/z5m963/im_doing_a_12th_year_research_paper_working_with/,3,7,"&#x200B;

I'm doing a HS 12th year ""research project"" done by all 12th graders in my country where you produce something akin to a ""research paper"". For my project I wanted to work with photometry and Kepler data. However, I have ran into a bit of a conundrum in that what I have right now feels a bit too general.

&#x200B;

What it currently involves is me doing noise reduction, processing and analyzing data on a system and then presenting the candidates I can find with estimates for their orbital period, and radii. 

I feel like this doesn't give me much to talk about in my discussion section due to the fact that my ""research question"" is basically ""what does this already collected data say about this system and its possible constituents if I process it?""

&#x200B;

I've had someone suggest that I look at a planet-metallicity correlation but I feel like an issue there is that I would need a sample of hundreds of stars. If I'm to still have me doing the data processing be a significant part of the project then that doesn't seem very feasible.

&#x200B;

Would anyone  of you have any advice or know of something I could look at for my research question?

Here's a couple of projects by former students I found online for reference:
