Making melodies using only using online resources.,FrugFred,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/11femy2/making_melodies_using_only_using_online_resources/,1,0,"Hello! I am new to the music scene, but recently got inspiration to make a song to try it out. I don't have any music experience, so it's likely gonna be a challenge.

Now I have an idea and a starting script wrote out about my ""first song"", but I don't know how to make a melody/beat, so I was wondering if any of you had a music software I could use to create it? I can't record anything irl except my voice, so I need to be able to make the entire thing through the software.

Also since this is just something I'm trying, I'd like for it to be cheap, around 20$ or less is my budget.

Also if anyone has some tips, feel free to let me know! I'm completely new so everything is apreciated."
