Concerns regarding heat of COB LED light strips in acoustic wall panels,RapeZz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/18zj31j/concerns_regarding_heat_of_cob_led_light_strips/,0,1,"I want to achieve something like this

The space in between the panels is fairly tight (12mm) and I would love to fit an RGBCCT or CCT COB strip in there. These strips are already \~10mm wide, so mounting it with an aluminium channel wouldn't be possible. I still want to cover it with a black see-through cover.

I am now concerned with the heat that those lights emit. Could this ruin the light strip or shouldn't I have to worry about it when mounting it directly onto the fabric?

If I need something to dissipate the heat, what could I use instead?"
