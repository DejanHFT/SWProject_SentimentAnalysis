This works so well!,Globe90Squatter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/i9yu8/this_works_so_well/,38,95,"I'd been looking for ways to somehow sneak in exercises during my everyday life without disrupting its flow. Here's what I found worked really well.

1.Buy a chin up bar

2.Put it up by the kitchen - or some entrance leading up to the kitchen

3.Tell yourself to do a set of ___ every time you walk through that entrance

Good way to discourage snacking too!"
