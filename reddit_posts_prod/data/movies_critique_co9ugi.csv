"""Ending Explained"" Videos getting out of control",Sir-Drewid,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/co9ugi/ending_explained_videos_getting_out_of_control/,139,506,"I recently sat down to watch the Netflix movie *I Am Mother.* I found it to be very enjoyable and wanted to find some more in depth discussions about its major themes online. Unfortunately, when I searched ""*I Am Mother* review"" the first page of results were all ""*I Am Mother* Ending Explained"" or a very similar variation thereof.

There are plenty of movies that might require multiple viewings to understand all the important plot points, *Primer* stands out in my mind. But *I Am Mother*, while being a great movie, was not difficult to follow. I can't tell if more moviegoers are having a difficult time following plots that aren't basic and full of exposition, or if ""Ending Explained"" is the new format that helps your review trend and I should just accept it.

It also doesn't help that a number of these video breakdowns miss the point of the story being told. Dan Olson from *Folding Ideas* has a great video that is a breakdown of the major themes for the movie *Annihilation*, while also acting as a friendly critique of the ""Ending Explained"" videos that surrounded it.

Edit:  
Whoops, forgot to include a link to that video. You should check it out, it's great.
