Design project on Astronomy,Metroinix,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/lmj2kl/design_project_on_astronomy/,0,8,"Hi everyone. Im a student in India doing IB MYP year 5 ( grade 10 ) . As my academic year is coming to an end, I need to undergo a 2 months design project where I help a certain community and solve one of their problems to increase synergy and connections between them. As one of my interest lies in astrophysics, I gravitated towards this community. I am planning to make a few posters explaining certain concepts like black holes and gravity, to tackle the problem of people dropping out of community as they cannot understand certain concepts easily. My posters will serve as a infographic explaining the concept to those who need help. To start, I need to prove the existence of the problem chosen.

For this , I have created a Google form with a few questions that will help me alot.  
Please take a small amount of your time to fill this form and share it with other people in this community. Please give this upvotes for recognition It would really help me and my grades. this is the common link for the form
