How to be supportive of boyfriend's day trading hobby/future endeavors?,rottiegal86,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nk1wst/how_to_be_supportive_of_boyfriends_day_trading/,7,0,"So my (35F) bf (37M) of almost a year starting getting into day trading specifically cryptocurrenies and has been contemplating quiting is 9-5 job and doing this full time. He beinh recognized and helping people through it as well. I understand his reasons for this change and want him to be happy doing what he loves. I try to be there for him and let him engage in his new interest as a hobby/side gig and he's seems to be really good at it and I'm proud of him for gaining this new skills set and helping people. 

The only issue I have with this newly found hobby is that he seems more preoccupied with trading around the clock and it's always on his mind. when we're spending time together, I know he's there with me physically but mentally is somwhere else or too absorbed into his hobby, checking his charts, his social media platforms regarding his trading, etc. 

We've had conversations about setting boundaries and having better time management around it but he gets upset and depressed saying that I'm not being understanding of what trading requires of him. He thinks I'm keeping him from his dreams and the ability to help people through this. But I'm not, I honestly just want him to be present and ""clock out"" not thinking about trading when we're doing things that need him to be both physically /mentally present with me and have him understand there's a time for everything in life. To me it seems like he's making his hobby a 24/7 thing and it bothers me because he doesn't make time for the things we used to do together and growing our relationship. He keeps saying he hates his current job and wants to retire early, pay off his debts through this new hobby and help people that's why he's giving so much attention to his trading. I totally understand this reasoning but so far its looking like  like he's sacrifing  his attention and I'm now is being pushed off to the side. 

So how can this be worked out between us when I want him to be happy and support him doing what he wants to do for his potential career change and at the same time not feel resentment for wanting him just to trade between a certain period of time and focus on other areas of out lives just like it would be if he were to work a 9-5 job?

TL;DR : Bf's trading hobby bothers me and I'm worried about our future together."
