Miso Soup from scratch is easy and delicious.,hellostarsailor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/840j81/miso_soup_from_scratch_is_easy_and_delicious/,53,357,"I made dashi last night and then, using the dashi, made miso soup from scratch today. 

It cost me $17 at the local H-Mart/Farmer’s Market, and about 2 hours of time, most of that spent simmering the konbu and wakame (the dried seaweed components).

And I have enough left over ingredients to make it about 20 more times.

I adapted Alton Brown’s dashi and miso recipe. I only used white miso and I bought a package of bonito flakes/flavoring that just dissolves like a stock cube. I’m sure real bonito would have a stronger umami flavor but it was good.

I hope this inspires someone else to try to make this easy and delicious dish."
