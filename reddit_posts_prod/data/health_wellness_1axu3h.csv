Can anyone give me advice on getting a job in workplace wellness?,MrPogonologist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/1axu3h/can_anyone_give_me_advice_on_getting_a_job_in/,1,0,"It's almost been a year since I graduated from college with a degree in Community Health Education. One of the areas I strongly gravitated towards was Workplace Wellness, so much so that I did an internship at a nearby children's hospital with their Wellness Manager.

I've been having a lot of trouble even finding jobs to apply for, and the ones I have sent my resume to haven't responded. Indeed and Career Builder just don't have many listings for Wellness Specialists, and the ones that do apply are asking for an RN.

Can anyone offer any advice? I'm becoming desperate."
