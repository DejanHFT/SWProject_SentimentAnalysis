New motivation,rambolonewolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37pwo3/new_motivation/,27,3,I have always wanted to lose weight but have had a hard time finding the motivation to do it for more than a few days or weeks. Finally I think I have what I need to do it forever. My dad had a heart attack Wednesday and I am seeing what it is doing to him at 63. The doctors say his other health conditions caused from smoking and diabetes may prevent him from getting the surgery he needs. Starting today I am going cold turkey from all the bad foods I used to eat and instead of energy drinks and pop it will be orange juice and water.
