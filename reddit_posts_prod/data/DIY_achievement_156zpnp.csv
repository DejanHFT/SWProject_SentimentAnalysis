Advice on how to achieve a smooth finish on these?,areyouimaginary,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/156zpnp,2,0,I have these two curved stool/nightstands that I wanted to fill in the cracks and eventually sand down to a smooth finish and repaint. Was considering using wood filler/ water putty but not sure what would be the best product as the gaps between the wood are quite deep. Open to aaany and all ideas!
