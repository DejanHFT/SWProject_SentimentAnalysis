artists and other creatives - what do you do when you get creative block?,xanaxnation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/dg3x7/artists_and_other_creatives_what_do_you_do_when/,26,9,"i used to paint pretty regularly, in addition to a few other creative type things. in the past ive formed an image in my head, worked on it and worked on it and eventually barfed it out on to canvass. but ive only done 2 paintings in over 2 years. when i try to think of an image, or sit and wait for one to come..... i feel empty. i havent really wanted to do any of my other creative stuff for a while too. im on a pretty high dose of effexor due to situational issues, im afraid its blunting my creativity but i know id go off my rocker if i lowered the dose right now. what helps you get past your block?"
