"20F had early pregnancy miscarriage, 21M boyfriend isn't supportive.",wchs9124,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1895km/20f_had_early_pregnancy_miscarriage_21m_boyfriend/,54,81,"My first throwaway post on reddit! Anyway, I've been with my boyfriend for about five months now. A month ago, I made the mistake of having unprotected sex with him (please don't lecture me, I think I've learned my lesson) and two weeks later had what my doctor thinks was a miscarriage. I'm currently in counseling for depression (for other reasons as well, not just the miscarriage but it certainly doesn't help) and have been having a lot of suicidal ideation.  So I'm obviously not in a great place.

Anyway, I told the boyfriend about everything and he has been incredibly unsupportive. Since I told him, he's been out getting hammered every night with his friends and I feel like he's avoiding me. We've been fighting a lot and he says a lot of really insensitive things. I don't expect him to help me through my depression, that's my own problem, but I didn't get pregnant by myself. I've never had unprotected sex with anyone else in my entire life and can't believe I was dumb enough to with him. 

I have tried talking to him about it and the longest conversation we've had was probably a little under 10 minutes and all he really said is that he doesn't like to think about it because he feels like he's having a mini panic attack. That's how I feel all the time. I understand that he needs to process this in his own way and doesn't know how, but I really don't want to (possibly even can't) go through this by myself.

I just have no idea what to do. I feel like I've tried to talk to him and it hasn't gone well at all. I do really like him, but the way he's handling this has made me feel so much worse about everything that I'm not sure I even want to keep dating him. I'm in a huge struggle just to process this miscarriage and my depression, I want someone who will either help me or get out of my way and all he's doing is hurting. Help?

tl;dr: Boyfriend knocked me up, I miscarried, he's been avoiding me, I don't know what to do.

EDIT: I think I should make it clear that this was a very unplanned pregnancy. Yes, I am glad that I'm no longer faced with the challenges of having a child at this age because that was definitely not in the plan. But it's still a miscarriage."
