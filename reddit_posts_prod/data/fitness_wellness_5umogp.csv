How well can I deadlift without squatting?,Widdles_P_Diddles,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5umogp/how_well_can_i_deadlift_without_squatting/,20,42,"I have a bad ACL (Severely sprained in 2014). I have tried during several periods to progress on squats and can't seem to get much past 150lbs without pain. I squat ATG. Considering just backing it off to parallel. Running doesn't typically hurt it.

However I recently have started deadlifting, and found it doesn't hurt my knee at all. They seem to work the same leg and core muscles, so I am wondering can I just deadlift without squatting, and if so, how far can I progress? I am currently deadlifting 2x per week (PPL program), adding 10 lbs each time workout. Today I did 1x5@175lbs, with 1x5 warmup sets of 135 and 155 respectively."
