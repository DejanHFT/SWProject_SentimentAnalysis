How can I write a story inspired by Berserk without basically copying it?,SadRerman,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/191iuxw/how_can_i_write_a_story_inspired_by_berserk/,11,0,"I want to make a manga and the world building is heavenly inspired by Berserk. Although maybe it would be a little more modern, with some steampunk elements. And magic would also be more common.
But otherwise it would play in a European medieval world like Berserk, also full of monsters. 
Even the main character is very similar to Guts. The problem is, I've always wanted to make a main character with a big sword, who fights monsters and is pretty much like Guts. But I didn't even know about Berserk back then so I'm not just copying him. Though compared to Guts, my character is a bit less confident and suffers from depression which will sometimes impact his life."
