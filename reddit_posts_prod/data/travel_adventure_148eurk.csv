G Adventures 18-30 somethings?,ckr2982,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/148eurk/g_adventures_1830_somethings/,21,5,"My wife and I are 38 years old, active and experienced travelers. We are looking to do a G adventures trip slotted for 18-39 year old's.  Are these trips mostly people in their early 20's? I feel like we wouldn't have much in common with a group that young and maybe are better off doing the ""classic"" version of the trip. Any experience/ input is apricated."
