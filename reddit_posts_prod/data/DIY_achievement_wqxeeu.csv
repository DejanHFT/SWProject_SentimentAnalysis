Custom Beer Pong Table Build,Spare-Office-7526,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/wqxeeu/custom_beer_pong_table_build/,13,70,"This is a full end to end build of a custom made beer pong table . This table is a gift for our brother/uncle James, for his 30th birthday! 

We wanted the table to:    
\- Be foldable ✅   
\- LED lights controlled by WiFi ✅   
\- Made from pallet wood ✅   
\- Be awesome!! ✅  

We achieved this and more and we love the table, and most importantly James loves it too!!
