> Critics consensus: A grim, gritty, and gripping super-noir, *The Batman* ranks among the Dark Knight's bleakest -- and most thrillingly ambitious -- live-action outings.

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** 

> With his Planet of the Apes installments, Matt Reeves demonstrated that big studio franchise movies based on iconic screen properties didn’t have to exclude intelligent, emotionally nuanced storytelling. The same applies to The Batman, a brooding genre piece in which the superhero trappings of cape and cowl, Batmobile and cool gadgetry are folded into the grimy noir textures of an intricately plotted detective story. Led with magnetic intensity and a granite jawline by Robert Pattinson as a Dark Knight with daddy issues, this ambitious reboot is grounded in a contemporary reality where institutional and political distrust breeds unhinged vigilantism.

-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/batman-robert-pattinson-1235100390/)

> Where do you go after “The Dark Knight”? Ben Affleck blew it, and even Christopher Nolan, who brought unprecedented levels of realism and gravitas to that franchise-best Batman saga, couldn’t improve on what he’d created in his 2012 sequel. So what is “Cloverfield” director Matt Reeves’ strategy? Answer: Go darker than “The Dark Knight,” deadlier than “No Time to Die” and longer than “Dune” with a serious-minded Batman stand-alone of his own. Leaning in to those elements doesn’t automatically mean audiences will embrace Reeves’ vision. But this grounded, frequently brutal and nearly three-hour film noir registers among the best of the genre, even if — or more aptly, because — what makes the film so great is its willingness to dismantle and interrogate the very concept of superheroes.

-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2022/film/reviews/the-batman-review-robert-pattinson-matt-reeves-1235188970/)

> It was less than three years ago that Todd Phillips’ mid-budget but mega-successful “Joker” threateningly pointed toward a future in which superhero movies of all sizes would become so endemic to modern cinema that they no longer had to be superhero movies at all. With Matt Reeves’ “The Batman” — a sprawling, 176-minute latex procedural that often appears to have more in common with serial killer sagas like “Se7en” and “Zodiac” than it does anything in the Snyderverse or the MCU — that future has arrived with shuddering force, for better or worse. Mostly better.

-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/02/the-batman-review-2022-1234702878/): B

> The Batman is a gripping, gorgeous, and, at times, genuinely scary psychological crime thriller that gives Bruce Wayne the grounded detective story he deserves. Robert Pattinson is great as a very broken Batman, but it’s Zoe Kravitz and Paul Dano who steal the show, with a movingly layered Selina Kyle/Catwoman and a terrifyingly unhinged Riddler. Writer/director Matt Reeves managed to make a Batman movie that’s entirely different from the others in the live-action canon, yet surprisingly loyal to Gotham lore as a whole. Ultimately, it’s one that thoroughly earns its place in this iconic character’s legacy.

-[Alex Stedman, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-batman-review-robert-pattinson): 10 ""masterpiece""

> So, yes, “The Batman” is absolutely too long, and it has more than enough self-seriousness to match. But Reeves takes an unusual risk in the era of endless mythologies and cinematic universes by telling a story that actually could be complete, even if it’s also obviously meant to be the beginning of a larger narrative. If intellectual property exists precisely because people become compelled to invest themselves over and over in the journeys of these characters, then “The Batman” not only delivers the goods, it also embodies many of the reasons why that investment can feel so rewarding.

-[Todd Gilchrist, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/the-batman-review-robert-pattinson-zoe-kravitz/)

> Matt Reeves’ arrival in the Bat-verse is a gripping, beautifully shot, neo-noir take on an age-old character. Though not a totally radical refit of the Nolan/Snyder era, it establishes a Gotham City we would keenly want a return visit to.

-[John Nugent, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-batman/): 4/5

> Matt Reeves’ film is spectacular and well-cast but an intriguing saga of corruption devolves into a tiresome third act.

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/28/the-batman-review-robert-pattinson): 3/5

> The two stars generate an astonishing sensual charge in a brilliant addition to the Batman canon that refuses to behave like a blockbuster.

-[Robbie Collin, The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/batman-review-robert-pattinson-zoe-kravitz-seduce-sinuous-un/): 5/5

> I know there will be plenty of people who feel they are burned out on all things Batman. That there couldn't possibly be room for yet another retelling of this same old tale. But ""The Batman"" defies the odds. It's epic, mythic, pulpy blockbuster filmmaking at its best. 

-[Chris Evangelista, /FILM](https://www.slashfilm.com/780391/the-batman-review-the-dark-knight-returns-in-what-may-be-the-best-bat-movie-yet/): 9/10

> Director Matt Reeves’ ambitious and excellently crafted “The Batman” more than justifies its existence as a world-building wonder that slathers a realistic grime across its Gotham City, a metropolis filled with familiar yet refreshing takes on its iconic coterie of heroes and villains. And at the center of it all is Robert Pattinson, the latest actor to don the famous cape and cowl, who brings a grungy, broody brawn to an emotionally conflicted Caped Crusader.

-[Brian Truitt, USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/02/28/the-batman-movie-review-robert-pattinson-excels-new-dark-knight/6931207001/): 3.5/4

> It falls on Pattinson's leather-cased Batman to be the hero we need, or deserve. With his doleful kohl-smudged eyes and trapezoidal jawline, he's more like a tragic prince from Shakespeare; a lost soul bent like a bat out of hell on saving everyone but himself.

-[Leah Greenblatt, Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-batman-review-robert-pattinson/): B

> The Batman, then, is a unique commemoration of the Batman mythology and its stylistic and tonal shifts across its 80-year history. But more than its respect and affection for that mythos, the film stands apart for thoughtfully suggesting that our hero might actually one day make his city a better place, and not merely a safer one.

-[Jake Cole, Slant](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/the-batman-review-robert-pattinson-matt-reeves/): 3/4

> Batman has a long history of provoking passionate reactions and debate, and the latest entry will be no exception. In Pattinson, the producers have found a Dark Knight worthy of the hoopla, while creating a Gotham much in need of him. As new chapters go, it's a strong beginning; if only it had known when to end.
