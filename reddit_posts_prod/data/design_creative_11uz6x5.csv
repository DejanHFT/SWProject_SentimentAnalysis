Why can't I open a shop on Creative Market?,KozmoRobot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/11uz6x5/why_cant_i_open_a_shop_on_creative_market/,5,3,"I have a situation where I was sending many requests for opening a shop on Creative Market, that is linked to my Dribbble account. Unfortunately, when I got an e-mail telling that ""Creative Market has decided to pass on my shop request"", I can no longer send shop requests, when I go to the page where I usually send requests, I get an error message ""Whooomp, there it isn't..."", which is making me quite frustrated because I cannot open a shop on this platform. I wanted to open a shop on Etsy but there is no option for Serbia, which is where I live, so I decided to go to Creative Market, but didn't know I will fall into this situation.

Is there any way to get out of this situation?"
