Supplement Thursday,AcesulfamePotassium,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/27dqk1/supplement_thursday/,598,159,"Welcome to another week for Supplement Thursday. Like usual, any question can be asked despite a guiding question being given. This week's guiding question is:
> What supplement do you take that you feel makes the biggest difference in your fitness, physique, or overall wellness?

And of course before asking any questions, make sure the FAQ/Wiki haven't answered you already! Thanks!

Edit: Man I'm fucking sick of telling you guys about creatine! If you're going to ask a creatine question, [check here first](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/27dqk1/supplement_thursday/chztt35) and make sure that doesn't answer it."
