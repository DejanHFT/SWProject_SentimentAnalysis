Minimalist and adventurous trips? Ideas welcome.,Jaaay19,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/156xoqq/minimalist_and_adventurous_trips_ideas_welcome/,18,7,"I am becoming increasingly thirsty for a real adventure! 
This time next year I will (hopefully!) have the time and money to go away for a good while. 
From UK, so am well-travelled in Europe and looking further afield.   

I’m looking for a minimalist trip where you feel away from home comforts and can really feel pleasantly disconnected from modern life (and the internet). I like to push my comfort zone so don’t mind a rough sleep or 2, but at the same time don’t really want to get lost in the Amazon for 5 months… Naturally coming to mind is some sort of Wild camping/hiking trip maybe as a group, but I don’t want to be with people who just want to go on the trip to show everyone on instagram they’ve been on a trip…

Has anyone had any adventures like this they recommend? Or companies that offer such? Where you come back a little tired but refreshed and with a  newfound appreciation for everything you have back at home? 
Thanks in advance!"
