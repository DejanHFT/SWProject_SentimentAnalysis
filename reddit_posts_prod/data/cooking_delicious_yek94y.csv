1- Cut some potatoes in half and season them with salt, pepper, rosemary, thyme, and a splash of oil. Line them on a baking tray and pop them in a preheated oven at 400℉ for 45 minutes.

2- Once done, set your potatoes aside and bake your asparagus for eight minutes.

3- Put the fish on the grill. Rub the protein with minced garlic and place it skin-side-down on a bed of thinly sliced lemons. Roast it for 15 minutes at 450℉, flipping it on between.

4- Combine melted butter and lemon juice in a bowl and pour it over the freshly baked fish and veggies."
