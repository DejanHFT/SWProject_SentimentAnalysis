Best carribean destination for local food and easy exploring?,kaps84,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18kzdcz/best_carribean_destination_for_local_food_and/,2,2,"My husband and I have 7 days (Mar 2-9, very hard dates due to childcare) to go somewhere for my 40th. I'm leaning towards not an all inclusive as we both love food and I want to try allllll the things. Looking to spend ~$6500 including air, hotel and food. Flying out of Chicago, so lots of options.

We have only been to Jamaica and do not want to go there again. Please help! Here are the ""requirements"":

- Nice beach(es)
- No more than 5/6 hour flight, preferably nonstop
- local food we can try, we'll try anything. I like fruity drinks, husband is an IPA and whiskey drinker. 
- Safe for tourists,  perhaps a resort or villa that will help us with a driver or transport?

Other than that I am 1000% open minded but prices are going up and I need some ideas!"
