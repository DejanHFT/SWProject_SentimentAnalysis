"Topic: Songs you started off hating, but then LOVING.",Guitar_Mayhem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/18ifs7z/topic_songs_you_started_off_hating_but_then_loving/,161,115,"The title is as it says: what are songs you all hated on your first listen but ended up loving as time passed with repeated listens?

For me, the best example I could give is **""Float On""** by Modest Mouse. I was very young when I first heard this song, and for some reason I couldn't STAND IT. Maybe it was the jangly, marching-band beat, or the pokey vocals trying to sound happy, but I always skipped the track whenever I hear the guitar-riff kick in. Overtime though, as my taste in music became more diverse, and I ended up going through tough times, I would let this track play and listening to it more carefully, it turned out to be an uplifting song with a hint of irony that did not leave me feeling patronized or talked-down to by the end as most ""happy songs"" tend to do. I began appreciating the musicianship on this song to and it ended up being one of my all-time favorite songs."
