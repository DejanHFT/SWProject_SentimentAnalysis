Black Sabbath and Interesting Vocal Melodies,Fostex350,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/t2gi43/black_sabbath_and_interesting_vocal_melodies/,3,3,"Hey all, 

Recently dove into some Black Sabbath and find myself really digging Ozzy's melodic choices. While the compositions are rich with blues concepts and color, wanted to know if there was any analysis of his vocals? How is he able to ride the song in such a spooky eerie way? Specifically, I'm referring to songs like [this,](https://youtu.be/4g_Yk6eKlwk) and even [this](https://youtu.be/uk_wUT1CvWM). Sounds to me like his vocals seem to stick to one note mainly. Maybe he's focusing on a creepy interval in the given key? Tritone or Minor Second?"
