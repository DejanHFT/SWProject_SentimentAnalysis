"For those whose interest in space and space flight lead them to a career in engineering, aerospace or astronomy: when did you know you wanted to pursue that path?",jordanexplores44,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/17xny3d/for_those_whose_interest_in_space_and_space/,2,2,"I’m currently considering aiming for a degree in some form of engineering. While I want a stable career and set of skills I could take anywhere, I’d love to someday be apart of what space agencies do and be a part of building spacecraft in the aerospace industry. But I’m not sure if I should take an interest of mine like this and take it to a career level. Any advice or just stories of your own paths would be great and much appreciated."
