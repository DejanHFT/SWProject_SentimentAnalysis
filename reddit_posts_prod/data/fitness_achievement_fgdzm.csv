askFitness: Achieving the Unachievable: How realistic are your goals? ,Leviathan_86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/fgdzm/askfitness_achieving_the_unachievable_how/,72,14,"I know the current trend on reddit fitness  is either weight loss or strength gain. While there was I time I wanted to be stronger than a superhero, I am also motivated by purely cosmetic reasons. 

**This is me vs my goal **

* 1) How many of you are faced with impossible challenges? 
* 2) What are you all after? 
* 3)To what extent will you go to pursue your goal? 
* 4) How many years have you dedicated? 
* 5) What is your motivation? 

I have put about 8 years (currently 24) only made progress the last 3 years. Its a long and frustrating road. But it does keep me going. 

Lets hear your targets. 

**Sadly, after all these years I seek reddit for motivation. Anyone else going through the same phase? **
