Games you were excited for but ended up disappointed,Particular-Season905,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/16op97b/games_you_were_excited_for_but_ended_up/,162,0,"For me, that's Dead Space (2023). I love Resident Evil games a lot, but I just couldn't get myself to enjoy Dead Space. It wasn't scary to me (I've played too many horror games in my life), and I just wasn't having fun. I was just sitting there, blank face, no reaction to anything happening. I really don't know why"
