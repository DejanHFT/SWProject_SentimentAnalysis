I made a mess of my front door jam and need suggestions to fix,raveJoggler,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/19etwss/i_made_a_mess_of_my_front_door_jam_and_need/,2,3,"I installed an electronic deadbolt and ran into the issue that the door has to close *perfectly* in order for it all to work.  This means that when closed, the latch needs to be fully engaged *and* the deadbolt needs to be perfectly lined up.  No room for needing to put pressure on the door to get it to line up since it needs to be able to lock without pressure.  

In order to achieve this I had to move the latch strike plate down - however that moved it *into* the previous gap, which means that there's no way for me to secure a screw on it.  What can I do?

[Here's a picture of the issue](https://imgur.com/a/CamGxAB).  With this setup the door closes pretty well, but I can't fully secure the bottom strike plate."
