My Terrifying Syria Adventure,pretzelcuatl,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3tdy5r/my_terrifying_syria_adventure/,20,180,"Many years ago, long before 9/11/01, when I was 20, my girlfriend and I went to London to get the cheapest flight to India, which turned out to be with Syrian/Arab Air.  The flight stopped over in Damascus, where we changed planes.  It was the first time I saw soldiers in an airport with machines guns -- they were everywhere.  We wound up in a long line at the gate, and noticed a lone Arabic guy, probably 25, who took a VERY keen interest in me.  When I took out my U.S. passport his eyes bugged out, but he controlled himself when he saw us looking.  We got nervous, wondered if we should tell someone, or not get on the flight, SOMETHING.  But what could we do?

We boarded and chilled.  Then the SAME GUY took the seat next to me.  He pretended that nothing had happened, but I was petrified, tried not to look at him.

The flight got underway, and I made small talk with my girlfriend.  Suddenly he tapped my shoulder.  Of course I jumped, but turned and tried to act natural.

He tentatively asked me, in heavily accented English:  ""You are American?""

I know some people say to always claim to be Canadian, but I don't play that way, and in any event, he had seen my passport.

""Yes, yes I am.""

He nodded, seemingly pleased.

Then more confidentially, he asked, ""Do you like [hwem]?""

""Um, [hwem]?""

""Yes, [hwem]!""

""Uh, I'm not really sure what that is...""

Brimming with excitement, he went for his bag.  I tensed up, then he pulled out a huge collection of cassette tapes, recordings by the pop group ""Wham"".

""Wham, Wham, right?"" he asked. ""You know Wham?""

I felt like such a dick.

""Oh, yeah, Wham!  Yes!  Great band...""

He was SO passionate about this.  ""I LOVE Wham!  They are the greatest music.  America is such a wonderful country...""

And etc. and etc.  Totally nice guy.  We were both so embarrassed...

I have since travelled the world pretty extensively, including in a few muslim countries, with generally positive and universally eye-opening experiences.  Since 9/11, however, and the recent events in France, I've been pretty disillusioned about the state of things, at times bordering on xenophobia when I look at what is happening in Europe.  I'm all for freedom of religion, though I have none of my own, but I would feel very uncomfortable to know that my local population was about to dramatically swell with people whose world view is so contrary to my own.

But:  the crisis in Syria does also remind me of my one moment of terror in that country, and the degree to which that fear was self-created on my part through lack of understanding the human standing right next to me.  It makes me more grateful than ever that I have been fortunate enough to see and experience so many parts of the world that are becoming less and less accessible, or must at least seem that way to the new generation of travelers.  Anyone who is torn between staying with a boring job vs. taking a risk and seeing the world should always do the latter, no matter what."
