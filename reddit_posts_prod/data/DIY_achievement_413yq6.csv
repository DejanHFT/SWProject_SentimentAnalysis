How to achieve a faux chiseled wall finish?,rbaile28,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/413yq6/how_to_achieve_a_faux_chiseled_wall_finish/,13,27,"This is more of an exploratory question but the look I'm wondering about it [this one](http://www.bulleit.com/images/background/out/2048/bulleit-bourbon-visit.jpg). 

It would be purely aesthetic and only inside. Seems like something along the lines of a vacuform panel and/or hand carving out of foam would be a fairly easy approach. 

Is chiseled even the right word? Mined? Excavated? How is this accomplished in the real world with real stone?

So short of building an evil layer 40ft underground, how would you tackle this?"
