Should I be supportive on my Unemployed bf(28y) to do his music and movie and got angry when I asked about his future plan?,Visual-Lack-2711,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/sp6nq6/should_i_be_supportive_on_my_unemployed_bf28y_to/,11,2,"My unemployed boyfriend (28y) living on unemployment subsidy got pissed when I asked about his future plans and got deeply emotional and depressed when his subsidy got cut half.

My boyfriend is unemployed and using all his money to do flipping(buying cheap instruments and selling them in a higher price) and buying expensive devices to make a movie and music. He worked at a restaurant before the pandemic and haven’t got a job for two years. Only worked as part time for a few months in the whole year. We have been together for almost a year and his bank account is always in single digit number. He lives in a house bought by his family alone. I (28y)worked full time with a saving. I live alone in a rented apartment. I sometimes help him get the groceries and share half of his groceries to help him a bit. I lend him a few hundred to help as well. Whenever he gets money he will use it up quickly by getting takeaway or buying more for flipping online but he seldom resell the product he got. 

Few days ago I had to leave his house to go home because he didn’t have the money to top up the gas and I was starving and I cannot lend him money anymore. He said I shouldn’t be upset because I will get food when I go back to my place and him being broke doesn’t affect me at all. 

Two days ago I asked him in a call what do you see yourself doing in 5 years? He said what about you? I said well I will see myself getting a house and if I got lucky maybe a family. Then he replied saying he will finish his movie and put it on the cinema. And then what? Well I will start a production company.Then I asked where will you get the money? He instantly asked what is that tone? I fee uncomfortable with you interrogating me like this can we talk in another time? Then he hang up on me. 

He texted me raging how could I talk to him in this aggressive tone when he told me he was depressed few hours ago because the job center cut half of his unemployment subsidy. I apologized for the tone I had which I don’t really had any tone, it was a plain question. I explained to him I want to see if our relationship will be going anywhere if he doesn’t have any saving or plan because I am planning to buy a house and start a family with my own money and I cannot support him in the future if he is still jobless. All my friends ask me to break up with him because he is lazy and such a loser to vent his anger on my concern. I am here asking if I should be supportive and not panicking about future?

tl;dr my unemployed bf doesn’t have a job nor saving and gets angry when I asked him about his future plan."
