What's your Favorite Historical Misconception?,herebemonstersmusic,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3r4stc/whats_your_favorite_historical_misconception/,371,155,"So I'm writing a song about things we don't understand (or things we misunderstand) about history and I wanted to know what some of your favorites are. I've still got a couple of lines available, so if you've got a really good one, I may try to include it. To give you an idea of what to look for, some of my favorites include: 

1. Thoreau didn't live in isolation.
2. Marie Antoinette never said ""let them eat cake."" 
3. Napoleon wasn't actually short.

I look forward to seeing what you've got, r/history!!!"
