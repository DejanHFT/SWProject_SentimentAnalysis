Why are strategy mobile games so bloated?,PerroRosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/18qmbfg/why_are_strategy_mobile_games_so_bloated/,50,227,"There are countless mobile games out there with actual fun battles. But the rest of the game is a sea of confusing upgrade mechanisms, infinite badges, rewards, million different screens, constant prompts rushing you to do things, kind of complicated resources management, etc.

Obviously I expect a strategy game to have some degree of complexity. But these seem to be pushing that to absurd levels.

It there a reason for this? Stretching the play time as much as they can? Does anyone enjoy these games long enough? I end up uninstalling all of them pretty much right away.

EDIT:

All good answers. My question should have been more specific though. I know 'money' is the answer to pretty much anything a company does. But I was more curious about how this strategy in particular increases the chances of a player spending money. "
