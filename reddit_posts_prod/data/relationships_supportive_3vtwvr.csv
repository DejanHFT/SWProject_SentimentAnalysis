"My twin brother (26m) wrote a book about our family and now he's getting offers for publication. I (26f) want to be supportive but it uncovers a lot of ""family secrets"" and I'm terrified for our siblings' reactions.",bookfam,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3vtwvr/my_twin_brother_26m_wrote_a_book_about_our_family/,89,630,"I will try to keep this brief as can be. I am very proud of my brother and excited for him, this is an absolutely massive break for him and opens up a lot of doors. He picked up an agent and has several offers on the table from great companies who want to publish his memoir.

He has changed all of the names in the book except for his own. Some backstory: we are the youngest of 4. We share a mom with our two older siblings (38m and 36f) but have a different dad. My older siblings' dad is bipolar and had a bad addiction for many years while they were young. Our siblings have struggled throughout their lives with addiction, financial problems and mental health issues. It's been speculated that my brother may have borderline personality disorder, bipolar, or a mix of both. My sister has been diagnosed with BPD and she's been in therapy for many years, and has recognized a lot of her wrongdoings.

So, our history is a bit strange. My mom was married to their dad for many years, they eventually divorced and she raised my half-siblings on her own for a long time. Then she met our dad and had my brother and me. They stayed married until we reached age 9. By this point our half-siblings were just a nightmare for my dad, constantly rebelling because they hated him and any time he tried to discipline them since he was not their real father. Behind the scenes, their dad was encouraging this sort of behavior and would constantly argue with our mom in their defense. My siblings broke furniture, glass, punched holes in the walls, got into screaming fights almost daily, and a slew of other fucked up things that might've gotten them kicked out in other households. Instead, my dad reached a breaking point and my parents separated/divorced, and that was the end of that.

So after that things just got worse and worse. My brother and I witnessed a lot of blowouts between my older siblings and mom and were often asked to step in, take sides. My half-siblings treated my mom terribly at this time because they had so much anger toward her. They were abusive to all of us verbally and on one occasion that ended with the police being called, my older sister got into a physical fight with my twin brother and he ended up with stitches.

Okay, getting a little too deep there -  point is, shit was always going nuts in our young adulthood and it impacted my brother and I in a lot of negative ways. Finally we moved out and my mom got some help. My siblings live with their dad and have mellowed out a lot. They've apologized over the years, my sister especially since the therapy, but since still they are not easy to be around mainly because of all the resentment my brother and I have toward them, and we tend to keep our space except for holidays, etc.

Long story short, they don't know that my brother has been writing about them for ages, since he first found his talent. And now he has this incredible and painful book and wants to publish it, and I'm freaking out about the reaction my siblings, my mother, and my siblings dad will have. Even though their names are changed, they will obviously know who my brother is talking about/referring to in every section, and I can't even fathom their rage. My sister in particular is HUGE on ""family privacy."" Once, she looked at my diary and found out I had shared some things about her to a close friend (i was 17). She has never been more furious and hateful and still brings it up as the most unforgivable thing I ever could have done. She and our older brother are in full agreement that what happens in the home stays in the home and it's none of anyone else's business.

Alternatively, my twin brother is adamant now that even though he feels a little bad/nervous, this is also HIS story and he is allowed to share it however he wants. Which makes total sense to me! Still, I'm afraid of many thing with my siblings' reaction, since this is the ultimate betrayal. I know they are capable of a lot of very awful things when angry and I am nervous of how they may take to social media to declaim his memories or interfere with his personal life. I also feel guilty because since they have ""calmed down"" and apologized so many times, I don't know how they'll react knowing that my brother still exposed them. This is made worse by the fact that my sister has been in therapy and recognizes her past abuse. And lastly I'm nervous for my brother, because while I know all of the memories he has in there are 100% true, our older brother's versions of the past is very different now, and he will deny everything and believe it actually never happened.

---

I'm bracing myself to take my brother's side, since I'm sure my siblings will be furious with me regardless. But what else can I do? I don't think it'd be right to convince him not to publish, but I really don't know. Is there anything that we can do to help smooth things over? 
   
**tl;dr**: Twin wrote a book about my family and our experiences with their abuse, but now that he is about to publish I am very nervous for the reactions and the mess that this will stir up. "
