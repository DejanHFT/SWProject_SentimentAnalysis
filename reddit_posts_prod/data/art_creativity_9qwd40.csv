Understanding Digital Art and Digital Creativity,shagminer,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/9qwd40/understanding_digital_art_and_digital_creativity/,3,4,"I am a painter and these days do acyrilics on canvas. I start with a blank canvas and add paint. But when it comes to looking at digital, I realize that I do not know if you start with a blank screen and progressively draw objects and color fields, or if you start with a photograph and modify that - or is it both or neither. Everyone knows what the painter does but how many know what the digital artist does - apart from sitting at the computer? It would help to appreciate the work more if we understood a little more of how it is made."
