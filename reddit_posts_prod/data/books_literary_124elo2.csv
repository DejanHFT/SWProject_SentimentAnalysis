The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society,carrotwhirl,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/124elo2/the_guernsey_literary_and_potato_peel_pie_society/,33,76,"I don't think this book gets as much recognition as it deserves! I loved it â€” it's a beautiful book set in Guernsey in 1946, told completely in letters and telegrams the characters send to each other. The Channel Islands were the only part of the the British Isles that were occupied by Germans, and being so seemingly insignificant the British government didn't spend much on protecting them. This book shows the aftermath of living with 'the enemy' for nearly the whole war. Often the characters recall what it was like in 1940-45, painting a gruesome and harsh picture. A character arrives at Guernsey, having suffered most of the war in the largest all-women's concentration camp, Ravensbruck. 

It's surprisingly comforting as it portrays the terrors of war and the grim reality of life during the occupation; it is also a pure romance between a writer from London and a pig farmer from Guernsey and a romance of books. It is a story of chosen family. It's wish fulfillment for me, so reading it feels like going home. It also contains a lot of tongue-in-cheek humour guaranteed to make you laugh aloud. And a very unique six year old, orphan of a bold, brave English mother and a kind Nazi. Happy ending. In my opinion, it ended too soon! 

I would recommend it to anyone who's interested in WWII, books, romance and family. 

Anyone else read this and liked it? I'd love to talk to someone about it; I don't know anyone who's read it."
