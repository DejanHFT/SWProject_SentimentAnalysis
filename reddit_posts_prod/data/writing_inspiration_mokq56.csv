Plot writing. Inspiration or perspiration?,Brettelectric,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/mokq56/plot_writing_inspiration_or_perspiration/,34,31," 

I'm at the very beginning stages of my fantasy novel - mostly world building, character creation, and jotting down 'cool ideas' for what I want to happen in the story, or 'cool scenes' that I would like to write. I've got a few sections of a plot in note form, but I'm well short of a full plot.

So I was wondering how you folks write or sketch out a plot outline? Do you just wait until the ideas come to you, and then jot them down? Is it pure inspiration?

Or do you sit down for an extended period of time, and 'force' out a plot. Maybe you brainstorm a whole bunch of possible plot features or something, and pick out the best ones?

I'm interested to know what method works for you! Thanks!"
