Has anyone read Harry Potter as an adult for the first time and recommends it?,harry_powell,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/do5jqy/has_anyone_read_harry_potter_as_an_adult_for_the/,2643,10184,"Even thought I’m exactly the age in where Harry Potter peaked, I never read the books. Not because I wasn’t a reader, but precisely because of that. I remember being kinda mad at everyone adult telling me “oh, you read all the time? You must have devoured the HP books like my son did”. HP was so ubiquitous that a contrarian spirit grew in me. Also, I was at that age in where I was feeling proud of reading “mature” books and reading stuff for children (even though that’s what I was) felt beneath me.

So, the whole phenomenon passed me by. Never saw the movies either. Now in my early 30s I feel like I’ve missed out on a big cultural touchstone. 

Would it make any sense to go back and pick up the books from the start? Do they hold up as an adult?

I’m kinda in the mood for a big fantasy saga to read this winter."
