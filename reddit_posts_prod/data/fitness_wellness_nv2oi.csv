Eating Well in the Office,Timid_Atheist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/nv2oi/eating_well_in_the_office/,57,11,"For those of us chained to an office desk for 8+ hours a day, I think eating well can be a challenge. It seems that a daily trip to vending machine or corner coffee shop is a big social event for most, and even when one declines those invites, it's rather hard to resist the ""Do you want some?"" when the food (read: junk food) comes back. 

Mix that with the general boredom of staring at a computer screen all day, and eating well and within your daily caloric limits can be a tough struggle. 

So, what are your little tricks and healthy treats that help keep you on track and avoid the office snack attacks?
