My Husband doesn't know how to be emotionally supportive even when provided examples. 32m 32f,Throwawayx1005,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6qigza/my_husband_doesnt_know_how_to_be_emotionally/,33,18,"So as the title States my husband does not know how to provide emotional support ever and often times when I try to provide examples of what I would like to hear that would provide me with comfort and support left feeling validated and heard it usually turns into an argument and he gets extremely defensive and we end up talking about how his needs are never met. 

A little bit of our history is we've been together for almost 5 years we have a 3 year old son and he works for the military and I Have a successful job working from home. 



We have gone to couples counseling because it's obvious we have to separate communication Styles and love languages and it pretty much got us nowhere because we always end up back in a negative cycle when it comes to my trying to be heard. He always tells me he's trying but I don't see it because I don't feel it. He also says I am impossible to please and I truly feel like I have put so much effort and sacrificed so much and it's obvious because this past year I have pushed through on my own and he still doesn't seem to resonate with how I'm always coming last especially due to his career. It hurts me deeply. It's just not easy for him to make sure I feel loved it's always a battle and I'm not even sure I'm in love anymore because I'm just so tired of feeling hurt I'm tired of feeling steamrolled I'm tired of always getting into an argument when I try to matter. 



My husband's been away for the past year so I've been left home to be responsible for are toddler he's not in daycare and also working from home and maintaining the property and we have to pet and are also now selling because we've been posted so I have a lot on my shoulders and some days are way easier than others but I do suffer from anxiety which has really come to a head within the past 3 weeks and I ended up in the hospital at the doctor's office and put on a anti-anxiety medication and was told to completely relax but obviously due to our situation and circumstances that's clearly going to be limited.
I just feel like even though he's been away for a year I thought he would have showered me with extream affection to compensate for the distance and everyday I send him a hundred pictures of his son I send him at least 10 videos a day to make sure that he gets to watch him grow and experience life. I tried setting up a surprise birthday party for him when he was away I surprised him with Christmas I just keep pushing myself to show him how much he matters and I'm getting nothing in return but arguments :(.



My spouse indicates all the time that he cares about my feelings and he wants me to be stress-free but everytime I try to vent or have my needs Matt it always turns into an argument and I don't understand why it's so hard for him to just offer me support even when I'm providing him examples of what I would rather hear we still always end up arguing and then not talking for a few days and nothing gets resolved which is extremely frustrating because of the distance between us and my not having any type of Freedom or validation has really started making me resent him and considering just leaving the relationship completely. 


When I sit back and think about all of our arguments one thing that sticks out to me is how everytime I tell him I don't like the way he's phrasinging his words it always resorts to him being so defensive that leads to anger that leads to him saying really hurtful things to which later he is apologizing for it and blaming anger and that's usually his excuse but you know it started to stick with me. I just can't rely on him for support or to even have a conversation to find resolved and peace because of how defensive and angry he constantly gets. I've also resorted as of recently to the same tactics and called him a loser last night because he just doesn't get it and it blows me away that he doesn't want to put the effort in to change that I'm so frustrated that I'm acting the exact same way and it's just toxic.


Part of me wants to believe that the distance between us was just too much and I'm trying to understand that he's on one of the hardest courses that the military offers and you know I understand being away from his son is probably really hard for him and he probably doesn't want to hear about him not meeting my needs when he's probably not meeting any of his either and I think we just are at a point where we don't know what to do so we just continue to argue about not having our needs met which confuses me because I'm always willing to work on things and talk about things and he agrees with me all the time that we could be better but every time the topic comes up it always turns into a negative Circle of no resolve. 
To me it's just so easy to incorporate caring about how the person feels and responding accordingly why wouldn't he wants to make me feel good I don't know why it's so hard for him to get out of the negative cycle and it just confuses the hell out of me. 

Tldr: my spouse and I do not know how to communicate I often blame the military for turning him into a robot. Idk what to do because he's definitely not meeting my needs emotionally even with examples.
