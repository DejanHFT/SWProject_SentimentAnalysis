"How much ""chance"" is a factor in businesses, entrepreneurship, startups? How can I know?",MrBugabooX,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/lkl31l/how_much_chance_is_a_factor_in_businesses/,2,1,"Hello.

I am sorry if this is a common question which is asked here, however my question will be a little bit different.

I have heard things like 9 out of 10 startups fail, survivorship bias etc. so how much does luck plays a role in business success? Alternative answers like ""It is mostly luck, however the success is about playing the probability game again and again until return of investments came."" are also welcome.

What my main question is: I am undecided between ""Luck plays an important role."" and ""It is mostly skill."" How can I know, which one of these are correct? How can I be sure, without starting a couple of businesses and trying? (which is a terrible way to run an experiment -only 1 subject-) How can I understand it is X and not Y?

Thank you."
