Is there such a thing as uplifting or at least not-bad-feeling drone metal?,gregaro,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/12kx55n/is_there_such_a_thing_as_uplifting_or_at_least/,7,1,"I find myself in a tricky spot with drone metal at the moment because on the one hand I love a lot of things about it, but on the other hand it all seems to have an emotional tone of dread and doom which, you know, I'm sure is not an issue for a lot of people who are into metal but for me personally I have to be sort of careful about how much of that sort of thing I ingest... but like I said I love a lot about drone metal, I love the deep/rich/interesting textures and how utterly massive and epic it all sounds. So my question is, is there anything out there in this vein that isn't emotionally/spiritually so pitch black? Maybe even something that feels kinda uplifting/happy/positive/triumphant in some way? But at the very least just something that doesn't sound like death?"
