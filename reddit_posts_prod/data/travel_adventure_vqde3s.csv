Thailand Adventure Travel suggestions,rasdhir,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/vqde3s/thailand_adventure_travel_suggestions/,12,3,"Hi there! Heading to Thailand from July 5th to August 2nd.

Itinerary so far is follows:
- July 5-13 - At Tiger Muay Thai in Phuket
- July 13-17 - Koh Phangan for Full Moon Party 

Looking for help beyond that. Also would love suggestions while in Phuket.

My style of travel is:

- Love adventures (I.e. physical activity [hikes, water sports, etc.], unique activity [ping pong show, Sak Yant tattoo], spirituality [meditation or yoga camp, etc.], other?)

- Hate sightseeing (unless part of a good hike or very very good reason) 

- Neutral on beaches, partying and food. Cool if I get it, fine if I skip for a good adventure."
