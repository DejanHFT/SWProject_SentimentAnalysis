So what motivates you to keep on?,aLusaLu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/uiskx/so_what_motivates_you_to_keep_on/,52,3,"I used to work out a lot and looked after the things i was eating.

But now adays i just let go and don't have the motivation to go on or even start doing something.
Maybe i am too lazy, but i can't get any ideas up.

What keeps you going on, is there something that you would say, ""this is why i want to improve""?


EDIT: Thank you all for sharing your personal motivation, it will sure be helpful for me to start again.
I will keep you up to date in this subreddit, how my training will start affecting me... again :-)"
