TBH The CGI Rachel from Blade Runner 2049 is still the best de-aging in cinema,SitriHyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/14vumw6/tbh_the_cgi_rachel_from_blade_runner_2049_is/,162,487,"Maybe I am biased because I love both Blade Runner movies, but in my opinion the scene with Rachel in Blade Runner 2049 (A movie with almost 6 years) is better than all other de-aging I saw in movies. Even better, the scenes that the VFX team recreated from the original movie are  virtually indistinguishable from the original source."
