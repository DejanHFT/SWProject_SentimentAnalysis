Did Sub Urban steal the melody for Cradles from Flobots?,ICanEditPostTitles,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/19dnq8r/did_sub_urban_steal_the_melody_for_cradles_from/,0,0,"Sub Urban - Cradles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBtk5FUeJbk

How close does a song have to be before it's stolen?

This feels close, but slightly different to the Ed Sheeran/Sami Chokri case. In that case, it was only a small part of Ed's song. Sub Urban has pretty much based the entire song on the same note progression."
