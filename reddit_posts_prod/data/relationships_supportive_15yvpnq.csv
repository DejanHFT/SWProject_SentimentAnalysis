How do I support my boyfriend?,DumbHoeBtch,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15yvpnq/how_do_i_support_my_boyfriend/,2,2,"I'm (M18) in a new relationship with a man (M18) who loves me and that I love so much, he's treating me properly and everything but lately he's been shutting me out and I'm struggling to support him properly.  We're in a long distance relationship and he's being having a absolute terrible month, I'm not going to say what's being going on because that's not my thing to say but it's just being awful.  I don't know how I can fully support him if I don't know what's wrong.  I've being very patient with him and still continue to be but its so hard to see him like this and I really don't know what to do.  It's destroying my heart seeing him all upset and overwhelmed.  I've got no one to turn too since my friends abandoned me.  I told my friend last night and he straight up blocked me.  I feel like a terrible boyfriend and feel utterly useless.

TLDR; my boyfriend is stressed out and I don't know how to help him properly."
