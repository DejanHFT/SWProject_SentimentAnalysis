"My (20M) girlfriend (19F) is very supportive, loving, and honestly is wonderful. But she is an avid conspiracy theorist.",rgb1997,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8gc04p/my_20m_girlfriend_19f_is_very_supportive_loving/,56,39,"First, a little bit of background: I am a 20-year old college student in the US. My girlfriend is 19, not in college right now, and she lives a few hours from me. 


My girlfriend is great. We’ve been together for 9 months, and despite the distance, we call each other every day. We are really committed to each other and I love being with her, I care about her, and we honestly make each other really happy. She fits all the criteria you could have for a good long-term partner…


Except for this one thing.


Some of her worldviews about the government and society are completely ridiculous. Most of her views center around the idea that the US government is against the best interest of the people, and that government wants to profit from the people as much as possible, even at the expense of the people’s well-being.

I’ll give some examples.


* She avoids drinking tap water from the faucet because she thinks the trace levels of fluoride in drinking water, which are added to it intentionally, are not for bacteria and dental health, but because fluoride is a toxin the government places it there to poison the people. 


* She avoids eating traditional table salt. As most people know, salt causes an increase in blood pressure and can contribute to heart disease when over consumed. She believes this is because the salt you buy in the grocery store (think Morton iodized salt) contains substantial amounts of glass shards and sand. She believes these particles enter your blood stream and “scrape the walls of your arteries” and cause plaque build-up. That’s her explanation for why heart disease is linked to heavy salt consumption. So, she eats Himalayan pink salt.


* She believes 9/11 was set up by the government. she showed me a documentary entitled “zeitgeist,” a 3 part documentary of incredibly controversial falsehoods. Part 2 was about 9/11 government conspiracies.


* She also has suffered from depression and anxiety (nothing wrong with that obviously) but she avoids taking medications for these because she thinks they’re ineffective and that they are the government trying to poison or control people.


* She thinks that scientists have found the cure for cancer. She believes there several successful cancer treatments that exist, but the government hides them and ceases data from scientists who discover them because the government wants to profit from cancer patients through expensive, not-as-effective treatments like chemotherapy. Some of these “cancer cures” are vitamin b17 (look it up) and marijuana. She also says “oxygenating blood” and “raising blood pH” can prevent and cure cancer. All forms of cancer, overall.


* She believes that crystals, such as quartz and amethyst, have healing properties. She carries crystals around with her all the time, and sleeps with them, because they “cleanse her aura” and “boost her mood and well-being” because of the “vibrations” they give off. 


* I think she also believes that vaccines are the government trying to control and probably poison people. She may be an antivaxxer.


These are just some examples. I’ve tried challenging these beliefs directly, and she holds to them like religious faith. She is convinced that any OBVIOUS evidence against these beliefs (evidence you could find in a google search) are simply people submitting to what the government/society expects you to believe. She thinks she knows the “reality” and “truth” behind everything. To be honest, these beliefs do not affect our relationship that much. Day to day, She just shares memes and Instagram posts about these topics, I ignore them, and I just eat the Himalayan pink salt and go with the flow because that’s the kind of person I am. I don’t feel like having passioned arguments about these topics, I’d rather just have a good time with her. However, I have a background in science (I study neuroscience.) I’ve taken classes in biology. I have… common sense. These beliefs are horse shit to me.  


If a girl is mostly perfect for you, and you’d love to commit to something long term, how do you deal with this? I can’t just say “you are drowning in cognitive biases and all your beliefs are laughably stupid” because she’d get defensive, think I’m being closed minded to the “reality” she sees, and she’d take it as a personal attack. I am such an evidence based, science-driven person, and I don’t know how I could be with someone who believes this stuff. But here I am, 9 months into a relationship with a girl who otherwise is really great. Is it shallow to question your entire relationship for something like this? 

TL;DR: My girlfriend is really great for me, she's loving and awesome. But she believes in various ludicrous conspiracy theories and I think they're laughably stupid."
