Strategy games where you really have to use strategy and adapt to the situation,Sebzerrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/16320mc/strategy_games_where_you_really_have_to_use/,61,1,"ALL TEXT: 

Im enough of how many strategy games don't really require thinking because all you have to do is have more troops/better quality troops to conquer the neighboring country and then thanks to the snowball effect conquer everyone else around you faster and easier.

I have played many strategy games but none met my needs. It's not that I'm complaining about the lack of a perfect game, I mean that none of these games even come close.

Every time I play a new and more and more complicated strategy, sooner or later I discover the only optimal way to act, some OP tactic and I blow everything. I miss a key element in strategy games: adapting the AI to the situation.

Here, in a nutshell, I will tell you about my experiences in the strategy games currently recognized by fans of strategies as the best ones of this type:

Eu4: 

This game is a pure example of the snowball effect: all the strength and capabilities of your country depend on the amount of development, each province has a certain amount of dev. The more provinces you conquer, the more dev you have and the more you can conquer. There are a lot of diplomatic options, but if you play this game for a long time, you know how to use them, then you see instead of 50 buttons only these: declare war, make an alliance, spy, create claims, and 45 options to improve diplomatic relations...

It's better here because you can create your own country builds and test them, but after you check them, it turns out that there are only 1-3 builds so strong that it doesn't make sense to use others. It's better because the number of provinces is not so important, the number of planets (which can be built in a certain build) is more important, but the most important is the amount of population, so you can theoretically be the most powerful with only one planet.
It's fun to play tall but only once because again too strong is just playing optimally, i.e. conquering everything.
You know whether you will win the battle before it starts because the fleets have numbers representing the strength of the fleet - there is no strategy here. This is the reason i would put stellaris as the worst strategy but good role play sim country for newbies to strategies. You can do nothing interesting in diplomacy options. Just the basics for this kind kf game.

we are not talking about hoi.

crusader kings:
It's more of a king role play than a strategy game.

Total War:
In the early stages of the game, the battles are fantastic real strategy, you can defeat a stronger army with a weaker one thanks to the right tactics. The game is destroyed by the snowball effect already in midgame, there is no point in fighting battles manually, you start automatic battles because you know in advance that you will win with a stronger and larger army. Diplomacy in these games is a joke you might as well remove everything and just leave the button to declare war.

Any multiplayer rts:
I hate this kind of games, we are talking about player vs ai strategies not rts.

AOE (vs ai)
There is one ""right"" strategy for each country you do that everytime and you win unless you are noob.
There is literally no diplomacy.

TLTR:

That being said im asking you for advice. What strategy game should i try? Maybe there is something less popular that is actually better.

Summary of what I'm looking for in a strategy game:

-Ai that adapts to the situation, e.g. if I spam one type of unit, they build counter units.
- Diplomacy that matters. Possibilities of intrigue and schemes. Doing things not related to wars.
- Battles that can be won with tactics instead of just bigger numbers
- Something that reduces the snowball effect
- Something where there is no single optimal strategy because ai will adapt to repeated action
- Fictional world/map is an asset. It doesn't have to be a historical game (most strategy games try to be historical for some reason)"
