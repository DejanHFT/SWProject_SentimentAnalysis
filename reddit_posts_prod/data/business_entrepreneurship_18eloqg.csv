We've explored e-commerce, marketing, YouTube, and various other options. We are 100% sure that we don't want to be part of the matrix and aim to escape the 9-5 life one day. We have big dreams of becoming entrepreneurs and managing our own businesses. In the past, we have done small projects, earned a bit here and there, getting a taste of entrepreneurship, but we've never committed to anything.

All three of us are 22 years old, we exercise, run every morning, and pursue our respective studies. Mentioning this to highlight our discipline.

The question is, what do you recommend we do? Where should we start? Which INDUSTRY do you recommend? We're open to anything; we just want to find an industry to become professionals in. We're willing to spend hours learning something new.

Hope you understand us. We're very motivated."
