There would be nothing to be ""contemplative"" about. You're just a fucking product of all these other people you hate, all you'd be contemplating about is them and what information they've put in your brain throughout your life - even if you think there is somehow this special ""you."" Misanthropes are among some of the most illogical individuals. That's it, I'm officially a goddamn mis-misanthrope.""

So why this has anything to do with philosophy is simply (and long-windedly) this:

atheist_creationist argues that misanthropy is undesirable because it ignores the fundamental connectivity of society and the great debt we owe our fellow person. Why dislike those that have given you so much, especially those that have done nothing to you? This is absolutely supported by Sociological and Psychological findings. We are completely indebted to those around and those that came before us. History, Cultural Studies, etc all seem to bear this out as well. 

I don't think Philosophy bears this out as a whole. I think Philosophy started out self-indulgent in that the main theme of much of ancient greek thought was based on how one achieves the ""good"" for one's self (all societal good stems from personal good in virtually every ancient greek philosophical system). Plato is the obvious example, but all the pre-socrates were similar in this way, and the Stoics as well. Philosophy after Descartes has very much been about the self, and not about the other. From metaphysical doubt, to Nihilism, Existentialism, etc. You have some rogue political philosophy that touches on society, Hegel, Mill, Locke, Hobbes, etc. Most of their systems however start at the personal level and work their way out. Natural rights or the state of nature, being examples. When you get to the more modern times, you have Positivists whose materialism and reductionism (I think) is very isolating and perhaps does away with everything including the self. You have subsequent post-modernism and the more recent trends in continental philosophy which are phenomenological in nature and therefore based with the self. Some cultural studies and cultural criticism leave the self, but is always from the point of view of the self. 

What I am getting at here, in the most general possible sense, is that philosophy is, and has been mainly concerned with, a very self-centered view of existence. Don't beat me over the head if you find counter-examples, Spinoza or perhaps Nietzsche spend time talking about things other than themselves. So this isn't a universal truth, its just a general trend. Now this conclusion I am stretching for is probably due to the nature of our existence. Yet, as I've previously mention, Sociology, Psychology, etc., all hold that we are extremely reliant on others and the context in which we find ourselves in. 

Would you agree that Philosophy is, by nature, about the self as a general trend? How would you reconcile that with what the social sciences tell us? 

***BONUS #1:***

Most of the people who have directly and indirectly done things for you are dead, your past relatives, past builders of society, past scientists, past innovators. The causal chain is long. Problematically, most of the people around you have done nothing for you and could potentially harm you. Only your parents and some of your relatives, some acquaintances of theirs, had done anything directly for you when you were born. People you meet from then on may help you directly, but only if you offer them something whether it be love, money, or simple interaction. The network of current people is tiny compared to the network of past people. I don't think people really think about this, but it seems to be an added layer of isolation and quark of actually existing in the now. Is it ironic that most of the people who've helped you are dead, and most of the people who either won't help you or will harm you are alive and around you at this very moment? 

***BONUS #2:***

So, assuming the general trend of philosophy is the self, what if it weren't? What would it be like if people hadn't spent so much time philosophizing about themselves, and philosophized about others? How would such a philosophy arise? What would it entail?
