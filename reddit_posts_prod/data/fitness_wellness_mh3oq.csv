Opinions of Paleo/Neanderthal diet?,mycullyfrog,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/mh3oq/opinions_of_paleoneanderthal_diet/,44,6,"My wife works for a pharmacy/wellness clinic. One of her co-workers mentioned that she was on the Neanderthal diet and had lost 10 lbs. When she asked about it at the wellness clinic, the worker gave her a book called ""The Paleo Diet"" by Loren Cordain. As is the way with diet books, it seems a little gimmicky, and when we asked about it at the doctor's office, the doctor called it the hunter/gatherer diet and said she is a former vegetarian on a modified version of it. We are interested in trying it, but are wary of yet another fad. So, what does r/Fitness think? Anybody heard anything or had any experience with it? "
