Does artificial intelligence already exist? And couldn't the internet be described as a Synthetic Intelligence?,Servicemaster,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/rik6e/does_artificial_intelligence_already_exist_and/,4,1,"I ask this because if we assume that 'real' intelligence is just our own, then what are computers alone? It seems it's only fabricated by us and works within only the confines of a machine and nothing organic. Unless electricity is organic?

And so, isn't AI just a pipe dream? Can't we already look to every human hooked up online and collaborating as a sort of Super-Intelligence? And wouldn't the purpose of this be to create more connections to people and machine? What's the forecast for this?

I see the future as more of a fusing of man and machine and not separate, and it looks to me as if it has already happened.

Ultimately I ask: What are we doing as a society to facilitate the combination of all intelligence?"
