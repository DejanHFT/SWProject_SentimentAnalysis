Worst cinema experiences?,MNightsLegendOfAaung,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/b4usvk/worst_cinema_experiences/,370,134,"So I saw Us yesterday and the screen was packed. Prior to this I had waited in line for about 20 minutes just to get some snacks and got to my seat just in time for the movie to start so I wasn't in the best mood. Throughout (and I mean ALL throughout) there was this couple sitting next to me who were whispering and laughing at parts that were supposed to be tense and pointing and making ""oh fuck!"" ""oh god!"" ""no way!"" type remarks. It distracted me so much from the movie (which I really loved) that there were parts where we get a bit of exposition to understand what's happening that I couldn't hear what characters were saying.
I don't go to the cinema much but when I do I get excited for it. So to have people in the theatre with me who don't give a damn about other people and who are clearly just there to kill a few hours and have a laugh as if they're the only ones there is super annoying and ruins what could otherwise have been a great experience.

This may have been one of my worst cinema viewings, though I know it's certainly not as bad as it can get. What are your worst movie-going experiences in terms of the audience around you?"
