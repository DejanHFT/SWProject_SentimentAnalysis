Interests: historical places, trying local food, easy hikes, meeting locals/new people, don’t want to hit too many museums but interested in WWII. Prefer hidden gems over flashy touristy stuff. 

Light travelers and flexible with moving around at a fast pace but want to absorb as much as we can in each area with some downtime if possible. Normally, we try to skip the capital busy cities when we travel in Asia, but in Europe we are really not sure if that’s an option?"
