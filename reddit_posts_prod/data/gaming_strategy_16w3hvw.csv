Realistic and not too complex strategy games,kautschukmaaan,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/16w3hvw/realistic_and_not_too_complex_strategy_games/,18,6,"I’m looking for some new strategy games to play. I’m playing mainly on macOS and ps5. 

In the past o really liked games like stronghold crusader and Rome total war. Although I want to play a realistic strategy game without real time battles like you have in the total war games."
