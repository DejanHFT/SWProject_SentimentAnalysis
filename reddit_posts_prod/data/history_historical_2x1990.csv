Historical Events Not Yet Adapted For Film,COL2015,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2x1990/historical_events_not_yet_adapted_for_film/,296,135,"I'm looking for interesting and/or significant historical events and/or people that haven't yet been adapted for the big screen.  If there's a specific book about the event or person, I'd love to hear about that too.

Something along the lines of IMITATION GAME or MONUMENTS MEN.

Who has Hollywood left behind thus far?  Who has such an incredible story that it has to be told?

Any suggestions are appreciated!

EDIT: These are great suggestions, thanks everyone for chiming in!  Always open to more if you're a little late to the party.
