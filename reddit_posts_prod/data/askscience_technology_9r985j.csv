I am [J.R. Skok](https://www.jrskok.com/). I am a planetary scientist with the SETI Institute and a Space entrepreneur. I am working with SETI and NASA to develop future missions to [search for life on Mars](https://www.madeofmars.com/), map out the minerals and geologic history of that planet while leading expeditions to Mars analogs around the world, including Antarctica, Iceland, Hawaii and more. As a Space Entrepreneur, I founded the company, Made of Mars, to develop the technology and economics needed to build things from the materials we can find on Mars, the Moon and asteroids throughout the solar system and share that journey with you!
