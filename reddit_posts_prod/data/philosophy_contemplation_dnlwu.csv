r/philosophy! I'm looking for some insight and research help!,xployt,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/dnlwu/rphilosophy_im_looking_for_some_insight_and/,17,5,"Before we get going, yes, I have Googled my topic of choice, so we'll just skip that part if anyone chooses to respond to this.  
On to the fun bits...  
I am in the contemplation stages of an argumentative essay regarding Sartre and his position on depression. As we likely already know, according to Sartre, the world is of our on manifestation (drastic simplification, I know). We are radically free and thus, a mental condition such as depression is our own fault. That is, it is our fault if we choose to suffer by it. I have not locked down a solid opinion for my argument yet, however I stand somewhere in between being at the mercy of the illness and being in total control of it. I believe it is within our power to *do* something about it, however we may not always be in the state of mind to be able to take action. That is, paralyzing depression exists and is not within our power to overcome at any time.    
Disregarding our dissenting opinions of depression as a condition itself: Does anyone have anything they feel particularly relevant to this discussion? Additionally, does anyone have a favourite resource (online or otherwise) that they would like to share in assisting in my research.  
I thank you all in advance, I hope someone takes an interest!"
