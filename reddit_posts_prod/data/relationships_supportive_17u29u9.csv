How to support my friend through her breakup,grroovvee,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17u29u9/how_to_support_my_friend_through_her_breakup/,3,1,"My friend just broke up with her fiancé of 4 years. From the outside looking in they had a fantastic relationship but in reality he was cheating on her with hookers and lying about it. 

She is understandably gutted. He has moved out and now she is in their huge house by herself. She is not sure if she should sell the house, get a roommate, or live in the home alone. 

Right now she is just devastated and does not want to be alone. Our friends are doing what we can to support her but I am wondering if there is anything else that I should be thinking about that could help her heal.

She is 47 he is 45. 

Tl;dr: my friends fiancé cheated and she’s devastated. How can I support her?"
