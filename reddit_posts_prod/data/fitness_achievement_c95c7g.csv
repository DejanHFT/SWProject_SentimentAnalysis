"Too many goals, how to mix training to achieve them?",ArchfiendJ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/c95c7g/too_many_goals_how_to_mix_training_to_achieve_them/,3,0,"Hello.
I've too many goals and not enough time for each of them. I'd like to know what sort of training I could do to achieve them.

My goals are in order

* Health: I need to improve my cardio.
* Health: I also need to improve my back and shoulder strength and flexibility. Also leg flexibility.
* Conditioning : I need more core strength and be able to last a 1h/1h30 Taekwondo session and belt exams. 
* Flexibility: I need more leg flexibility for Taekwondo.
* Volume: I'm a bit light (70kg for 182cm) so I'd like to put on some weight.

Since it's summer there is no taek courses so I'm doing :

* 1h stationary bike, 2 times per week.
* 2 strength/flexibility session with: face pulls, shrugs, pull up, pull down and lately bench press. After that I do a bit of plank and ab wheel and then some stretch (mainly leg) 

September I'll do 2 teak courses per week (maybe 3) and will have 2 to 3 fitness session left per week.

I'm really open to advices, thank you."
