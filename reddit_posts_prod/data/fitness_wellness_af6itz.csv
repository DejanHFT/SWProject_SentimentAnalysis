Started training at a fairly well known powerlifting and bodybuilding gym in my country. I have a few questions about the routine they gave me.,ss3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/af6itz/started_training_at_a_fairly_well_known/,272,2014,"As of 2019 my company is subsidizing 1200 â‚¬ (around 1400 $) for us to get gym memberships and spend on other health/lifestyle related stuff so one of the guys on my team and I joined a local gym in my city that is fairly well known in my country for producing some local talent in powerlifting and bodybuilding that compete on both the local and international scenes. However we are mostly just in it to get to be healthy and strong for longevity purposes.

The trainer at the gym set us up with the gym's beginner routine which is the following:

**Workout 1**:

* Squat 3x5
* Bench Press 3x5
* Seated Cable Row 3x5
* Weighted Pull-up 3x5
* Barbell Glute Bridge 3x5
* Romainian Deadlift 3x10
* Accessories: Face Pulls 4x15, Leg Curl 4x15

**Workout 2**:

* Deadlift 3x5
* Overhead Press 3x5
* Weighted Chin-up 3x5
* Barbell Row 3x5
* Incline Press with Dumbbells 3x5
* Barbell Lunge 3x10
* Accessories: Rear Delt Fly 4x15, Glute Ham Raise 4x10

We are supposed to workout 2-3 days per week switching off each time between workout 1 and 2. The rest period is supposed to be 2 minutes for the first two exercises on each list, 90 seconds for the others. We increase the weight by one unit (for machines) or 2.5kg total (for barbells) the next session if we complete the lift with the given weight. The accessories they gave us are personal to us, since we are both software engineers. We were told to make sure not to neglect our back, rear shoulders, and hamstrings since we spend a lot of time sitting.

When we aren't in the gym there is a plan for the cardio portion of the workout (which is optional but we are doing it) where we start off running 5km 2x per week, and over 3 months it ends up going up to 10km. It's extremely cold and snowy here so they gave us some running ice spikes to attach to our shoes so we don't slip on the ice.

We were also told to eat at least our bodyweight in protein (in grams). For example I weigh 85kg so I was told to eat at least 85g protein per day.

I have a few questions:

1. The workout routine they gave me is a lot different than the ones I see in the FAQ. Is this a problem? I mean there is no arms workouts or calves workouts at all, but from what I noticed the guys who had been doing the workout for a while actually had quite proportional arms/calves to their bodies and they looked pretty nice.

2. Is the amount of protein enough? Again, it is less than what I have seen posted here but I asked a few guys and the trainer and they said the high protein amounts in fitness magazines and blogs were all complete BS and to just eat a well balanced diet with the amount of protein listed and I should be good.

3. There is no ab workout in the routine but the dudes I see doing this exact routine (although for over a year) actually have visible abs. How is this possible? To be honest I haven't asked anyone about it yet but I was thinking of asking later today when I go to the gym. Maybe they do abs at home, I have no idea.

Edit:

Forgot to mention my statistics, if that helps for any of the questions:

* Sex/Gender: Male
* Age: 25
* Height: 198cm (6 ft 6 in)
* Weight 85kg (187 lbs)
