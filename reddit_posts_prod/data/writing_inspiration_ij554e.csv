What is a constant source of inspiration for you?,JadedRavenclaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/ij554e/what_is_a_constant_source_of_inspiration_for_you/,118,130,"What’s something you can always go back to, to get ideas? Is there a book, a movie, a game etc? For me it’s Alice in Wonderland. For me it’s a story filled with so many oddities that it could take multiple routes. You could take it as a children’s book, or make it a horror, or a psychological thriller about a girl who doesn’t know what’s real and what isn’t, an action, a fantasy, and other things. I have gotten so many ideas from AIW. I was wondering if anyone else has something they always go back to for inspiration.

Edit - thanks for everyone who shared! It was so nice to read and inspiring as well. Happy writing!"
