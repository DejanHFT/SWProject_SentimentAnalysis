Need cover suggestions for these 🫣,wanderlost25,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/194fpyj,5,2,"My husband hung our mantle while I was out of town. We ageeed on a floating mantle, but I guess his ears weren’t turned on for that conversation. Anyways, here’s what he actually did….ugh & sigh. 

I had the heavy, harsh and industrial black brackets, SO MUCH!!!! They’re in there for good now. So how to hide their hideous? 

Would some sort of Venetian cover work? Is that even something that could be achieved? 

I’m not the most knowledgeable on materials but I just feel there MUST be a way to hide these chunky ugly foes of mine. 

If you have any ideas or suggestions, please send them my way it would be much appreciated. 🙏🏼"
