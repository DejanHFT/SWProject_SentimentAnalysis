"Remember Yaad's Awesome Handstand Push Up Video Tutorial? Well, I created a detailed outline of it, complete with weekly schedules for every stage so you know EXACTLY what you need to do each day!",Antranik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3ulh9f/remember_yaads_awesome_handstand_push_up_video/,74,1598,"A couple months ago, /u/Yaad_Mohammad came out with a HSPU video tutorial. You should [watch it now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQhrk6WMcKw) if you haven't. It's long but educational and highly entertaining.

Since the video was entrenched with SO much info, I made a blog post that outlined some of it so that we could all make better sense of it and actually DO IT.

Then, even after typing out the programming for the stages, I was still overwhelmed by the program, so I created a Weekly Schedule for all the stages. This made it extremely CLEAR what I need to do everyday.

Hope that helps!"
