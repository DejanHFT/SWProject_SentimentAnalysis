How big a role does a film's genre play in how it's critiqued?,Lew_AIcindor,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4bd2ed/how_big_a_role_does_a_films_genre_play_in_how_its/,4,0,"I'm not a big film guy, but this is something I've always wondered about. You can extend it further and say how much context should be applied in general.

One example I guess is some people complain about the lack of characterization in Inception besides Cobb. Which I don't disagree with. But, it's essentially a heist film. At least of the heist films I've seen, few characters are actually characterized due to the ensemble nature of the cast. Usually you have the lead and maybe one or two other characters that are. But it seems like that's not really factored in when people talk about in, it was reviewed more generally.

As opposed to, let's say Mad Max: Fury Road. Which I didn't think  offered much in way of characterization either other than Nux and maybe Furiosa - which doesn't mean the performances or the characters were bad obviously. But I don't think it bothered people as much as the lack of characterization in Inception. I would say Mad Max was critiqued in some ways, more in relation to other action films. 

If my examples are incorrect, then, uh, ignore them. Just curious about opinions."
