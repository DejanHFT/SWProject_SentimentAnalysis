"What are the places you have ""thoroughly"" / fully explored? Is your own hometown one of those places? Do you have a wish-list of places to explore in depth?",SlowAndSteady101,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15zp22z/what_are_the_places_you_have_thoroughly_fully/,5,1,"Even though there are places I want to explore more in depth I personally feel like it's too difficult to truly explore any one place (including cities I've lived in for years at at a  time). Especially mega cities.  But at the same time there is probably a threshold most people set for themselves for checking off the ""top"" well known attractions for places they visit.  Perhaps, when you are visiting and don't expect to stay for long you might make a bigger effort to see the top attractions  & biggest things that place has to offer. Also, you might not be as motivated in your own home or want to save resources (time, money, energy) for more ""exotic"" locations.

I imagine it's mostly a ""feeling"" and no real ""hard"" definition.

What is your definition of fully exploring a location/city?  Visiting all the museums (or maybe just the top x)?  Does it include eating both at the highest end place(s) and at the lowest end / street food?  Shopping at the local supermarkets? Having the local desserts, beers, etc? Visiting all the  UNESCO sites in that city?   Walking around all the main ""sub-neighborhoods""? Driving around?  Taking public transport? Drinking at a local pub/bar? Going to the main nightclubs? Taking a class?  Volunteering? Working in that city? Other things most people might not think of right away?

Or do you mainly go for what ""defines"" that city at a glance (what most people would know that city for)?

In the same vein, do you feel like you have fully explored your own hometown (or current residence, if you've lived there for years)?

&#x200B;

Do you have a list of cities you want to more ""fully"" explore and do a very deep dive?
