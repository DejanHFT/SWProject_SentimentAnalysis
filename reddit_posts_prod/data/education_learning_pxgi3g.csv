Unstructured vs. structured learning?,navywalrus96,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/pxgi3g/unstructured_vs_structured_learning/,3,1,"I'm new to this sub, and for my first post I'd love to see what everyone thinks about structured learning versus unstructured learning. As I understand it, structured learning proceeds according to a set of objectives/goals, while unstructured learning simply does not have such formal structures. Articles such as [this one](https://wabisabilearning.com/blogs/literacy-numeracy/future-education-unstructured-learning) claim that unstructured learning is the ""future,"" but is that convincing? I'd love to hear your thoughts."
