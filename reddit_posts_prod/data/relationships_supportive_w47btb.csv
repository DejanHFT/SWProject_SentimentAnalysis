Boyfriend (25M) is unhappy with his life and I (24F) am having a hard time being as supportive as I need to be after so many months,Alternative_Jury_460,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/w47btb/boyfriend_25m_is_unhappy_with_his_life_and_i_24f/,7,3,"My boyfriend has been unhappy for some time and I am reaching my wits end of being a supportive girlfriend

My boyfriend and I have been together for 4.5 years. We met when we were in college and have been best friends and teammates ever since. I have seen a lot of relationships in my life and I would say mine is incredibly healthy and just wonderful. We are complete equals, have the same interests and goals in life and I am allowed to be the very strong independent woman that I am. However, starting to date when your 20 definitely has its ups and downs. We have gone through so many major life events together and come out of each one stronger and better. Except for right now. 

My boyfriend works a very demanding job in accounting with very long hours and he is incredibly unhappy. This unhappiness with his work was something we really easily dealt with until recently. Recently, his job has given him crippling anxiety and made him not himself. He yells at the computer and it feels like all he can talk about is how unhappy he is. This has been months of us having long discussions at night and me being so supportive and giving him all the advice I can. Side note, I graduated before him and worked basically the same job for 2 years. I encountered the same situations and so I have (what I believe) to be very relevant advice. I spend hours and what feels like any time we have together discussing his work situation and trying to help him. 

It has reached a point where I will find him crying and I am just unsure of how to help at this point. I listen, he has started going to therapy, he journals every night and I try my best not to get involved past a certain healthy amount. It has been months at this point and it’s getting really hard for me to be in this situation. For comparison, I am so happy right now. Professionally and personally  speaking I am excelling and really love what I do. He is really dragging me down with him and I feel really selfish but it’s just exhausting for me. I have said everything here to his face but I’m just looking for advice if anyone else has ever been in this situation. He feels like not the man I decided to date years ago and I know he will figure it out but I’m just exhausted and it makes me really sad for myself and to watch the person you love deeply experience this sadness. Just getting harder everyday to be the supportive partner I know he needs right now. 

Any advice or words of wisdom are encouraged. Thank you!

TL;DR my boyfriend is having a hard time in his life and it’s hard after so many months of listening to the same problems to continue to be a supportive partner. Looking for advice!"
