I lose motivation to go to the gym if my gym partner opts out.,lukeipt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/61s1d8/i_lose_motivation_to_go_to_the_gym_if_my_gym/,53,11,"If my gym buddy says he doesnt want to go that day, I find a lot more difficult to go. I always think itll be harder to do the gym, or think of something better that I could do, and nobody to tell me not to. How do yous deal with it?"
