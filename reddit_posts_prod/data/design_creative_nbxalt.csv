Name or Creative Name for website/social media page,wewillreigns,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/nbxalt/name_or_creative_name_for_websitesocial_media_page/,0,2,I'm looking to upload my work on social media but should I use my actual name or a name I create for my website. I want to add it to my resume so employers can see my work but what is the best option?
