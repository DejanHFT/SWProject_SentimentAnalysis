What movie do people often misinterpret or miss the point of entirely?,adamantfly,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/wozew4/what_movie_do_people_often_misinterpret_or_miss/,2596,1845,I think some of the big ones are Fight Club or 500 Days of Summer but I'm sure there are others out there. My favourite is American Psycho which is such a feminist critique of yuppie culture but somehow became The sigma grindset movie. Adaptations that miss the point are also fair game. For example: the Scarface game that completely changes the ending and thus misses the entire point of the story.
