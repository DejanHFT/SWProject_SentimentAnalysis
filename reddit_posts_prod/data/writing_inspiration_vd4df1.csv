What inspires your scenes?,Raven_V_Black,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/vd4df1/what_inspires_your_scenes/,28,4,"I have been enjoying giving my opinion here over the last few weeks, and I hope I've been supportive and helpful, as I'm asking the same in return. 

The fact is, thinking about the questions others pose has been really helpful to thinking about the mechanics of how I write, and realizing some strengths and weaknesses. 

One of the main weaknesses I have is a lack of inspiration. Some people, if not most, profess to write every single day. I go weeks between scenes myself. I find a song that creates a mood, and turn it into scenario, and develop that into a full scene. It's beautiful, I love what I do. But it's not an efficient tactic for production sake. 

To be more specific, I have a piece of work I am fully invested in. I want to see it through. The first act is where I want it, the ending is tied up pretty well. There's a reasonable amount of plot. But there is also ten year's time to pass between the two. I need to bridge that gap somewhat in order to feel comfortable with the changes that occur, and show the development and aging and all that, without clobbering the potential reader with a swinging boat paddle of change. 

Thanks for your time. I know I tend to get long-winded."
