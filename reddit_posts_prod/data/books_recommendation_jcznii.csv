“Flowers for Algernon” was recommended to me. I accidentally read “Flowers in the Attic” instead.,TodayMilk,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jcznii/flowers_for_algernon_was_recommended_to_me_i/,1058,12500,"I realize this sounds ridiculous, but you need to understand two things:
1. My attention span/short term memory is rather lacking
2. The only things my friend told me about Flowers for Algernon was that it was a moving but incredibly sad book. I had no idea what the plot or basis of the book was, she didn’t want to spoil anything. 

So, when I was on my library’s website and Flowers in the Attic was on the available now list, I thought, “oh, yes, the flowers book. This must be it.”


I’m sure everyone has their opinions about Flowers in the Attic, but uh ... it was not the poignant, thought-provoking read I was expecting."
