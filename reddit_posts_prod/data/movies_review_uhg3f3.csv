As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** 

>	A violent, wacky, drag-me-to-several-different-hells at once funhouse of a film that nudges the franchise somewhere actually new.

-[David Ehlrich, Indiewire](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/05/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-review-1234721308/)

>	In the hands of director Sam Raimi, Multiverse of Madness is a marvellously assured balancing act of bizarre weirdness and affecting human drama.

-[Richard Trenholm, CNET](https://www.cnet.com/culture/entertainment/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-review-horribly-fun-marvel/)

>	Multiverse of Madness isn’t wildly unconventional in its story choices, but the fun it has exploring the possibilities of this narrative makes it a treat.

-[Liz Shannon Miller, Consequence](https://consequence.net/2022/05/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-review/)

>	Though unsatisfying in some respects, the film is enough fun to make one wish for a portal to a variant universe in which Marvel movies spent more time exploiting their own strengths and less time trying to make you want more Marvel movies.

-[John Defore, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-benedict-cumberbatch-1235139596/)

>	Marvel’s most deranged and energetic movie yet, as much of a winning comeback for director Sam Raimi as it is a mega-budget exercise in universal stakes-raising.

-[Dan Jolin, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness/)

>	“Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness” is a ride, a head trip, a CGI horror jam, a what-is-reality Marvel brainteaser and, at moments, a bit of an ordeal. It’s a somewhat engaging mess, but a mess all the same.

-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2022/film/reviews/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-review-benedict-cumberbatch-elizabeth-olsen-sam-raimi-1235256083/)

>	While the MCU’s interconnected nature was once one of this universe’s strengths, now, it almost suffocates what Raimi is trying to do here. As a film that highlights Raimi’s talents as both a director of distinct superhero stories, and idiosyncratic horror tales, Doctor Strange works.

-[Ross Bonaime, Collider](https://collider.com/doctor-strange-2-review-spoiler-free/)
