How do you stay motivated?,anewbeggining,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2d6oo7/how_do_you_stay_motivated/,51,5,"Hello, 
I find it hard to keep working out once I'm at the gym. I consistently cut my workouts short which results in less mass gain, and overall fitness. I'll start my workout do a couple of exercises then want to stop. So i'm asking you, how do you stay motivated while working out what keeps you going?
Edit: thanks for all the tips! I used some today at the gym, and I finished my worked without wanting to quit!"
