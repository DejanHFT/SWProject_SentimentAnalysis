Plastering question,RawToastUK,https://i.redd.it/h1f7n29zhelb1.jpg,0,2,"Apologies in advance for the lack of correct terms, but I was wondering if anyone could say how normal it is the round the join between ceiling and wall when there is a short angled section between wall and ceiling. 

The property is around 140 years old and we've been told its common to do this on older properties when joists and the rafters are very rarely in line or straight so to achieve a straight line is near impossible.

Top left of this photo is an example.

Any help or advice is much appreciated!"
