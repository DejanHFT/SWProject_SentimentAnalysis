"What ways have different historical figures kept, taken, organized, and/or preserved their notes?",ithinkimlinus,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/gy3egm/what_ways_have_different_historical_figures_kept/,149,1113,"*I hope this is the right place for this question. I couldn't find where it has been asked before either. I never post to Reddit, so I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong. 

Anyway, I'm just fascinated by written records and the organization of them. I get chills when I see printed words from even a hundred years ago. Who kept up with it all? I managed to lose every single diary I had in elementary school, yet there's a copy of a drawing Carl Sagan made when he was a pre-teen in this Smithsonian mag I'm reading. 

So what I want to know is, for example, is there somebody out there who knows if Lincoln carried around a box of napkins with speech ideas scribbled on them? Did Eleanor Roosevelt have Composition notebooks with bulleted lists of ways to challenge the patriarchy? Did da Vinci just have all his drawings stuck to a fridge with souvenir magnets that said Rome Spring Break 2005? Were Sagan's mom and dad just hoarders who kept all his school papers? 

I'd also love to hear from any historians or archivists who work with written records. Maybe there's something I can learn to take/organize my own notes better. 

Thanks!

*Edit - 
1. It certainly doesn't have to be a famous person! Any historical records are welcome here! Heck, doesn't HAVE to be historical either, I suppose. I'd be equally as keen to hear how we're organizing and keeping records today!
2. Just, thank you guys SO damn much. I didn't anticipate so many great responses, kind and unique and informative. I found out so much more by asking here than I could have wading into Google without direction. THANK YOU again. Bless, stay safe."
