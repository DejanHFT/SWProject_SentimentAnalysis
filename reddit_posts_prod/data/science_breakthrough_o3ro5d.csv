"Researchers developed a new technique that keeps quantum bits of light stable at room temperature instead of only working at -270 degrees. In addition, they store these qubits at room temperature for a hundred times longer than ever shown before. This is a breakthrough in quantum research.",MistWeaver80,https://news.ku.dk/all_news/2021/06/new-invention-keeps-qubits-of-light-stable-at-room-temperature/,439,25278,No text content
