How do I (25M) to support my newly paralyzed girlfriend (25f)?,Complete_Mountain_78,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q4q1jg/how_do_i_25m_to_support_my_newly_paralyzed/,171,2524,"My girlfriend was recently in a car crash and the outcome is not good. 

The doctors ran their tests and scans. The results of those scans, not good. Her spinal cord was damaged in the T10 and it is a grade a. Which means she is paralyzed from the waist area down with no function. 

This is a huge life changing thing for her. Before, she was a model, we played golf and tennis, ran, hiked and traveled a lot. 

How do I support her through this?

TL;DR - My girlfriend was just paralyzed, how do I support her?"
