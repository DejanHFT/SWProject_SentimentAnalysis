eurrail itinerary help - best european countries for food and adventure?,spacefruittt,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zr7y24/eurrail_itinerary_help_best_european_countries/,5,0,"Hi all! Hoping to fly to Europe next summer with my mother and take an Eurrail trip around west Europe. I know Spain is on my bucket list. Looking for places to try unique eats and experiences, but every country looks like a great choice. We will be in EU for 2 weeks-1 month, planning to fly in wherever's cheapest (but considering Porto, Portugal as our first destination). 

Planning to use the 5 travel days within 1 month pass from Eurrail for $524 (2 people). 

Any ideas or sample itineraries from the country/ies you've visited? We want to keep costs low since its just 2 of us travelling."
