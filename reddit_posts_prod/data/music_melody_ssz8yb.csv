Why are there so many songs with upbeat melody and dark lyrics?,Ok-Impress-2222,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/ssz8yb/why_are_there_so_many_songs_with_upbeat_melody/,15,1,"Pumped Up Kicks, 99 Luftballons, Last Caress, Macarena, Hey Ya, Jump, Mr. Brightside, etc. All these songs, and a lot more, have extremely upbeat melody and extremely dark lyrics. And don't get me wrong, all those songs are awesome, but sometimes I just can't help but wonder...

Why do musicians actually do that?

How does it make sense to accompany an upbeat melody with dark lyrics - or rather, the other way around; dark lyrics with an upbeat melody?

The one reason I can think of is that they want to raise the awareness of the issues adressed in those lyrics, and if they want to appeal to a wider audience, they have to accompany those dark lyrics with an upbeat melody. But I think there's gotta be a more compelling reason than that. (But that's just me.)

Do you know the answer to this?"
