I'm Gary Marcus, a scientist, best-selling author, professor, and entrepreneur.

I am founder and CEO of a Robust.AI with Rodney Brooks and others. I work on robots and AI and am well-known for my skepticism about AI, some of which was featured last week in Wired, The New York Times and Quartz. 

Along with Ernest Davis, I've written a book called Rebooting AI, all about building machines we can trust and am here to discuss all things artificial intelligence - past, present, and future.

Find out more about me and the book at [rebooting.ai](http://rebooting.ai/), [garymarcus.com](http://garymarcus.com/), and on Twitter @garymarcus. For now, ask me anything!
