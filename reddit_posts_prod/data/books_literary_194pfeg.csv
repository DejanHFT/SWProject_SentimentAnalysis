More literary tattoos!,SadBrontosaurus,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/194pfeg/more_literary_tattoos/,91,56,"It doesn't look like there has been a discussion about this since the last time I brought it up, around 6 months ago. I *loved* reading about the tattoos and ideas people have, and want to hear more!

I just got two more last week myself - I've started work on finishing my [literary sleeve](https://imgur.com/a/0Zz1bzM) by getting [Gollum and Smeagol in my left armpit](https://i.redd.it/x0x51mlf6sbc1.jpeg). I'm also working on a white ink sleeve on my right arm, so I got [Nevermore](https://i.redd.it/ljzg5c1e8sbc1.jpeg) in Edgar Allen Poe's handwriting on my forearm. It's opposite the word ""Always"" on my inner forearm.

What do you have? What do you want?"
