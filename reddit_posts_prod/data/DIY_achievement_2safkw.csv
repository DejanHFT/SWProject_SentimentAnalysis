My room is tiny and I want to build a raised platform on my bed. My work have told me I can have as many pallets as I want to achieve this so I've unlimited trial and error but would rather come here for tips.,slidney,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/2safkw/my_room_is_tiny_and_i_want_to_build_a_raised/,6,2,"So ideally I want the bed to be raised about 1.5 meters off the ground to allow for me to store a chest of drawers under there and to hang shirts/suits off the ground. I work in the city and get paid a shit entry level wage so I really need to do this on the cheap. 

Currently my plan is to acquire those pallets and cut them down then simply create a frame out of them. Reinforcing each side with more pallets.

In my head this seems pretty simple but I've not made anything since woodshop class.

Has anyone done this before or got any good resources? Google has some pretty polarising results so thought I'd try here"
