Favorite place for an Amazon adventure?,lukatonio,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/xxwgoa/favorite_place_for_an_amazon_adventure/,2,1,"I'm going on a trip for a few months in Bolivia - Peru - Ecuador   
I want to enter the amazon in one of these countries for an extended period (7-14 days) but not sure yet where, what and how. A tour, a hike, an adventure?  
I'd just love to experience the nature, animals, local communities, be in awe of it all. Preferably not too much tourism, i'm okay sleeping in huts, tents, eating simple, all the non-luxery stuff.   
Some options i researched that are along my route:  
\-May in Bolivia: Madidi National Park via Rurrenabaque  
\-June in Peru: Manu National park (on my route) or enter amazon via Iquitos (far from my route)   
\-July in Ecuador: Coca -> Sumaco Napo-Galeras or Yasuni or Cuyabena reserve 

Recommendations and tips are welcome!"
