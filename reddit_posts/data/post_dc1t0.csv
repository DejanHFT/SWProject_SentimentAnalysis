Do boys even notice lingerie? ,GigglesSunshine,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dc1t0/do_boys_even_notice_lingerie/,1125,482,"I'm a big fan of sexy underwear. I want to get something sort of ridiculous for fun and to be a surprise for a boy. But do boys even care? Would I be getting it just for my own entertainment?

Also, dudes, what's your favorite lingerie on a girl?

PS - seriously, yall don't use the term ""boys""? I feel like a creep. maybe there is some deep psychological reason for this.

*edit: I guess I should maybe try it tonight just for the sake of science (reddit). in order to grow as a society (reddit), we need proper experiments that yield life (reddit) changing data. so I'll let yall know how that goes...*

*update #1: First off, I'm still surprised my affinity for the word ""boy"" is an issue. I had no idea someone would find that odd, let alone lots of people. Secondly, so I think I'm going to start slow. Not really going for the tramp look. I'm a forever thong wearer and so today I went to the mall and tried on boy shorts (what I mostly noticed was a lot of comments singing boy shorts praises) - I thought I'd hate them but they're kinda great. Oh and they're actually sexy too! Go team! Next move: stockings. Soon. Also, lace bras? The most uncomfortable thing in the world. Just FYI. Thanks for everyone's opinions!*"
