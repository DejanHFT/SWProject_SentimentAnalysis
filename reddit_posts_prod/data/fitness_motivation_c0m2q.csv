Lifestyle Change: What made YOU do it? What's your motivation?,phrakture,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/c0m2q/lifestyle_change_what_made_you_do_it_whats_your/,151,36,"I'll start. I met a girl. Wait, wait. Hear me out. I met a girl, and it finally *clicked*. I decided that she was the one I was going to marry. I decided that she was the one I would spend my life with. I decided it was time for children. And all of those dreams would fall flat if I was sick, inactive, and died before things came to fruition. I decided that the best thing I could do, for my future wife and future kids, is be the best person I could be.

So I quit smoking (6 months now), started eating paleo (down 25lbs), began exercising again (martial arts, actually, but who's counting), cut down on computer time, stopped sitting around watching TV, etc.

What made **you** do it?

**EDIT:** I am 5'10"", 171lbs as of today, and just went under 20% BF% this morning. I am currently ""builtfat"" according to the picture thread"
