Fifa online: what manages the AI?,CapozXVII,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/aud0h1/fifa_online_what_manages_the_ai/,3,1,"When you play FIFA online, what manages the AI for the players not controlled by you? The local cpu (so the one installed on your machine) or the cpu for the server? 

I was wondering: if it is true the first case, can somebody use a better cpu (or can overcloak it) to have ""better performance"" for the players controlled by the AI?"
