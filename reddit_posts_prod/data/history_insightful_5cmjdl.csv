Recently taken a strong interest in history. Asking for insight with a debate I witnessed.,Historylearner17,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5cmjdl/recently_taken_a_strong_interest_in_history/,12,1,"Ling time lurker, and beginning to love learning history. Last night, i saw an argument about if the US has caused more suffering due to their ""empire"" than past empires and attempts at empire such as USSR, Rome, Mongols, etc. Both sides made strong points. I do not have enough of a grasp of history to know for sure. US has done some awful stuff, but worse than the past? Thoughts? I want to jump in on the debate. Hope this is the sub for this. Never posted before."
