I would love to travel to Chile, Argentina or Peru this February (I'm a teacher- it's the only time I have a long enough break!). My husband and I are extremely open to any ideas or possibilities- have you taken a 6 - 7 day trip to South America in February that you loved?! We are looking for mountains, delicious food, and to travel consciously. Thank you!"
