What do you consider a flawless film?,harlsey,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16pc1ke/what_do_you_consider_a_flawless_film/,2923,1173,"For my money, Back To The Future is a flawless film. 

The story is flawless.  It is filled with action, fantasy, comedy, drama.  It’s a tale of morality, romance, good overcoming evil, a son avenging a father and most importantly it’s a tale that shows that friendship can overcome anything - even time and space.

The soundtrack is amazing, the acting is perfect, the cinematography is incredible.

I couldn’t think of a critique for the film after all these years and I still can’t. 

What’s yours?"
