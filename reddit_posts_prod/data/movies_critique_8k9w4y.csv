Question about Black Panther and accents.,Dafuqsurname,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8k9w4y/question_about_black_panther_and_accents/,107,94,A lot of time people critique American actors when they do various British or other anglosphere  accents. How were the American actors' accents in Black Panther? I don't have a ton of exposure to various African accents and I was wondering if people who are more familiar thought they sounded good or bad. Also did they use accents from a certain country or did they come from all over the map?
