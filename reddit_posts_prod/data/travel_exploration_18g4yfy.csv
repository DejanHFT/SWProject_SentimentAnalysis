12-hour layover in London. Explore city or stay in airport/lounge?,ToffeeEmpress,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18g4yfy/12hour_layover_in_london_explore_city_or_stay_in/,18,0,"Hi, traveling from the US and will have a 12-hour daytime layover in London from 9am to 9pm on Saturday, December 23. M/F couple. Have done some reading up on this but wanted confirm/ask some questions.

We would like to explore the city, specifically see Tower Bridge as a must if we step out, and also perhaps Trafalgar, Piccadilly, Buckingham Palace, etc. Also want to grab lunch at an Indian or Pakistani restaurant. As US citizens I read we can visit without a visa but will have to submit an ETA.

Given the long layover, will we have to collect our luggage or will it automatically be managed by the airline to our final destination? If we have to collect luggage, where can we store it securely? 

How far ahead of departure should we return to Heathrow for check-in, security, etc.? I’m accounting for 2 hours, is that enough? 

If we are issued boarding passes in the US for the LHR-DXB flight, I read they are not valid to enter airside once you have exited the airport. How will I get through security when returning to Heathrow in the evening?

Giving myself 2 hours to exit the airport after any security/immigration/customs we may have to do upon arrival, and 2 hours again upon departure. That leaves approximately 8 hours.

In reading up on this, Heathrow Express has been suggested for faster travel time at greater cost versus the Elizabeth line. I’m ok with that and plan to buy tickets on TFL soon  if that is still recommended. From what I’ve read I should exit at Paddington and take the Tube to other places and can use tap to pay instead of getting the Oyster card. Will I get back on the Heathrow Express from Paddington to get back to the airport?

Given its two days before Christmas will that mean greater crowds, more traffic, reduced train/tube/retail/food services?

I have Priority Pass, and will also have access to the Centurion lounge for two. Is it a good idea to step out in the cold (maybe rainy) weather and hustle to explore these places? Or is it best to stay put in one of the lounges, maybe take a shower, a nap, and eat airport food while waiting for a 9pm departure?

I have read conflicting info on max time allowed in the lounges. Some say 3 hours, others say if you are in transit that time limit doesn’t apply.

Appreciate any and all advice, suggestions, and tips."
