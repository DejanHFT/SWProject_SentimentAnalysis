I (16) and my boyfriend (16) have been dating for almost a year now and it's been wonderful. He's so supportive, understanding, and patient  with me since I'm a very anxious and quite frequently have ""episodes"" as I call them. ""Episodes"" usually relating to PTSD from past relationships, from Random anxiety attacks (they just happen with no explanation or reason), or when I ""do not good things to myself"". Now I understand I probably sound kinda using but I promise that's not the case. I actually kept everything from him in the beginning but realized that I should probably open up a little bit to him and he really pushed for me to do that and I've been doing a lot better. He'll stay up talk to me and make sure I'm okay and don't plan on doing anything stupid that might harm me. 

However, he makes jokes during these conversations. Here's an example (I'm paraphrasing):

Him:""Hey OP?""
Me:""Yea?""
Him:""you ok?""
Me:""I've just been stressed because [Sad friend] has been having a crisis and finals are really wearing me down not to mention my parents are fighting again and guess who's caught in the middle""
Him:""Aw I'm sorry""
Me:""Don't apologize you do so much for me already""
Him:""yeah but I don't help you enough""
Me:""BF it's ok, I'm just a little tired of everything
Him:*gets quiet*
Me:""BF?""
Him:""Nope not gonna say it *Snickers a little*
Me:*sighs*""what?
Him:""I was going to say, just go to sleep then""
Me:""of course you were""

He would then usually change the topic after I get frustrated, he says it's because i
Of his ADHD, which kind of bothers me to cuz sometimes things left unsaid and I'm left kind of upset. 
I'm not sure what to do is it just me am I being annoying or am I overthinking this I'm not sure I've talked about this before but he still does it. 
What do you all think?
TLDR; my bf makes bad jokes during very serious talks"
