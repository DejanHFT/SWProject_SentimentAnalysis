Do you ever use philosophical contemplation as an alternative to meditation or to help forget things?,squarehouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/122ion/do_you_ever_use_philosophical_contemplation_as_an/,25,33,"Last night I was at work, and I was bothered by a woman who works there who I'm probably showing too much interest in, so I tried to get my mind to wander and I started thinking about intuition.  Some people see intuition as a form of knowledge, for Kant it's synthetic a priori knowledge.  I forget what Spinoza wrote, but I think he thought intuition was the highest form of knowledge, because it's knowledge that you can't justify.  On other hand, I sort of side with Nietzsche that intuition are just incurable beliefs, they don't actually constitute valid forms of knowledge.  Our knowledge of geometry is the textbook example, we can't justify the axioms of geometry, but for Nietzsche those axioms are necessary judgments for the species, even if they are false.  So I started to wonder what *else* does our intiution say?  For instance, the way we all seem to be natural psychologists, and seem to read the emotional states of those around us so readily.  This is the sort of intuition that are both incurable and impossible to disprove.  We intuit that other people have souls for the same reason.

The rest of the night, I actually forgot all about her.  She came up to me near the end of my shift and we spoke as equals.  Philosophical contemplation clears your head."
