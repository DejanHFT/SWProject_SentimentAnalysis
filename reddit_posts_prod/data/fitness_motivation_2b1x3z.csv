Talk about Motivation! How long did it take YOU to get to 500!,SigmaBlue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2b1x3z/talk_about_motivation_how_long_did_it_take_you_to/,108,16,"So I was at the gym yesterday and there was this girl DLing 365 lbs! Shes about 180 and has only been DLing since January! I started in November and just got to 405 and I am 240! This got me really motivated but also made me beg the question,

How long will it take me to get to 500? For those of you who have made the leaps from not doing DL to getting 2 plates then 3 then 4 how long did it take you to get to 5. I can't let this girl catch me!"
