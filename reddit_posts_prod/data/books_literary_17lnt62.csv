What makes a book good/ literary talking interesting ?,Potential_Impress_21,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17lnt62/what_makes_a_book_good_literary_talking/,30,17,"Hi, to put some context and precisions about my question, I was wondering after reading some posts about the worst books Reddit has ever read, what makes a literary work ""good"". 

Of course, I know some of the answers on those posts weren't sincere, some of them would take well-known books in order to win upvotes, others want to prove they are better readers because they are reading "" real mature and adult literature""... Anyways, it was still interesting to see books that I think have some interest and great qualities, despise their low quality compares to great names of literature...and  there will always be someone to say that he/she didn't like those classics !

Now as literature is an art, it is mainly subjective. But that doesn't mean we can't define what is wrong or right in the execution or the idea.

My big question is: how does literary interest is defined ? Can it be applied even to what we consider bad works ? In what resides the greatness of someone's wrinting ?

Sorry for the 8000000000000 words and the expression, I'm a french teen who must go to sleep but won't cuz the phone is better."
