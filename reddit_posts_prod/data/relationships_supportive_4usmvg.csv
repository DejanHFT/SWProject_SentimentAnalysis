Me [21F] with my boyfriend [32 M] of 1 year my family is supportive but my siblings question the age gap,Age_Gap-Throwaway,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4usmvg/me_21f_with_my_boyfriend_32_m_of_1_year_my_family/,58,0,"My family have a good relationship and they a generally supportive of our relationship. They can see my boyfriend is intelligent, well-off financially, and treats me right. However my older sister(34f) and younger brother(19m) just cannot leave us alone during family gatherings about our age gap.

Normally this would not be a probelm but recently my sister was over our house and went into our basement by mistake. Me and my boyfriend have a 24/5(we take two days off) M/s(Master/slave) relationship and he is my dom. This is private and personally and she saw all of our bdsm gear in the basement. She said I was a depraved lunatic and my boyfriend was abusive(impossible because it's consensual) she brought it up in front of the whole family. This was embarrassing for me and I don't want to lose my boyfriend because of this nonsense. She also is a ""radical"" feminist whatever that means and said that bdsm is evil and men who are into that kind of thing ""should be put into jail assault"", she seems mentally unstable. She's always been a little out their but now it seems shes crossed the line with me and I'm thinking of going no contact permanently.

I'm not sure why she would do this and claim I'm ""wasting my youth"", because my boyfriend is very good looking(looks like he's my age tbh) and makes alot of money and treats me well. We even have similar gaming hobbies and both use reddit. We both work and are independent although we live together now, he's such a nice guy I don't understand why she doesn't like him.

My younger brother is just as bad and he constantly claims my boyfriend is taking advantage of me and is using me for sex(lol), my family thinks he's being ridiculous and I agree. My younger brother said men who date women ten years younger are all immature douche-bags(coming from a 19 year old who doesn't work) who can't get a women their own age, which doesn't make any sense because he has dated women his own age as well, not to mention it seems like most guys prefer somewhat younger women and most women prefer somewhat older guys.

My boyfriend is supportive of me despite my crazy siblings and respects my boundaries and doesn't take advantage of me because of my age at all. My boyfriend said he loves me no matter what anyone else thinks, and we both don't think the age thing is a big deal, he takes very good care of himself and looks fairly young for his age and has a high sex drive like me, we get along just fine and literally never fight about anything ever, we're both easy going gaming homebodies.

What is my sister and brothers problems, they both still live with mom and dad.

What should I do about this?

**tl;dr:** My older sister and younger brother are scolding me for my relationship choices, and their arguments do not hold up to scrutiny. 

Why are they doing this and what should I do about it?

#Update:

I had a long talk with my sister over the phone and found out she was just getting into my brothers head. I told her I was done with her and cutting her off, but then she changed her tone. She immediately apologized and said she was just jealous of our relationship and the fact that a guy around her age that she would like to date would rather date someone younger like me. She said she can't help but see younger girls as ""competition"" and I guess it bothers her, and I had no idea.

She did realize he's a great guy who does respect my boundaries, and we had a long talk about my age gap with him and our M/s relationship. We do take breaks and we do discuss everything before hand and we don't do anything I'm uncomfortable with, for the most part people critical of my/our relationship are the sort that think they know it all and have seen it all, they haven't.

As for the gold digger comments...just lol, I never mentioned he was an clothing model and still does fitness modelling he's easily one the most handsome men I've ever seen in my life and he looks like he's my age. There's nothing wrong with him dating me with our age gap imo. My parents are supportive because we've had these talks(I had to after my sister told everyone what was in our basement), and I explained everything to them. MY parent are probably supportive because they are married(have been for over 20 years strong) with a 12 year age gap between them.

Anyway I didn't really get any good advice here other than people telling me how I should live me life and that I'm somehow in an abusive relationship, or that he cannot get a women his own age(lmao), or that I don't know any better but trust me when I say this isn't an abusive relationship by any stretch of the imagination. I still haven't forgiven my brother yet he seems to have no idea how relationships or the world works.

**tl;dr:** Sister explained herself, still angry at them and my brother.
