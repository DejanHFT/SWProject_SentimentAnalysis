How to be a supportive boyfriend when partner is going through a relationship burnout,Axoptian,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/16puerw/how_to_be_a_supportive_boyfriend_when_partner_is/,5,1,"Hey there 19M and my partner 18F have been dating for over one and half a year. Lately she has been dealing with something called relationship burnout and I do tend to overthink and stuff but how can I be there for her without «annoying» her. Is this something normal and if so how many go through this. I love her so much and we used to be so lovely dovely and she had a friend in the dorm she lives at that crossed the line with her with toucing and holding her down and a bit more. And thats when the loss of communication started. 
We are doing long distance and times are tough I just want to return to the day we could say I love you every night and etc. 
If this helps any bit I am a extrovert and shes a introvert.
what should I do and how can I be the best boyfriend in these times?

TL;DR: Girlfriend is going through a Relationship Burnout and I love her so much but she doesn’t want to communicate about it, I want to be the best boyfriend for her but unsure how to."
