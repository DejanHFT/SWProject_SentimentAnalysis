Written Reviews:

>[Zhao is] a master craftswoman, and ""Eternals,"" while too long (157 minutes? really?), is a squarely fun and gratifying watch. 

- [Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/eternals-review-chloe-zhao-gemma-chan-salma-hayek-1235093219/)

>The depth of feeling helps counter the choppy storytelling in this new tangent in the MCU narrative.

 - [David Rooney, Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/eternals-marvel-1235035471/)

>After so many Marvel movies that give lip service to the thornier ramifications of its hero narratives, there's an earnestness to the operatic stakes in ""Eternals"" that somehow helps fuse what's physically spectacular and philosophical about it.

 - [Robert Abele, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/eternals-film-review-mcu-chloe-zhao-angelina-jolie/)

>Utilizing Zhao's penchant for naturalistic environments, ""Eternals"" looks unlike any other Marvel movie and is perhaps the most welcoming for MCU neophytes in forever. 

 - [Brian Truitt, USA Today 2.5/4](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/10/24/eternals-review-new-marvel-film-diverse-but-overstuffed-affair/6128386001/?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&utm_campaign=usatodaycommovies-topstories)

>You walk out in the depressing realization that you've just seen one of the more interesting movies Marvel will ever make, and hopefully the least interesting one Chloé Zhao will ever make.

 - [Justin Chang, Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-10-24/eternals-review-marvel-chloe-zhao)

>It's not exactly boring - there's always something new to behold - but nor it is particularly exciting, and it lacks the breezy wit of Marvel's best movies. 

 - [Steve Rose, Guardian 2/5](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/24/eternals-review-marvel-chloe-zhao-angelina-jolie-salma-hayek-powerpoint)

>It's constantly engaged in a kind of grit-toothed authenticity theatre, going out of its way to show you it's doing all the things proper cinema does, even though none of them bring any discernible benefit whatsoever to the film at hand. 

- [Robbie Collin, Daily Telegraph (UK) 2/5](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2021/10/24/eternals-review-marvel-attempts-push-boundaries-result-insipid/)

>With characters and concepts this strong, Zhao's quite right to take her time. 

 - [Charlotte O'Sullivan, London Evening Standard 4/5](https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/film/eternals-film-review-chloe-zhao-marvel-movie-richard-madden-angelina-jolie-b962030.html)

>This is a film that asks on a grand scale questions we grapple with every day. How do we navigate and understand difference? Why do we value humanity so much when humans often do not seem to value each other? 

- [Oliver Jones, Observer 3.5/4](https://observer.com/2021/10/marvel-eternals-review-chloe-zhao-angelina-jolie-richard-madden-gemma-chan/)

>A mishmash of well-meaning, yet jarringly verbose and bafflingly incoherent nonsense which is only just about saved by some half decent performances. 

 - [Linda Marric, The Jewish Chronicle 3/5](https://www.thejc.com/culture/film/film-review-eternals-1.521860)

>""Eternals"" certainly doesn't lack for ambition, but for now, Marvel -- emboldened by its success -- has reached for the stars without quite getting there.

 - [Brian Lowry, CNN.com](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/24/entertainment/eternals-review/index.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter)

>Eternals may not be the worst of Marvel's movies, but it's undoubtedly the most disappointing.

 - [Nicholas Barber, BBC.com 3/5](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20211024-three-stars-for-chlo-zhaos-disappointing-eternals)

>Director Chloé Zhao's entry into the superhero world is assured, ambitious and told on a dizzyingly cosmic scale- but even it can't escape the clichs of superhero storytelling. 

 - [John Nugent, Empire Magazine 3/5](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/eternals/)

>Can't these movies do anything else? Is it too much to ask the most dominant kind of cinema on the planet to shake things up and challenge itself in a more significant way? 

 - [David Ehrlich, indieWire C+](https://www.indiewire.com/2021/10/eternals-review-mcu-1234673515/)

>While not without messiness and over-plotting that bogs down and overcomplicates the narrative, Eternals succeeds as a vast and unrepentantly serious bit of world building with a moral quandary at its center. 

- [Esther Zuckerman, Thrillist](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/eternals-movie-review)"
