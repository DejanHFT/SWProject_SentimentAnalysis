Pergola post on pavers,randompermutation,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/151iy56/pergola_post_on_pavers/,5,1,"Hi,

I am planning to have paver patio and build a pergola on top. My question is what is the best way to secure the post to the patio. 

Searching online I can find Simpson post base which is provides 1 inch ground clearance which prevents wood from rotting. This seems straightforward to instal on a concrete slab patio but I cant figure out how to use this on pavers

I can think of 2 ways bot of which aren’t great. First is to put the bracket below the pavers. The problem is that post can rot over time since it is few inches below ground. Second option is to raise the concrete post base to level with the pavers and then install the bracket. This works but aesthetically doesnt look pretty since the concrete base is visible. 

Here’s the link for [post base](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Simpson-Strong-Tie-ABA-ZMAX-Galvanized-Adjustable-Standoff-Post-Base-for-6x6-Nominal-Lumber-ABA66Z/100375370) i had in mind."
