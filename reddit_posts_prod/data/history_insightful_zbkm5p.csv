What was history class like before the modern era?,SunsetShoreline,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/zbkm5p/what_was_history_class_like_before_the_modern_era/,95,669,"This is a very broad question but essentially if a person had the means to learn history what would they learn? Did Romans of the 1st century learn about Alexander? Did the Byzantines of the 11th century learn about Caesar? Were there history nerds that were fascinated of ancient Egypt or ancient Rome? What did “history class” look like in the civilizations of Asia? 

I know this is broad but any small fact would be appreciated.

I posted this to r/askhistorians and got upvotes but no one posted a response, so I bring it to you for your insights."
