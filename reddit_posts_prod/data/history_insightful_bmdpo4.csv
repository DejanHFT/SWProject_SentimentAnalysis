"Why is Pickett's charge considered the ""high water mark"" of the Confederacy?",ng52,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/bmdpo4/why_is_picketts_charge_considered_the_high_water/,378,1726,"I understand it was probably the closest the confederate army came to victory in the most pivotal battle of the war, but I had been taught all through school that it was ""the farthest north the confederate army ever came."" After actually studying the battle and personally visiting the battlefield, the entire first day of the battle clearly took place SEVERAL MILES north of the ""high water mark"" or copse of trees. Is the high water mark purely symbolic then?

Edit: just want to say thanks everyone so much for the insight and knowledge. Yâ€™all are awesome!"
