Honeymoon destination for food and adventure,starspangledhat,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/rwn394/honeymoon_destination_for_food_and_adventure/,13,12,"My fiancé and I are getting married at the end of July 2022 and are looking to go somewhere cool for our honeymoon! We’re both very active and love adventures and food and want a honeymoon that combines both. What places have you been to that have both delicious meals and things to do? 

Right now some of our options we are considering are: hut to hut hiking in the Dolomites, delaying our honeymoon to go to Argentina and Patagonia in the winter, and island hopping in Greece. What other countries aren’t we thinking of where you can eat great food and do more than just sit on a beach? 
*we’re excluding Asia from our list because my fiance travels frequently for work and I fly out to meet him in Japan and Thailand so we’d like to see other regions."
