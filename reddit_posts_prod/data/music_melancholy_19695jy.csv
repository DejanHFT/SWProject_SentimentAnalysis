Pick any artist you want. What kind of album do you wish they’d release?,emkr78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/19695jy/pick_any_artist_you_want_what_kind_of_album_do/,37,11,"I’m going with Lana Del Rey. She needs to make something rock, like Ultraviolence, that would be AMAZING. It would also be cool to see a more melancholy type album from her too. What would you choose?"
