Struggling to make Melodie’s,Hot-Bookkeeper-814,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/180pzve/struggling_to_make_melodies/,6,4,"Hi guys,

I recently finished my very first EDM song, it took a very long time. I solely focused on it for months, mixed and mastered it. After I finished it, I just can’t make a good sounding melody that’s equally as catchy.  I have experience in music theory, I even picked up on learning some new scales for a different type of sound, but I’m still having trouble. 

I usually go about writing Melodie’s by drawing out chords, and creating a melody from that. I have also tried drawing out bass lines and making that as well but nothing as catchy. I see all these new songs coming out and a lot of people putting out songs with super catchy Melodie’s. I’ve tried to use other songs as reference. I even have midi packs with generated Melodie’s to use as a reference but not liking it. 

I don’t have any pals in music production, so it’s hard to get ideas from people. What should I do? What are your guys’s methods for making a catchy melody"
