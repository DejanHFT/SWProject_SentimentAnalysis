Does anyone find Whiplash a bit overrated?,Icy-Adhesiveness6928,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18pqkkp/does_anyone_find_whiplash_a_bit_overrated/,61,0,"I've decided to watch Whiplash for the first time after reading a lot of great reviews (some of those reviews even name it one of the best movies of this century so far). I enjoyed the movie (the acting, the pacing, the intensity). However, I still felt a bit underwhelmed since I expected something jaw-dropping and groundbreaking given how high this movie ranks on IMDB. It's just a decent psychological thriller. I decided to read the one-star reviews on IMDB to find out what other viewers disliked about the movie. Their critiques usually revolve around the glorification of sadism and so on, but I've found one review that hits the nail on the head. The review specifically criticizes the script, which felt very clich√©d and predictable. Moreover, I find its striking similarities to Black Swan a bit off-putting. Both films delve into the intense world of artistic ambition, featuring an up-and-coming musician/dancer, a demanding mentor figure, and a rival or competitor poised to replace the protagonist. This is followed by their descend into madness and their ""perfect moment"" as the final scene. The repetitive narrative structure and character dynamics felt uninspired and lacking in originality."
