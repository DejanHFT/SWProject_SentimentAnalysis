Is it just the competition for high grades that affect the quality of learning?,13point5,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/vbcbmf/is_it_just_the_competition_for_high_grades_that/,49,23,"I've heard from many parents and students that students' quality of learning is affected because there is too much competition for high grades and not actual learning.

I'd like to know what others think of this. My opinion is that competition is not the sole factor, there are others such as assessments and grading systems. Below is an [essay](https://www.bharathsrr.com/competition_for_high_grades_limits_the_quality_of_learning.html) on the same.

Learning is a process with a feedback loop, and at the end lies assessments. Therefore, they are a critical factor in the quality of learning. Sadly, with the rise in competition for high grades, the objective of the process has shifted from learning subjects to performing better at assessments.

Students have found that memorizing template solutions and tricks instead of learning concepts give better results because there are patterns to a test's questions. Furthermore, since the objective is to beat the competition, students flock to this method because nobody wants to spend more time and effort learning.

The impact of this method is grave in schools because children are amenable at their age. The more they practice such techniques, the more it will get imbibed as a habit. Furthermore, when they get into adult society, which is result-oriented, it will only reinforce their faith in the method.

Colleges have gradually begun to add more open-ended and indirect questions to their tests, and the situation has improved. However, the problem is extant at all levels of education.

However, if one chooses the wrong grading system, getting rid of patterns can have devastating effects. A relative or absolute grading system would drastically affect the quality of learning.

Suppose the tests are unpredictable in a relative grading system. In that case, many students will settle for mediocre scores to barely pass the tests because they would trust their peers to behave similarly.

On the contrary, if one uses an absolute grading system in the same setting, the students would have no choice but to learn subjects to survive the competition.

Results would be disappointing in the early phases of such a shift, but they would eventually catch up.

One can only see the results as they compound over time because quality demands time and effort. The hypothesis is the same with financial investments, where one needs time and perseverance.

In conclusion, it is necessary to consider factors other than the mere competition that affect the quality of learning. Identifying the crucial factors and tweaking them to produce an effective system is wise to achieve the desired results. Competition in the right environment can help students thrive and encourage them to learn."
