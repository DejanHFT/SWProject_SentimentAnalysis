"I just finished ""Only Lovers Left Alive."" Vampirism aside, nihilistic critique of humanity? (Contains spoilers!)",Billy-Goat-The-Kid,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5dw82f/i_just_finished_only_lovers_left_alive_vampirism/,19,34,"So, let me preface this by saying I really enjoyed the film - the music was great, the atmosphere eerie, and the subtle commentary on the part of Adam, Eve, and the other characters was great.  But I couldn't help but interpret the film as a nihilistic critique of humanity.

For example, Adam and Eve go on and on about how humans are basically immature, destroying the planet, causing war and senseless violence since the beginning of time.  One of them says something to effect of ""Have they started fighting over water yet?  Or still oil?""  ...basically, the idea is to insinuate that years of evolution and exposure to culture have elevated the vampires to a sort of superior being (i.e., civilized ""people"" versus ignorant barbarians).

However, at the very end Adam and Eve decide to either kill or turn the Moroccan couple because they're starving for blood and no long have access to a supply.  Basically, as civilized as they claim to be, as superior to humans, they revert to their animalistic instincts the second their basic needs are taken away - much like the humans they criticize.  If not fighting for oil or water, then for blood.

A bit of a pessimistic view of civilization as a sham, that we're all animals underneath, and brutality continues to repeat itself throughout the ages.  Just my two cents.  :)"
