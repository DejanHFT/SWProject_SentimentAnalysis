The Usefulness of Macro-Perspectives,gamesandthoughtspod,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/8ow27v/the_usefulness_of_macroperspectives/,15,42,"""Though religions and other systems of thought differ in a vast number of ways, one thing that they all have in common is the presentation of what one might call a macro\-perspective of life and the world; an overarching view of life and the world which encompasses and simplifies everything in our experience to some given nature or quality. In Christianity, this would be God’s plan, or the battle between heaven and hell, whereas in Buddhism it would be the reality of all things as impermanent, unsatisfactory (in the ultimate sense) and lacking inherent existence. As one figures out quickly, these different macro\-perspectives are often incompatible with each other, and have big consequences in informing the practices of their subsequent faiths. But, I would argue that the presence of these over\-arching narratives within their respective religions is crucial to the well\-being of those who subscribe to them, and that the absence of a macro\-perspective in one’s life is one of the many ways in which one may come to feel alienated, overly anxious, or depressed – all of which are major problems within modern society.

Consider living a day where nothing goes the way you want it to – days all humans inevitably live at varying rates. In the mind of the person going through this day, the immediate contents of their consciousness are likely to be discomfort and agitation; “I don’t want to do what I’m doing right now”. But, for the person with a healthy macro\-perspective, this discomfort can be remedied merely by taking a step back and reflecting on this day within the context of a much larger picture; “I don’t want to do what I’m doing right now, but all discomfort eventually fades away, and the grand scheme of life is much larger than this day”. It may not get rid of the discomfort one feels, but the suffering induced by the discomfort will be greatly lessened by the sheer insignificance of the pain in comparison to the macro\-context it’s inside of. For the one who has no particular view of existence as nested within a set of principles, though, there is no higher plane of perspective to go to when discomfort comes. That one bad day really is the only thing that matters to them, because conceptually, it’s the only context that their experience is being perceived through. 

This is certainly not to say that all macro\-perspectives are true, or even useful. This is likely what Marx meant when he famously proclaimed, “Religion is the opiate of the masses” – it is possible that people can be spoon\-fed a macro\-narrative which posits all sorts of ridiculous things, and serves no philosophical purpose other than giving them bad reasons to put up with misfortunes in their lives. But one doesn’t need to believe in silly things, or even follow any particular religion, to construct a macro\-perspective that is efficient in preserving one’s well\-being, while also preserving the integrity of rational principles and foundations. You don’t necessarily have to make any leaps of faith to evaluate the universe and existence in ultimate terms. In fact, the macro\-perspective presented by some strands of Buddhism do just that, although there are quibbles about whether the term “religious”, in its common usage, even ought to apply to its adherents. That aside, there are a vast number of reasonable macro\-narratives that could function as a healthy big\-picture lens through which to view the world, while also serving as a stepping\-stone to personal growth and learning. 

Of course, we can’t always live our lives with the macro\-perspective of the cosmos at the very front of our minds – it’s hard to cross a busy street while greatly contemplating the nature of life. So in this way, a type of skill must be developed in knowing when to dance between the macro and micro perspectives of our lives, in order to maximize happiness in a given situation. This isn’t a skill many people talk about as a virtue, but this may be because it’s merely such a default quality of happy people that we don’t tend to notice it much. For the person who can successfully balance the perspectives of immediate, conventional experience of everyday life with that of ultimate narratives and context, one may assume that their discomforts will not be nearly as tragic, nor will their everyday pursuits be too impractical.""
