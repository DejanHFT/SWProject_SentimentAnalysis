"12th year student doing a photometry ""Research paper"" with Kepler/TESS data. Looking for help on how to expand upon my Research question",JonVirtue,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/y7jtmd/12th_year_student_doing_a_photometry_research/,3,7," Hi!  
I'm a 12th year student working on a ""Science project / Research paper"" which all students do in their 12th year of High School here in Sweden.

I've decided to do it within astronomy, and I've been looking to do something with transit data that's already been collected from a telescope like Kepler or TESS. However, I'm struggling a bit to formulate a research question where I would do something more than just simply retrieving a light curve and deriving a couple of properties of a planet candidate. I would like to do something more with it, to at least have somewhat of a genuine research question, but I'm not really sure what that would be.

Any thoughts or ideas are very much appreciated, Thanks!"
