Cities to Explore in Italy's Piedmont Region,thirstayyyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/14ftg7n/cities_to_explore_in_italys_piedmont_region/,4,9,"Hello! I am planning to spend about a week with relatives in Montemagno, Italy in early September, and want to plan some day trips. I've been looking at Asti, Alba, Barolo, and Turin but I won't have time to visit all four and still enjoy being in Montemagno. 

Which two (max) should I prioritize, considering that I will only be doing day trips and not staying overnight? I will also likely return to Montemagno in the future, so it's not like I'll never be able to see the others, but which should I prioritize now to get a well-rounded experience?"
