"Strong, smart, independent female literary characters",literallylibraries,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ayd9zd/strong_smart_independent_female_literary/,60,13,"Ahead of International Women's Day tomorrow and on the tail of World Book Day today who are your favorite female literary characters? And are there any well known 'strong female characters' that you simply don't like?

All the lists I've been looking at on various blogs and websites seem to keep coming up with the same books and characters - Jane Eyre, Hermione Granger, Jo from Little Women etc.

I've nothing against those characters but they feel kind of 'been there, done that' - books we all already know, you know?And many of the suggestions that come up also seem to have a common theme of women overcoming a bad relationship to find their strength (although maybe not the ones I just listed) - I'd really like to find some fresh characters who are strong from the get go!

Currently I'm really enjoying the Assassins Blade series by Sarah J. Maas and I like the main character Celena, she's smart, capable, sassy and independent.

EDIT: I know this has kind of turned into a r/suggestmeabook post which I guess I didn't really realise as I was posting but I'm loving it, thank you for all the recommendations so far!

A couple of my favorites over the last year are *Wonder Woman: Warbringer* by Leigh Bardugo and *The Power* by Naomi Alderman. Also, not so much a strong female character but on the theme of Women's Day a little book I've loved this year is *The Trouble with Women* by Jacky Fleming which is a tongue in cheek illustrated account of the things that have been 'common knowledge' about women throughout history - I actually laughed out loud multiple times while reading."
