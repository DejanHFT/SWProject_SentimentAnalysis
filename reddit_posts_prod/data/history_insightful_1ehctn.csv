"LBJ: Facing a career-killing scandal in Washington, then the shots rang out in Dallas....",dusibello,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1ehctn/lbj_facing_a_careerkilling_scandal_in_washington/,47,203,"This [Fresh Air interview with Robert Caro](http://www.npr.org/2013/05/13/180880018/in-passage-caro-mines-lbjs-changing-political-roles) is full of remarkable insight into LBJ's life and times. Fascinating detail on his experience that day in Dallas. If you can find it, see the great New Yorker article of April 2, 2012 that covers much the same ground."
