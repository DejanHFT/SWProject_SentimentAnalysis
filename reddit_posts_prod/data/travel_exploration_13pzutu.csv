Looking to explore Southern Africa in Sept/Oct,DigbyChelsea,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/13pzutu/looking_to_explore_southern_africa_in_septoct/,1,1,"My friend and I (from the US) are exploring the idea of going to Southern Africa in late September into early October. We'll have a week and a half of time there, and want to know what's possible to explore timewise. Some notes:

* I know South Africa itself is large, and I've read that between Johannesburg and Cape Town, one can skip out on Joburg. Since we'll be coming a long way from the US, we'd love to maximize our time and go to other countries, such as see Victoria Falls in Zambia/Zimbabwe (my friend is really interested in this), Botswana, and Namibia (so many more on our list beyond that, but these seem closest). I know 1.5 weeks is highly unrealistic to tack on another one of those in addition to South Africa, but let me know thoughts.
* Things we're interested in: seeing wildlife, eating delicious food, drinking wine, easy/moderate hikes to see pretty views and nature. My friend is also interested in shark cage diving. 
* I've read a range of things about safety, especially for female travelers. Practicing common sense is of course a given but any specific tips would be appreciated. I particularly read about how renting a car is a great way to get around if going all around South Africa, but that being pulled over by cops looking to be bribed with money can occur."
