Why have we historically been so against communism ?,Fartsandfarts,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5v1plz/why_have_we_historically_been_so_against_communism/,181,54,"So, forgive me if this is the wrong place to post this question. I kind of slacked off/ didn't pay attention in history growing up, but now I'm pretty interested in it. So I've been watching WW2/ Cold War documentaries, trying to catch up. It seems like after WW2, we had this quest to ""enable freedom to all countries"" but it seems to me like communist uprisings in various countries WERE the people uprising, so instead we just squashed the people, in favor of the rich elites to regain power...but we did it in the name of stopping communism? I'm sure it's more complicated than it seems, and please forgive me for my ignorance, would just love some insight, because I'm pretty confused ! Thx. 

Edit: ""we"" meaning the US "
