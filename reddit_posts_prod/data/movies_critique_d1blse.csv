Feel free to cheat and add a few if you need to cause I have a bunch that I left off. So notable mentions:

Creed, Hell or High Water, Sicario, X-Men: DoFP, CA: CW, Sicario, TDKR

Edit: All opinions are welcomed if your top movies are all 63 of the Fast &amp;amp;amp; Furious movies then so be it let me hear what you like!

Edit2: No love for Mandy yet? Nick Cage screaming in his whitey tighties is a classic in books.

Edit3: everybody who’s commenting that this is basic, how about you just share your list instead of critiquing mine? These are popular movies for a reason so why are you surprised?"
