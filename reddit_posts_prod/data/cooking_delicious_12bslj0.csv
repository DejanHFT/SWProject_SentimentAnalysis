What is a delicious potato based dish I can make on the stove top without milk or butter?,sortasomeonesmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/12bslj0/what_is_a_delicious_potato_based_dish_i_can_make/,100,98,"I need to make a potato side dish for passover and realized I forgot to buy any margarine or milk substitute. And I don't have an oven to use. I do have onions, garlic and olive oil up the wazoo, plus some fresh herbs like parsley and chive. Thank you!!!"
