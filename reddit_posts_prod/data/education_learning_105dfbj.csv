Proficiency-based Learning means no homework?,Arcane_Animal123,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/105dfbj/proficiencybased_learning_means_no_homework/,22,25,"I just sat through a discussion with relatives who are largely educators. They discussed a school district they grew up around that no longer assigns homework. They were highly critical of this, saying that the studies behind PBL were highly flawed. 

I wanted to ask people who may have more knowledge on the subject. Is it a good move to get rid of homework? Does it help, or hurt? I'm mostly curious but I may end up teaching in this district, so I have a somewhat vested interest."
