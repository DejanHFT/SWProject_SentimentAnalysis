Counter Question: What is the most historically accurate movie you have ever seen?,Sbliek,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/4q9rf1/counter_question_what_is_the_most_historically/,204,159,I saw the question [What is the most historically inaccurate movie you have ever seen?](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/4q8hn4/what_is_the_most_historically_inaccurate_movie/?st=ipzjv2io&sh=0d6a33e3) on this sub earlier today and was actually wondering the opposite. It seems like a lot of directors will choose entertainment or spectacle over an accurate depiction. I remember reading somewhere that [Bloody Sunday](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280491/?ref_=nm_knf_t3) was historically pretty accurate. So what are some more movies that are you think are really historically accurate?
