"""creative"" Dress Attire",sneezypanda,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/2a06en/creative_dress_attire/,9,3,"For my design internship/job (don't ask, but yes i do get paid) I was told to dress ""creative."" I work with non-designers as well and they were told to wear shirt and tie. So I'm trying to figure out what best to wear for this job. I've been trying to keep my beard trimmed, wearing nice graphics tees, and nice shorts. This hasn't seemed to bother anyone but I can't help but feel like there is something more appropriate out there. 

I'm trying to avoid picking up polos (not really ""my thing"") or plaid button ups (because who doesn't own 50 plaid button ups nowadays.) 

This all is absolutely no problem in the winter when I can wear nice jackets and pants, but I can't stand to wear jeans for even a minute in the middle of summer. 

I suppose I should just suck it up, but I wanted to see if anyone had any creative suggestions to stay looking professional in the summer without having to be wearing winter-like attire. "
