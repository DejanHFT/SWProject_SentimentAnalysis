Can killing in the name of good be justified when innocents may also be harmed?,The_Unk0wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/18qar5/can_killing_in_the_name_of_good_be_justified_when/,8,1,"During a sleepless night, I typed this out. It is a description of my internal conflict with being a contracted hacker for the government and the morality of my actions. 

**Background Info:**
I am 17. I work for a network security company that does contracting for the government. My work involves gaining access to a specific target using vulnerabilities in consumer devices. Since I do not a have a clearance I am given no information about the target.

**Start:**
I want to know I’m doing the right thing. Because what I do makes me a killer. Not directly, but ultimately what I do may or may not end someone else’s life. Work that I do with law enforcement can put a pedophile behind bars or work with the military can put a bullet through someone’s head in Afghanistan. It wasn’t like this before. Before, it was just the excitement of solving the puzzle, finding that one flaw that would give you unauthorized access. It didn’t feel quite real, at least not until the sudden realization that what I am doing actually affects people’s lives. The realization changes the “I just bypassed the security on that webcam” to “I just got a visual id on the target.” It’s been some months since I realized this and now I can’t stop asking myself the question: “Am I doing the right thing?” 

Personally, I do not believe that our government always makes the right decisions. Our elected officials are people just like us and are likely to make decisions that further their own agenda rather than do the “right” thing. Most of the time, there is no consensus on what the right thing is. There is so much conflict within the government that I cannot believe that without a doubt, the actions it makes are completely justified. What I do to help it can either be good or evil. Did hacking into some foreign computer network help the military kill someone? Maybe. Was he a terrorist? Who knows. I’d like to think that by providing the military with more information, I make it less likely for them to make a mistake, but I can’t be certain of that and I can’t be certain that the target deserved to die. 

So how do I justify my actions to help an entity that punishes people when my faith in its ability to do so fairly is lacking? I have to assume that it makes the correct decisions. I need to tell myself that when my software breaks into someone’s home network, that I am helping society by removing those who cause harm. I tell myself that each network I break into means that there is some little kid won’t be hurt. That one girl won’t have to live the rest of her life in silence and shame because she is scared to speak out. I pray that my work isn’t being abused to help spy on those who are innocent or worse, kill those who are innocent. It’s a huge burden that I place on a single assumption.  

I need to feel verification that I have done the right thing, that even if someone was harmed because of me, it was worth it because many more avoiding suffering. This need makes the words people that say to me have so much more meaning than they intend. Acceptance by others is verification that I have done the right thing while rejection proves that I have made a mistake. Hearing someone say that they trust me puts me in a blissful happiness. On the other hand, the words, “You’re not the right one for me. I just want to be friends” becomes a soul-crushing “You had good intentions, but you have made a terrible mistake and I can’t accept that.” Being aware of my unwarranted translation does nothing to mitigate the feelings it stirs up. I vividly remember a breakup where I was told, “I feel like you are using your depression to take advantage of me.” The shock that put through me was enormous. I had been able to feel like I was doing the right thing by demonizing rapists, pedophiles, generally anyone who takes advantage of others for sex. Now, to be heard that I was one, completely ripped my mind apart. Someone that I cared for did not want to be with me because she thought I was one of them. The rest of the day was spent contemplating quick and painless ways of suicide while a friend ineffectively tried to convince me that it wasn’t true. Honestly, the only thing that saved me was probably the fact that I felt so useless that I couldn’t bring myself to do anything.

Dealing with people has an extra level of difficulty, especially with people who don’t quite understand what I do. It seems that whenever people at school talk about me, the subject is always how much money I make. I have even had several people I do not normally talk to come up to me and inquire about my yearly salary. One such person even friend requested me on Facebook shortly after asking. This question disgusts me. My work decides if people live or die and people’s main concern is gossiping over how much money I make? Is only my pay important? How about catching those pedophiles, is that important? Is it worth the damage I might cause? Am I causing other people’s deaths for the money? I hope not. Just the idea of it sickens me. So I started using a large portion of my paycheck to buy toys for kids in hospitals. I remember when I was learning to program, my brother was in the hospital. The everyday before visiting him, I would frantically be programming a game to let him play on my laptop when I went to visit. He was so excited when he got to play my simple board game. I hope the money I got from my gamble at least brings a smile to others like the one my brother had. At least this helps me hold on to what sanity I have, but the toll this conflict is having on me is becoming more apparent.

I go through most days robotically. I wake up in the morning, go to school, go to work, go home, pass out, then stay up all through the night. Why? Sleep is a curse. I only sleep when my body can no longer handle being awake any longer since my dreams are painful. Some nights I dream of being punished for the fates I’ve brought to others, some nights I dream that I can no longer handle it and kill the ones I know who are guilty, and some nights I dream I am back in the asylum where I belong. If I am lucky, I don’t dream. I am in a different state of mind every day. I may go a few days feeling on top of the world while, on other days, I feel wretched and useless. 

I don’t want to hurt anyone. I can’t stand being unable to control my thoughts and feelings. I can’t help but let my personal relationships be intertwined with my conscience. My aim has always been to protect those who cannot protect themselves and spread happiness to those who suffer. The constant conflict in my mind leaves me lost and confused. I am sorry to those around me that I hurt because I am blind and those who I do not know because I am mistaken. Am I doing the right thing? Did I make the right choice?"
