My [26M] wife [25] came out to me as trans 3 months ago. Trying to support her but I'm blind sided and feel destroyed. Please help,wife_is_trans,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3a7jdr/my_26m_wife_25_came_out_to_me_as_trans_3_months/,356,1325,"First, I want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people. I believe they deserve the same rights and courtesies as all cis-trans people. If I use incorrect terminology I sincerely apologize as I have zero intention to offend trans people.

That being said, I've been with my wife Claire for a total of 4 years. Dated for 18 months, was engaged for 6, and married 2 years.

3 months ago Claire sat me down and said she had something to tell me. That she is really a man trapped in a woman's body, that she has known this her whole life and she can't ""lie to herself"" anymore. That she has to make a transition or she will be ""emotionally crippled.""

I didn't know what to say. I was just numb and quiet. Claire never once mentioned this while we were dating or engaged or during our marriage and I never once suspected. I managed to ask how far she wanted to take this and she said ""all the way.""

She begged me to at least stay with her through the transition process and to give the marriage time to adjust to the change and I agreed to try.

So, Claire is now Caleb. She got rid of all her clothes. She started hormone therapy immediately. She bought an entire new wardrobe including underwear all from the mens department.

She has stopped shaving everywhere and is letting her facial hair grow out. She got a very masculine haircut. She sold all of her jewelry and the only thing she has kept is the engagement ring I gave her. She no longer wears it, just the wedding band because the engagement ring is too ""girly.""

Reddit...I'm miserable. The more Claire transitions into a man, the less attracted I am to her and the less love I feel for her. I'm trying so hard to be strong for my wife but I feel completely lost and blindsided.

My wife has always been a bit of a tomboy but I know plenty of straight female tomboys. My wife also liked to wear jewelry, paint her nails and wear a dress or a pretty skirt and blouse once in awhile. Maybe it sounds selfish, but much of my love for my wife was rooted in her femininity. I am a straight male. I do not find men attractive whatsoever. 

I know it might sound dramatic but I almost feel like my wife has died. I feel like there is a stranger living in my home now. Claire, or Caleb rather, still totally adores me but I no longer return that feeling. I realized last night I am starting to feel resentment towards Caleb. I feel like he stole my wife from me, took her away. And I'm very upset that Claire/Caleb never told me this before we got married. If she has known this her whole life, why didn't she tell me? I almost feel like she wanted to trap me first.

I am Caleb's everything. His rock, his sole source of emotional support. He has lost a lot of friends due to this transition and he says I'm all he has, which feels like a tremendous amount of pressure and guilt tripping. People commend me for not leaving him and supporting him and I feel like a complete fraud.  

Caleb is saving up and has surgery planned for total breast tissue removal. After that she/he plans to get a hysterectomy and finally to get a penis (not sure what the terminology is for that). Of course this is going to cost us thousands upon thousands of dollars. Money that could go to a down payment on a house, into a retirement fund, into savings. If we had kids that's money that could be spent on college educations.

I didn't sign up for this. If Claire had told me about her being trans, as much as I love her, I would not have married her. 

I want out. I want to leave and never come back. I feel so horrible saying this but I can't do it anymore. There's too much pressure from Caleb, too much change too fast and I feel lied too. My wife is gone. I have zero desire for Caleb. We've tried being intimate once or twice and each time I've had to stop. I can't do it.

I guess my dilemma is, would I be a horrible person to divorce Caleb now? I promised Claire I'd give it a shot and at least stay through the transition process but that could take *years.* I now know I'm starting to resent Caleb and I'm afraid I will eventually come to hate him. I feel cruel leaving Caleb but every day I wake up and I'm miserable. I can't even sleep in the same bed with him anymore. I tried Reddit. I really truly tried. I'm still trying. But I feel like a fraud.

Do I owe it to Caleb to stay until he's done transitioning or can I leave now without being too horrible of a person? I don't know how to support him in a marriage. I don't even know how to support him outside a marriage. I feel broken and drained. And yes, I am in therapy.

**TL;DR Wife told me 3 months ago she's trans and wants me to stay through the transition process. I'm trying so hard but I can't do it anymore. She never told me this while dating and I feel blind sided and heartbroken. Would I be a horrible person if I left my wife?** 

*EDIT: I cannot believe how this post took off. Most of everyone has been so kind and supportive. It's absolutely unreal. Honestly the only nasty messages I've gotten are from mostly other trans people, apparently I've been offensive in the way I've referred to my wife and I'm intolerant and a bigot for doing so. I also cannot fault Claire/Caleb for what they did and that Claire/Caleb has done nothing wrong to me. Honestly, reading the supportive messages, the nasty ones from the trans community, what I wrote, and reflecting, I'm just getting angry. All the hateful messages from trans people who say my pain and suffering do not matter and that Claire/Caleb is in no way at fault and that I'm an intolerant bigot has really affected my view of the trans community. I still think all people should have the same rights and courtesies, but I also think that this is a community of angry hateful people I wouldn't want to spend my time around. Once again, I had no intention to offend trans people or my wife but this blatant bashing is really making me rethink my opinion of this community. I will update when I have a chance and when I feel up to it. For all those who were kind and understanding and supportive I thank you. For those who attacked me and called me hateful and intolerant, go fuck yourselves.*"
