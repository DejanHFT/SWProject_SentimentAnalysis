Deadlift goal achieved!,Ulfhrafn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1b2vri/deadlift_goal_achieved/,68,126,"I don't have a lot of people around that understand why I am so excited so I'm sharing with people I know -will- understand.  

For the first time ever, I deadlifted 405lbs today!  

I failed on my first attempt when my grip slipped, but I nailed it on my second attempt.  It took everything I had to get it up and locked, but I did it!

For reference, I'm 42, 6'2"", and 215lbs.  Not bad for an old(er-ish) man."
