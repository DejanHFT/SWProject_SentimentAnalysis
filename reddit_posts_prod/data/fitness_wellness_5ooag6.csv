anyone here suffers or had insomnia and worked out regularly as well?,MaveFilms,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5ooag6/anyone_here_suffers_or_had_insomnia_and_worked/,20,5,"So recently I have been suffering from insomnia. Worse then I've ever had it before. I also got back to working out. What's happens to me is, I work out, dont get the sleep I need, don't feel the ""soreness"" in the morning but until I get some sleep which is when I get home from class. 


Is that a bad thing? I'm hoping eating right and working out maybe somehow helps cure my insomnia. I am going to test out some new things on getting 5-7 hours of sleep at night. But until then, I suffer. Anyone else suffered through insomnia or any other mental type problems while working out?"
