An Update to Rule 3 from your Jackbooted Censoring Overlords: Historical negationism and You!,Cozret,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/8s0kat/an_update_to_rule_3_from_your_jackbooted/,0,4077,"**Historical negationism or denialism** is an illegitimate distortion of the historical record.

Rule 3: **No [historical negationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_negationism) or denialism**

We do not allow posts and comments about fringe hypotheses, false narratives, misunderstood or misrepresented history, genocide denial, and other disingenuous revisionism. They have proven to be magnets for those wanting to push a distortion of historic consensus and/or records. Engaging in historical negationism or denialism will result in a permanent ban.

TLDR: Historical negationism is more than not history, it is an attempt to negate history. Additionally, ""Just asking questions"" is one of the oldest tricks in the book, and we aren't going to fall for it.

----

So, we expect there are two big questions here.

1) Why disallow Historical Negationism? Won't it just be downvoted or shown to be wrong?

At its most basic, we don't allow it because it is more than simply not history, but an attempt to negate history and even in the best of circumstances, their presence in a discussion will result in a thread going far off-kilter as it becomes the dominating topic.

However, we are not blind to the fact that in quashing posts which advocate of such notions, we risk feeding them ammunition as they in-turn complain that we are ""suppressing the truth"". In an ideal world, every time a piece of Historical Negationism was posted in /r/History, a dozen learned scholars would immediately pounce and tear their ""argument"" apart point by point. But simply put, that isn't always going to happen. A lot of their ""arguments"" are constructed in a way that they seem very plausible, which means that often it indeed takes someone with above average knowledge about this particular subject to debunk them. On a userbase as large as ours this also means that we can't reasonably expect everyone to have that knowledge yet. Which in return means that sadly we too often see that it takes a while before Historical Negationism does receive the pushback it deserves. At which point the damage already has been done and the false information has been seeded. This is what people championing such views count on.

Even worse, often enough we see it getting upvoted as well before receiving any pushback, giving it an even greater impression of legitimacy, which in turn means that they get even more exposure. These upvotes originate from a variety of sources; outside brigades trying to push the subject, the earlier mentioned ignorance on a subject and reasons we don't understand ourselves (on a userbase of millions you will always have the group of people that for some reason seem to look for the contrarian view no matter if it is true or not).
So while we would perhaps prefer to see claims quickly and definitely countered, the mod team, which is made up of volunteers, simply don't have the time to do that for every such comment, nor can we reasonably expect that the wider userbase would be able to counter each one either. So in light of that, we would much prefer to see those comments simply removed rather than risk them stand uncontested.

Is that the right call in the big scheme of things? Who knows. But we do firmly believe that given the limited resources available to us, and our stated mission of keeping /r/history a place for real historical discussion, there is no reasonable alternative to deal with it.

2) So, why can't we ask questions about it?

Quite simply, we ban Historical Negationist and people naturally want to defend their causes. Such threads become more of a honeypot and shooting fish in a barrel doesn't really seem sporting.

Additionally, one of the major Negationist tactics is ""just asking questions"" as a round about way of pushing their agenda."
