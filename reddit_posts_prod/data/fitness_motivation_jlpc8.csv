Curious - what's your non-fitness oriented motivation for going to the gym?,2001Steel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/jlpc8/curious_whats_your_nonfitness_oriented_motivation/,130,16,I was just thinking about all the different byproducts that come along with going to the gym besides just the typical losing weight or bulking up reasons.  Mine's being able to get an awesome night's sleep after working out.  What's yours?
