Howdy /r/fitness!

I wanted to give you all an update on my journey to sobriety and wellness. It's 6 months in, and I am very proud to report that I'm still alcohol-free and still hitting the gym.

**Here are my 6 month before/after photos (Kinda NSFW I suppose)**

Height: 5 ft 5 inches

Age: 28

Pounds lost: 30 (165-135)

Bodyfat: 11.5%

**Exercise Routine**

Not long after my original post, I maxed out my small gym's dumbbells (they went to a max of 50 pounds), so I switched to a new routine that places major emphasis on bodyweight and HIIT training:

*Workout A:* Dips, Pike Pushups, Push Ups, Step Ups, Pistol Squats, Dragon Flags, Suspension Tricep Extensions

*Workout B:* Pull-ups, Suspension Rows, Suspension Curls, Suspension delt flies, Active hangs, Planks, Dumbbell Deadlifts

I run this routine twice/week, with a rest day in the middle: A, B, rest, A, B, rest, rest. I do workout on an empty stomach though, as I believe (with absolutely no data to back it up lol) that it helps with burning fat off.

All exercises are 4 sets of 20 (except for the Dragon Flag - if I can get 3 sets of 2 or 3, I'm thrilled haha). For some of them, such as pull-ups, I'll try my best to get 20, but usually, fall short. I try to keep my heart rate up, so I usually power through the workout in 30 minutes or less. I recently bought a 40 lb weighted vest though, so that's causing me to do less reps (10)

&#x200B;

**Diet:**

My diet hasn't changed much, but on the recommendation of many Redditors, I stopped with the Lean Cuisine and started meal prepping fresh meals.

Goal caloric intake – 1,800 cals/day, but I usually get around 1,400 to 1,600.

Macro goals – 150+g protein, under 160g carbs, under 60g fat.

* Breakfast – Breakfast shake (Greek yogurt, protein powder, bananas, fresh fruits, almond milk, and flax seed)
* Lunch – One chicken breast with 1 cup cooked brown rice
* Snacks – Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein (2 scoops), Apples, Oranges, Pears, etc
* Dinner – Flexible, just as long as it fits my macros (Usually a home cooked meal though, my favorites are Pork Tenderloin or Shrimp Stir Fry)
* Pre-bed snack – Carrots, Celery, or the occasional can of Tuna (although once in a while I cheat and have ice cream or of chips...gotta cheat once in a while to remain sane!)

**Supplements:**

* Protein – Optimum Nutrition Whey Vanilla Ice Cream (2 scoops) daily
* Creatine – Six Star 100% Creatine Monohydrate (5g) daily
* Multivitamin – CVS brand One-a-Day Men’s Health Multivitamin (1 pill) daily
* PreWorkout – Six Star Explosion Ripped (1 scoop) only on lifting days

As a side note - you all have been a huge help in my reaching my goals. The level of motivation and knowledge that I gain here is amazing. Thank you all for making my ongoing transformation possible."
