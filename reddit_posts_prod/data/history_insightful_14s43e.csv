"Final Papers due for American Environmental History Class, could use some help and insight!",chosler81,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/14s43e/final_papers_due_for_american_environmental/,2,0,"Hey guys, been on Reddit for a while but made this account today to see if anyone could help me out. Im writing 3 papers for my American Environmental History class and am trying to get some knowledge and opinions on the topics! I find them to be pretty interesting but there is a ton of information to process, and im hoping someone is well versed with one of these issues! Here they are:

1.) Incorporate ideas and data fromRachel Carson's Silent Spring into an essay analyzing the federal utilitarian conservation legislation that followed in the 11 years after the books 1962 publication.

2.) Analyze the motivations for building Glen Canyon Dam as part of the Pacific Southwestern Water Plan and Colorado River Storage Project and the response of the David Brower led Sierra Club to those plans in the 1950s and 1960s. Contrast the views of Brower and and BOR director Flod Dominy(the 3rd encounter in Encounters with the Archdruid) regarding the dam and development in general

3.)Wartime needs have resulted in new technologies hat have peacetime applications, but have also resulted in negative environmental impacts. Examples include: 
Food production for WWI and the Dust Bowl
development of the atomic bomb during WWII
the development and problems associated with nuclear power generation
Illustrate an analysis of war, technology, and the environment during the 20th and early 21st centuries using these examples.





Thanks guys! I hope to see some great posts!"
