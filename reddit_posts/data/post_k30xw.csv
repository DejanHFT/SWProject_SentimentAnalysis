How far are we from a computer surpassing humans in terms of designing the next upgrade for itself?,cedargrove,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/k30xw/how_far_are_we_from_a_computer_surpassing_humans/,23,3,"I was thinking about AI and all that and came up with a little thought experiment.

An engineer and programmer design and then build a computer*.  After each build, both the humans and computer are tasked with designing the next upgrade.  The most efficient** upgrade is then selected and implemented into the next build.

At what point does the computer make a better choice and how far are we from this?  I know that we obviously use computers to model simulations and use this information to build new ones.  I'm more concerned with the computers ability to analyze itself and make improvements which are not merely the result of mathematical prowess, but actual innovation.

What happens when we cross this threshold?

The idea of a computer solving relevant problems which we aren't even aware of is mind boggling.  Though I think I'm confusing our current abilities and how computers are already helping us solve problems like this.
