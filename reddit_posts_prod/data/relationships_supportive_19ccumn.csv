How Do I (36m) support grieving girlfriend (33f)?,ThrowRA1122334455778,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19ccumn/how_do_i_36m_support_grieving_girlfriend_33f/,4,0,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

My (M) partner (F) has been told her grandmother  is at end of life care, that is to say she will likely pass away in the coming weeks

My partner was very close with her grandmother and I know this is hitting her hard 

We've been together 6 months and have a good relationship, we don't live together but see each other every weekend 

My partner suffers with depression, and takes medication... she's currently staying with family meaning I can't physically be with her

My partner has declined my offer to visit, which I fully understand

My partner has, understandably been very quiet, we try and talk in the mornings on the phone for a few minutes but I have to really push her to message me which again i understand.. I keep checking in by text, reminding her I love her, offering support

I hate knowing she's sad and there's nothing I can do to fix it, knowing she's hurt and I can't stop it... I don't know when I'll see her again, it's likely she'll stay with family until after the funeral, again I understand, I just wish I could do more

What I'm asking is... what more can I do, or what would you do in my situation? I just want to help

TLDR

How can I remotely support a partner handling a family member who is dying 


Thanks in advance, and sorry for the long message"
