"The Uncertainty Principle is About a Fundamental Inability to Know Position and Momentum, Not an Instrumental/Technology Limitation. But aren't those indistinguishable empirically?",FormerDemOperative,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6pjy2u/the_uncertainty_principle_is_about_a_fundamental/,51,20,"Basically what the title said. I understand it's a common misconception that the Uncertainty Principle is about instrumentation rather than a fundamental aspect of the universe, but isn't it empirically impossible to verify that?

Meaning that a universe that has an Uncertainty Principle would be indistinguishable from a universe that has no UP, but instrumentation/measurement interference keeps you from measuring both to an arbitrary level of accuracy. 

Any experiment would give identical results for both possibilities, right? How is this resolved? 

Thank you in advance!"
