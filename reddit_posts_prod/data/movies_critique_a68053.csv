"A lot of the negative critiques of Blackkkansman portray it as too hamfistedly against white supremacy and drawing too direct a line to today, am I wrong for seeing subtlety where there was none?",DrGoodSex2,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a68053/a_lot_of_the_negative_critiques_of_blackkkansman/,22,23,"Specifically, it appeared to me that the film attempted to add some sobriety to some of the edges of the black power narrative in subtle and compelling ways that seem to have been taken for literal support, rather than the potentially satirical portrayals it intended to be, no?

Without going into too much specific detail for fear of spoilers, I guess one of the areas that stuck out was where (forgive me, I don't remember character names well), the main character meets with the woman of the black power movement and continues to argue that not all police are inherently evil, even if the structures they operate within maintain racist tendencies. There were similar moments throughout, but it felt to me like Lee's portrayal of the white supremacy was clear and obviously over-the-top by intent (obviously heinous movements requiring some obvious criticism), but the subtler moments of introspection seemed to have gone a bit missed. 

Or am I going crazy?"
