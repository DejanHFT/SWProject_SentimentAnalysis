How do you balance creative time with self-promotion?,Kryptik_Fox,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/ojs5yz/how_do_you_balance_creative_time_with/,5,3,"Ok, so if you identify as an artist you probably have to do some self-promotion. I find that I have to reach out more or less weekly in order to get events on the calendar. Applying to festivals, applying for grants etc is another thing on top of that. I'm in my 40s and although it seems a bit easier than it used to be I still get ghosted and rejected. And weirdly it still hurts and it still annoys me wasting time sending off an application to get nothing in return. How do you guys manage it?"
