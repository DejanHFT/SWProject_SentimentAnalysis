I'm conducting a research project on mindfulness meditation and could use some advice.,primetimetush,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/1axjvq/im_conducting_a_research_project_on_mindfulness/,8,16,"In our study, we're going to ask partipants to meditate for 4 weeks both at home and in our lab using guided audio CDs to assist them. There won't be a formal meditation class or pro instructor, so the CD will be doing the majority of the instruction. What are your preferred mindfulness meditation CDs? Recommendations?

Jon Kabat-Zinn, Jack Kornfield?"
