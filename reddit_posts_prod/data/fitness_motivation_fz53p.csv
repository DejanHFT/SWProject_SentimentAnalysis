My motivation,afitterme,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/fz53p/my_motivation/,51,111,"Hi there Fittit.

A year ago I posed to r/HealthProject my motivations for losing weight.  Over the next year, I ended up relying on r/fitness way more than r/HealthProject.  I'm coming here to re-up my dedication to myself.

""I just started my fit day account. Looks helpful.

I am a 26 year old female. I am 5'6"" and weigh 231 lbs. My BMI is 37.28

I'm tired of feeling awful when I read men making fun of fatties on Reddit. I'm tired of not being able to shop with my girlfriends because I'd have to tell them my dress size (18-20) Mostly, I'm tired of trying and then giving up.

Fuck you fat. You are out of here.

Edit: I'm starting with small goals.

Weigh 210 lbs by March 30. That's 1.63lbs per week.

Cut down alcohol intake. I'm not sure by how much, I haven't sorted that part out yet. This is to cut out calories, but also because I drink too much and it's unhealthy in general.""

I got down to 180 as of 3 weeks ago.  In the last 3 weeks I totally fell completely off the wagon and gained 7 lbs or so.  Today is the day I put my foot down and say FUCK FAT again.

**March 7th, 2011**

I am a 27 year old female, I am 5'6"" and I weigh 185lbs.  At my lowest weight, I was 177lbs.


Being simply ""overweight"" and not obese is not enough.  I owe it to my body to be healthy.  I know that I can do this, without question.  I want to be strong, and I want to be proud of my body, not simply unashamed.


* I will start tracking my calorie intake with FitDay again

* I will drink less, eat fewer carbs and eat lean, healthy protein.

* Boredom is not an excuse to eat.

* My new goal is to weigh 155 by September 1st.  If I did my math right, I think that is 1.2lbs or so per week, which seems reasonable.

Anyway, I'm not sure if this belongs here, or if it is helpful for anyone else, but I need to put it out there in writing somewhere.  Thanks r/Fitness for all you have done for me, and all you will continue to do in the future."
