It was a mistake a delicious mistake.,oziahrobert,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/19bz06s/it_was_a_mistake_a_delicious_mistake/,3,1,"I was trying to make mayonnaise & I had herd some recipes that keeps the yolks so I kept them,
After I cracked the eggs I realized wee only had coconut oil so I poured the oil in (I live in a warmer climate so usually the coconut oil is liquid)
Blend it and slowly watched it solidify???

I opened it and tasted it and it tasted like butter????
ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE SOFTENED BUTTER (with a hint of coco nut)

It's a weird and difficult to spread because it's chunky but I think that happened because I think the whites of the egg and the yolks of the egg mix with the oil separately? and together somehow??

BUT I think I can fix this by blending before and after (will up date results soon)

Has this happened to anyone else, is this a real thing or is this my happy accident?
