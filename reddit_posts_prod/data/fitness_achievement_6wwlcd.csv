Mantaining the achievements question,CosFukU,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6wwlcd/mantaining_the_achievements_question/,3,1,"Hey all, im new to reddit and fitness too, i tried searching beforehand but didnt find any answer which entirely covers my questions.

Im planning to start going to the gym, but actually i can afford only a few months and i havent any other gym to choose between. If i make X amount of gains (strength/muscle), do i have to keep working out at the same intensity to mantain my desired body? (Aesthetically talking) 

If so, is there some way to keep my gains with bodyweight exercises?

If it has any utility, im 172cm and weight about 69kg

Thank you all in advance!"
