Is Shelby Foote's *The Civil War* Trilogy worth reading?,AssOfARhino,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/8nbaot/is_shelby_footes_the_civil_war_trilogy_worth/,47,19,"I got the box set of Shelby Foote's *The Civil War* for my birthday about 4-5 years ago and never got around to reading them. Recently, I've been wanting to read books on the Civil War (ones I didn't read in college) and wondered if I should eventually give Foote's books a go. 

The dilemma I have is that not only are all three books long as hell, but I understand that historians don't view his books to be accurate. His citations are messy and it's just poorly cited, he has some Lost Cause/ Southern sympathy views (I'm not sure if that's totally reflected in his prose but in interviews he expressed them), and it's overall not being painted as anything essential. It sounds like pop history with problematic views. 

My problem with the length is that I don't want to invest such a large amount of time to a trilogy of books that are poor history when I could be reading more accurate and insightful books. I've heard his prose is beautiful however. Is it at least fun to read and/ or worth while in a historiography sense? Or is there something else I could get out of reading these books regarding valuable knowledge/ understanding of the war?   

Edit: Sounds like I have 3,000 pages to read (which also sounds fun). Thanks for the responses! "
