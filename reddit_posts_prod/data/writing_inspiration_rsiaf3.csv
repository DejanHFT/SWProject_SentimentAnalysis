how do you find the inspiration to write?,kachkodzob,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/rsiaf3/how_do_you_find_the_inspiration_to_write/,11,3,"I have all these ideas, but when I actually open up a document to write my head blanks. I lose all my drive and inspiration for my ideas because I don't know how to start them. I feel like all I need is just one big push, but I don't know where to search for it. It's so annoying. Any advice to combat this?"
