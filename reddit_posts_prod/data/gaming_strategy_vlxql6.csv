Are Turn-Based Strategy Games still 'Old & Boring'?,Arcad3GEEK,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/vlxql6/are_turnbased_strategy_games_still_old_boring/,29,2,"What's the consensus on this subject, and is there one now? Not too long ago it felt like every RPG had to have hack and slash action or it was old and tired and ""nobody plays games like that anymore"". Is that still the case, or was it ever really like that to begin with?

Personally, I LOVE turn-based action in RPGs and elsewhere. In fact, I count *Wargroove* and *Gears Tactics* among my favorite games ever. While, on the RPG side, games like *Octopath Traveler* and *Triangle Strategy* are much smaller games with a smaller appeal, Yakuza just became a dedicated turn based series, and that's a well established franchise. I mean, I've never played Persona, but isn't that Turn-based too?

If you like to chill and eat, or put your controller down here and there for a sip of coffee, there's nothing better than a turn based game, imho. But, if you're convinced that gameplay style is lame and dated, go ahead and take the time to set me straight."
