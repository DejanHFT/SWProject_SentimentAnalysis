How can I get my wife motivated without insulting her?,DontTrustTheChef,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2deb0n/how_can_i_get_my_wife_motivated_without_insulting/,103,33,"A little about us. I am a former MMA fighter and BJJ trainer that decided one day I loved food. With a wife that can really cook, and back to back pregnancies,  we ate...A LOT! As of the past 3 months, I've dropped 21lbs and workout with intense cardio about 5 days a week. My diet is in check and I have been doing very well with my self controll.

Well, she is having a little harder of a time getting motivated. She watches me eat well and workout, but can never seem to stick with it more than a few days. Honestly, I'm kind of worried about her. I would love some advice in this.

Thanks so much for any advice!"
