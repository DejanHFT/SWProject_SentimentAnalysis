What movies should I watch understand the history of cinema?,tgood123,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16bhiuq/what_movies_should_i_watch_understand_the_history/,121,11,"I've been starting to appreciate how movies are made recently. I enjoy watching older films to see what kind of effects, writing and acting methods they use. So I would like to watch more movies where it was it's first of its kind and changed cinema throughout the years. I think the oldest film i've seen is Nosferatu and even though it was a silent film, I was still interested to see how they made that movie and was entertained. I've started watching more movies made in the 50s as well. 

I would love any suggestions. Even if they are weird and quarky ðŸ™‚"
