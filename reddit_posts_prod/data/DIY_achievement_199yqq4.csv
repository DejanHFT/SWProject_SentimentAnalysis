Paint Markers + Upholstery?,Clear_Enthusiasm_176,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/199yqq4/paint_markers_upholstery/,2,1,"I’m thinking of using paint markers on my upholstered headboard (cream colored) to create a chinoiserie-like pattern. I’m an artist, so I thought this would be a fun way to achieve the look I want.

I tried to search examples of others who have done this and didn’t find any references or tips for this project. (I found lots of all over paint projects on upholstered furniture, but no paint markers that keep the same ‘base’).

Any ideas/tips for making the the paint markers long-lasting OR references would be helpful!

PS: Should I just find fabric and re-upholster it? It’s a simple square shape."
