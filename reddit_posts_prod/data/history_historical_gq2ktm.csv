Observe a historical battle....,scp1717,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/gq2ktm/observe_a_historical_battle/,961,2058,"If you were able to time travel and observe (invisible and untouchable) any historical battle, which would it be and why ?
Let's keep it simple and say it was a battle that was concluded more or less in one day.
A siege or a prolonged conflict such as Stalingrad doesn't really work.
For me it would maybe be Cannae for the scale of the battle and the tactics employed by Hannibal. Also, as brutal as it must have been, I would like to see how the legions fought on when they realised they were surrounded and a rout or escape was not possible. Men fighting to the death like that must have provoked fierce and desperate combat.
Second place maybe Bannockburn (as I'm Scottish) and because of the outmatched smaller Scottish army beating the larger and better armed force using terrain and strong leadership to triumph."
