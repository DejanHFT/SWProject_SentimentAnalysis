Exploring the Yucatán peninsula,Smeuthi,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zudcam/exploring_the_yucatán_peninsula/,6,3,"Hi, just looking for some advice on this. I'm flying in to Cancun in a few weeks and apart from visiting Valladolid and maybe Merida, all I really want to do in the area is visit cenotes, beaches and ruins. I know the bus services are decent but would I be better off renting a car? Are there many great cenotes and ruins that I wouldn't get to without my own car? Or is it like when you've seen one you've seen them all? I would imagine it costs quite a lot more to rent a car than just using buses so I want to make sure it's worth it to do so. Would appreciate some insight from anyone who's got experience. Thanks."
