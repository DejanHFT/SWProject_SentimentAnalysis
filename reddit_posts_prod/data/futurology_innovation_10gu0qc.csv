Any resources that give an overview of innovation in different aspects of science?,yokiano,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10gu0qc/any_resources_that_give_an_overview_of_innovation/,6,14,"I'm missing some kind of website or even app that tries to follow all major disrupting technologies and gives some kind of 'how it all connects'. Ideally, it would be visually presented, interactive, and up to date.

Have someone from this respected forum might encounter something like that?"
