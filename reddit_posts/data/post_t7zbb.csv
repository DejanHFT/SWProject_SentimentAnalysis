"What is the feasibility of creating a Jarvis-like AI for your home, office, etc.?",Badwolf84,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/t7zbb/what_is_the_feasibility_of_creating_a_jarvislike/,4,1,"Just channel surfing and came across Iron Man (which I always have to watch). Just wondering what is the possibility/feasibility of creating a Jarvis like system/assistant for a person's house, office, or whatever?

Is this something that is at least somewhat in the realm of possibility?"
