"Great inspiration, no motivation",anxious_panda,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1jq9v3/great_inspiration_no_motivation/,37,35,"Have you ever had a plot that pushes itself to be written? Or a character whose story begs to be told?

I've been trying to come up with an idea for a novel since I was a teenager, but I always ended up with half-assed plots and two-dimensional characters.

And now, many years later, an interesting character formed himself in my head, and his story is getting clearer and clearer each day. I know the beginning, the end, and everything in between. For the first time in my life, I think I finally have something worthy and complete to tell.

Isn't this what most writers want? To be suddenly seized by an inspiration that wouldn't let them go unless they act on it? 

I feel that it's a loss not to share the life of this character who appeared fully realized in my mind with his story already completed. But I'm scared to write it down. I'm scared that I can't bring justice to the story, and that my execution would suck.

Why is it that in my head, everything is so clear like a movie, but when I try to translate it into words, it's not happening? 

I just want to be able to write his story, though, even if it's just for myself. :("
