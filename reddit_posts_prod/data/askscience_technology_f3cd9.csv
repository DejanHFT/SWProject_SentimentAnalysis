"If sentient marine life were to evolve, say, on another planet, would they be able to advance as far technologically as humans?",capnthermostat,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/f3cd9/if_sentient_marine_life_were_to_evolve_say_on/,68,52,"This question occurred to me when I was reading a post awhile ago about how dolphins are now considered more intelligent than chimpanzees. It doesn't seem inconceivable that on another planet that marine life could evolve to have human level intelligence, but would their aquatic environment stifle technological innovation? Shelter wouldn't be necessary, nor would the wheel, and fire, along with the advances that implement it such as metalwork would be impossible, so would the species be able to advance beyond the the tribal stage of our stone age ancestors? It's an interesting topic to me. 

Tl;dr How far could sentient marine life advance technologically?"
