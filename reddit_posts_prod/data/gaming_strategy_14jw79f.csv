I Miss Strategy Guides,AmaltheaPrime,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/14jw79f/i_miss_strategy_guides/,36,50,"Does anyone remember when strategy guides were a normal thing that got printed to go with game releases? 

I know all that information can be found online now but I miss having physical copies that I could make notes in and follow along. 

I buy every one I can find nowadays if I have the game it goes with - I just love having a physical guide I can go through and not worry about missing anything."
