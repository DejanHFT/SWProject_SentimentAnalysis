Really struggling with coding in cs degree,alk-e,http://www.google.com,10,0,"I’m a junior/senior in cs major and I seem to understand the conceptual and theoretical aspects but when I have to actually implement I really struggle. There has been so little application of actual coding so far. I know I should be coding on my own time, but I have so little of that. What would you guys recommend as far as practice or otherwise to prepare for the future? Am I just screwed? I’m very worried I won’t graduate or be able to get a job."
