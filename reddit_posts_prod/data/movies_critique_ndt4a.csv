"I have to put together a film critique class for my High School. Any ideas, Reddit?",Roundy210,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ndt4a/i_have_to_put_together_a_film_critique_class_for/,45,17,"Essentially, my teacher sprung this on me yesterday, and I love the idea but have no idea where to start. Basically the only guidelines I've been given is that the class wil be 1 hour and 30 minutes total a week, and (for the most part) I can't show any R-rated movies. I've got to get a summary of the class written up by Friday."
