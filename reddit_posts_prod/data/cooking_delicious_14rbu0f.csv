Hey fellow foodies! I wanted to share a fantastic recipe I recently discovered that combines the freshness of lemon, the aromatic flavor of garlic, and the succulent goodness of shrimp. This Lemon Garlic Shrimp Pasta will have your taste buds dancing!

**Ingredients:**
- 8 ounces of linguine or your preferred pasta
- 1 pound of large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons of butter
- Juice and zest of one lemon
- 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley
- Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**
1. Cook the linguine or pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
2. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3. Add the shrimp to the skillet and cook until they turn pink and opaque, approximately 2-3 minutes per side. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Remove the skillet from heat and squeeze the lemon juice over the cooked shrimp. Add the lemon zest and chopped parsley. Toss to combine, ensuring the shrimp are evenly coated.
5. Add the cooked linguine to the skillet and gently toss with the shrimp, garlic, and lemon mixture until well combined.
