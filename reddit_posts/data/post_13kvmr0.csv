"AskScience AMA Series: I'm Karestan Koenen, a licensed clinical psychologist, author, and professor at Harvard where my lab focuses on research and training around trauma and mental health both in the US and globally. AMA about childhood trauma and the effect it can have on our mental health!",AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/13kvmr0/askscience_ama_series_im_karestan_koenen_a/,257,1921,"Over the past twenty years, I have conducted research on trauma globally. My work has focused on the following questions:

1. Why, when people experience similar traumatic events do some struggle while others appear resilient?
2. How do traumatic events get under the skin and cause physical and mental health problems?
3. What can science tell us about how to help people recover from traumatic events and thrive?

Today, I have partnered with Number Story to raise awareness around the role of childhood trauma and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and their long-term effects on mental and physical health.

Excited to answer any questions you may have. My goal is for you to leave filled with hope and equipped with healing strategies for yourself and loved ones. **I will be starting at 1pm ET (17 UT), AMA!**
