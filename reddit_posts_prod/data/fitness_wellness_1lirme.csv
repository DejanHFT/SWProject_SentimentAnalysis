"Foam rolling video - What is it, why should I do it, and how do I do it?",stevenconrad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1lirme/foam_rolling_video_what_is_it_why_should_i_do_it/,109,528,"I work as a trainer at a small studio and we just started making videos for our clients. I wanted to share our foam rolling video because I think it could be a good resource for anyone needing to learn about foam rolling and how to do it properly. 

Foam rolling is a form of self massage that helps break-up soft tissue restrictions around the muscles and joints. Using it properly can improve mobility, reduce joint pain, and improve overall wellness of the muscles.
