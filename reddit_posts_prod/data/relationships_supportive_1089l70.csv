I’m (29m) struggling to be supportive of my partners (27f) ADHD symptoms in day-to-day life.,uneasystudent,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1089l70/im_29m_struggling_to_be_supportive_of_my_partners/,86,114,"My girlfriend is a wonderful human, she’s creative and kind and I love her to pieces. However she’s recently been diagnosed with ADHD and Autism and it’s lead to her habits becoming worse and worse down a slippery slope. She hates her job, and because it’s WfH she doesn’t leave bed until 1pm, then gets stressed at the amount of work she’s given herself to do but insists her bad sleep schedule is working for her. She hates the job she is in, but says it’s too much work to find another job and the effort that goes into that. She thinks I’m a corporate sell-out, and chastises me for following a career. These conversations are all tough and difficult for me. 

I want to help her, she says constantly she is struggling but the advice I give is met with hurting her feelings. She’s been attending therapy and they’ve discussed these things, but it doesn’t seem to have made things any better. I tend to cook and do chores to try and make things easier for her,  but she’s continued to spiral. 

This is impacting other parts of her life, and I feel like I’m watching a train crash in slow motion. 

How do I be supportive in this sort of situation?

TL;DR - Partners neurodivergent symptoms are spiralling out of control, how do I be supportive without being mean?"
