Is there any research on whether doing scholarship in teaching and learning makes one a better teacher?,beerbearbare,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/10b6uch/is_there_any_research_on_whether_doing/,10,3,"I can see that \*engaging with\* others' scholarship in teaching and learning will help one become a better teacher. 

But I am curious about the relevance between actually conducting research in teaching and learning (or pedagogy) and becoming a better teacher. Is there any empirical research on this topic?"
