A little 14th century humor,illhavethecalamari,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/dwmb2/a_little_14th_century_humor/,397,1399,"From a fable by Jean de Cond√©, paraphrased from Barbara Tuchman's, A Distant Mirror.


Queen: Sir, have you fathered any children?

Knight: No my lady, I have not.

Queen: Indeed, you do not have the look of a man who could please his mistress when he held her in his arms, for your beard is little more than the kind of fuzz that ladies have in certain places.  I do not doubt your word, for it is easy to judge from the state of the hay whether the  pitchfork is any good.

Knight: Lady, answer me without deceit, is there any hair between your legs?

Queen: None at all.

Knight: Indeed I do believe you, for grass does not grow on a well-beaten path.
