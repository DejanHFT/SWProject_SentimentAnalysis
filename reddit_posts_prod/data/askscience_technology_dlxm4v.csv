"AskScience AMA Series: We're Phoenix, a Madison, Wisconsin-based (Go Badgers!) nuclear technology company. We design and build the strongest fusion neutron generators in the world - Ask us anything!",AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/dlxm4v/askscience_ama_series_were_phoenix_a_madison/,339,3404,"Hi Reddit, I'm Dr. Evan Sengbusch, President at [Phoenix, LLC](https://phoenixwi.com/). I'm here with our CEO, Dr. Ross Radel, and our VP of Research & Development, Dr. Tye Gribb, to answer whatever questions you might have about nuclear engineering, neutrons and all of their interesting uses, the current and near-term practical applications of fusion technology including our [record-breaking system for medical isotope production](https://physicsworld.com/a/record-breaking-fusion-reaction-could-transform-medical-isotope-production/), what it's like being a tech startup in Madison, and whatever else you're curious about!

At Phoenix, we've been developing our fusion technology since 2005 with the mission of applying fusion technology to solve very real near-term problems while supporting fusion research to achieve the shared, long-term dream of clean fusion energy for all. Our core innovation is extremely high output, accelerator-based Deuterium-Deuterium and Deuterium-Tritium fusion neutron generators which are strong enough to replace reactor and isotope neutron sources for applications such as [medical isotope production](https://phoenixwi.com/neutron-generators/medical-isotope-production/), [explosives detection](https://phoenixwi.com/bomb-detection/ied-detection/) and [nuclear materials detection](https://phoenixwi.com/materials-testing/radiation-hardening-survivability-testing/), [nondestructive testing](https://phoenixwi.com/neutron-radiography/), and more. 

**Evan's Bio:**
Evan holds a BS in Physics and Mathematics from the University of Iowa, as well as an MS and PhD in Medical Physics, and an MBA in Technology Management from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Evan has extensive experience with computational modeling, ion beam transport simulations, and particle accelerator design. He has also worked in the venture capital industry evaluating technologies in the physical and life sciences and has served as a consultant for several technology development firms. Evan is a past recipient of a DoD National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship, an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, and a National Institutes of Health Biotechnology Training Grant. He has technical experience working in accelerator physics at CERN, plasma physics at the University of Iowa and medical physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Since joining Phoenix in 2012, Evan has increased the variety and size of Phoenix's revenue sources and has drastically expanded Phoenix's market reach.

**Ross's Bio:**
 Ross is the CEO and a Board of Directors member of Phoenix. He holds a MS and a PhD in Nuclear Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He previously worked as the Senior Member of the Technical Staff at Sandia National Laboratories. Ross has extensive experience with nuclear reactors and advanced power conversion systems that are directly applicable to Phoenix's core technologies. His previous research at the University of Wisconsin focused on high-flux neutron generation for detecting clandestine material, specifically highly enriched uranium. Prior to taking over as President, Ross led the R&D effort to redesign the existing Phoenix ion source and neutron generator technology, leading to drastic performance increases. He is also an expert in radiation transport simulations and he has experience designing shielding, moderators, and reflectors for high-neutron environments. Ross joined Phoenix in 2010 and took over as President in July of 2011. During his tenure as President, Phoenix has increased in size by ten fold. As President, Ross has a very hands-on management style and is still intimately involved in almost all aspects of the daily technical and business operations at Phoenix.

**Tye's Bio:**
Tye has over 20 years of experience developing products for high technology companies. He was the co-founder of Imago Scientific Instruments (now part of Cameca Instruments Corporation), where he led the development of the Local Electrode Atom Probe (LEAP), Imago's flagship product, from initial sketches through commercialization. From its market introduction, this instrument has dominated the world market with sales in excess of $100M. Tye has wide-ranging design, fabrication, and scientific analysis expertise focused on the development of ion beam and other high-energy systems. He is the author of numerous papers and patents covering a wide range of technical innovations. Tye holds a PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Metallurgical Engineering. As the VP of R&D, Tye leads a talented team of technicians and engineers in both next-generation product design and, in moving prototype technologies onto commercial platforms.
