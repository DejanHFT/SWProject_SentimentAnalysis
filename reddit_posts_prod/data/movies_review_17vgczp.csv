Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' Review Thread,SanderSo47,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/17vgczp/ridley_scotts_napoleon_review_thread/,932,1617,"[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/napoleon_2023): 64% (from 42 reviews) with 6.90 in average rating

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.

> That’s a lot for any audience to digest in a single sitting, and while Scott can be commended for his ambition, neither he nor Scarpa manage to build those many plot pieces into a fluid narrative.

-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/napoleon-review-joaquin-phoenix-vanessa-kirby-ridley-scott-1235647400/)

> Those worried about a glorification of the dictator needn't have feared. You won't be prepared for the way this film utterly humiliates the one-time Emperor of France.

-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/napoleon-review-ridley-scott-joaquin-phoenix-1234926076/): B–

> Many directors have tried following Napoleon where the paths of glory lead, and maybe it is only defiant defeat that is really glorious. But Ridley Scott – the Wellington of cinema – has created an outrageously enjoyable cavalry charge of a movie, a full-tilt biopic of two and a half hours in which Scott doesn’t allow his troops to get bogged down mid-gallop in the muddy terrain of either fact or metaphysical significance, the tactical issues that have defeated other film-makers.

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/15/napoleon-review-joaquin-phoenix-emperor-ridley-scott): 5/5

> I cannot take credit for this observation, but a friend of mine who saw the movie said, “It’s like watching Tim Robinson play Napoleon,” and this is pretty dead on. Oh, make no mistake, this is by design. This is not my way of saying Napoleon is bad. It’s honestly now one of my favorite movies of the year – a movie that, before I saw it, looked a little too stoic and “important.” Instead, I probably laughed harder during this movie than I have during any new movie this year. And the laughs are genuine and intentional.

-[Mike Ryan, Uproxx](https://uproxx.com/movies/napoleon-review-ridley-scott/)

> The director’s 28th feature is a magnificent slab of dad cinema, with Phoenix a startling emperor and Vanessa Kirby brilliant as his wife.

-[Robbie Collin, The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2023/11/15/napoleon-review-ridley-scott/): 4/5

> It’s hard to imagine an actor that could pull this off and make it so engaging, but Phoenix does, an achievement made especially impressive when you realize that this self-styled master of war sent over 3 million men to their deaths in just 22 years.

-[Damon Wise, Deadline](https://deadline.com/2023/11/napoleon-review-joaquin-phoenix-vaness-kirby-in-ridley-scott-psychologically-complex-but-brilliantly-staged-biopic-1235612080/)

> Scott's take on Napoleon is distinctively deadpan: a funny, idiosyncratic close-up of the man, rather than a broader, all-encompassing account.

-[Catherine Bray, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/napoleon-2023/): 4/5

> Ridley Scott’s big-budget war epic “Napoleon” is a series of accomplished battle sequences looking for a better movie to connect them. Once again, Scott’s craftsmanship is on full display here, but it’s in service of a deeply shallow screenplay, one that hits major events in the life of its subject with too little passion or purpose, too rarely tying one to another with any sort of momentum. A phenomenal actor is reduced to a ghostly presence in the middle of the movie, and his partner, the character who needs to give the film a beating heart, comes off as two-dimensional and hollow. Again, “Napoleon” works when things go boom in undeniably impressive ways. It’s the other stuff that loses the war.

-[Brian Tallerico, RogerEbert.com](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/napoleon-movie-review-2023): 2/4

> Phoenix has always been good at depicting this kind of pathetic tyranny, deftly (and swiftly) shifting from bratty, toothless insouciance to genuine menace. The actor seems to get both the joke and the seriousness of the film, though I wish Scott were better at communicating that tone to the audience.

-[Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/11/ridley-scott-joaquin-phoenix-napoleon-review)

> Martin Scorsese is 80 and Ridley Scott is nearly 86, but neither director is showing any signs of slowing down. In recent years, in fact, their films have grown longer, more expensive and more ambitious than ever. The latest example is Napoleon, Scott's 160-minute biopic of the French military commander and ruler, which sweeps through several countries and several decades, and has several thunderous battle scenes along the way. It's an awe-inspiring achievement, although it may leave you with a greater appreciation of Scott's leadership skills than of Napoleon's.

-[Nicholas Barber, BBC](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20231114-napoleon-review-ridley-scotts-biopic-is-an-awe-inspiring-achievement): 4/5

> The feeling persists that something is missing here. That Scott and company are merely lightly touching on things that require deeper exploration. Which brings me back again to that 4-hour director's cut. Scott's director's cuts have become almost legendary — his alternate cut of ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is an almost completely different — and far superior — version than what was released in theaters. Will ""Napoleon"" be the same? We'll find out soon enough. For now, though, we can only watch what's being officially released, and wonder what could have been.

-[Chris Evangelista, Slash Film](https://www.slashfilm.com/1447068/napoleon-review/): 6/10

> Overhead shots of horizon-wide cavalry charges, cannon fire, burning ships and other wartime sights are appropriately gigantic and brutal. The Battle of Austerlitz is especially exciting. That’s all well and good, however it’s too bad Scott could not deliver a brilliant character study of one of the world’s great military leaders — and instead settled for letting a self-indulgent Phoenix fly over the cuckoo’s nest.
