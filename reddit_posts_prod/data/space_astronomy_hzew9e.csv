What astronomy book do you recommend,tony_912,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/hzew9e/what_astronomy_book_do_you_recommend/,5,6,"Recent discoveries in astronomy and space exploration progress transformed the Astronomy so much that I cannot help but feel left behind and want to brush up my knowledge on the subject.

Can you recommend a book that is up to date on solar system and gives some overview on exoplanets and rest of the news in astronomy?"
