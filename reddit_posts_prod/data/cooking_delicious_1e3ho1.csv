Any healthy and delicious grill foods?,ircmaster,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1e3ho1/any_healthy_and_delicious_grill_foods/,177,130,"So my dad and I like cooking on the grill a lot but very often it just turns out being a couple of peppers with some chicken breast and maybe fish. It's always really boring and a lot of times it's really dry. Do you guys have any good, healthy recipes that I can put on the grill where I can incorporate fish, chicken, or veggies (or even anything else you guys have in mind) and maybe cook something good for mother's day. My mom doesn't eat meat but she's fine with fish. Any ideas or recipes will be appreciated."
