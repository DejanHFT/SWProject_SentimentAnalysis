"I'm getting married to my girlfriend of 6.5 years (both F 30s). My brother [30M] insists that his new wife [25F] be a bridesmaid, though they didn't ask my GF to be one for their wedding. My otherwise-supportive family agrees that a new straight marriage trumps a long gay relationship. I feel crazy!",throwawaybrides,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2qturv/im_getting_married_to_my_girlfriend_of_65_years/,174,417,"A few months ago, the ban on same-sex marriage was lifted in my state.  On thanksgiving, my 
~~girlfriend~~ fiancee and I got engaged!!! Honestly, the only reason we didn't marry years ago was that we were legally forbidden. We've been together for 6 1/2 years, and we own a home together. My family has always been incredibly supportive. I know my parents and my GF consider each other as family. 

About two years ago, my brother [Steve, 30] met a woman [Stella, 25] on OKCupid, they hit it off and were married eighteen months later. I was a groomsmaid for my brother. They didn't ask my GF to be in their wedding party, but that didn't seem weird at the time. 


Flash forward a few months, to now. GF and I are planning our wedding and we asked some close friends (and my brother) to be in our wedding party. Over Christmas, my brother told me that he was upset that Stella wasn't asked to be my BM. I was confused, because we're not that close (S&S live in another city) and haven't known each other that long. Steve says that Stella is my sister now, and it's wrong to ""cut her out"". I did point out that GF wasn't asked to be in his wedding, and he said that was ""different"" because we ""weren't married"". He said if I didn't add Stella to my wedding party it would be causing major drama.


I got pretty upset about that. GF and I were together for years before Steve and Stella ever met. GF has been at every family gathering, holidays at home, etc. She sat in the family pew at Steve's wedding! But because we were legally banned from being married, none of that counted in Steve's eyes. 


I expressed my frustration confidentially to my parents (I know! Bad move!) and my parents sided with Steve, kind of. Dad said it was ""customary"" for siblings-in-law to be in a wedding, and that it would be rude not to add Stella. When I asked him if he ever said anything like that about GF when Steve was planning his wedding, my dad didn't really answer. Mom just asked me not to ""rock the boat"".
 
For the record, my parents are not paying for our wedding.


I'm completely surprised by all of this. I could just suck it up and add Stella as another bridesmaid, but it feels wrong to me. I don't know her very well, I don't want a huge bridal party, I feel like that would be tacitly agreeing that same-sex relationships are less valid than mixed-sex relationships, and I worry that if I give in on this, it sets a precedent for any other demands my family makes during the planning process. 

My GF is as surprised as I am by all this, but she understandably doesn't want to get involved in a debate with her in-laws. And I spent time with Stella over the holidays and she didn't mention the issue, or seem upset or put out, so I doubt she's twisting Steve's arm on this.


Should I suck it up and put Stella in my wedding to avoid conflict? How can I maneuver this situation without seeming like either a crazy bride or a furious activist?

---   
**tl;dr**: My family thinks I'm obligated to add my new SIL to my wedding, though they didn't include my long-time GF in theirs. They're treating my long-term same-sex relationship as less valid then my brother's because we couldn't get married before."
