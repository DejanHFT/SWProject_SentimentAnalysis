"Well Fittit, I'm out $500 :(",xHeiKe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/umbsd/well_fittit_im_out_500/,232,423,"but you know what? im still proud of myself.

Remember me? the guy who bet $500 he would have a six pack by june? well it's june and i have no six pack. so yeah, i just lost $500 but its all good it was worth it i guess. here's the link to the old post http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ov3lf/i_may_be_way_in_over_my_head/

Alright, well my current weight is at 189lb, i checked on an omrom electronic handheld device and my bodyfat percentage is at 14%.  As of now, i have taken it easy on the caloric deficit because im trying to bulk up now.  Im hoping to get bigger and then do another cut down to 185 and hopefully stay between 180 and 185 forever.

well here are the pics, any questions are welcome, and this is about a 4 month period... to be honest i was expecting a bit more of a difference but i got real busy with work for the last month and a half or so.
