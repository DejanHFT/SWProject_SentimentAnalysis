I need support.,Fair_Scar_8630,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10vs4oi/i_need_support/,13,4,"My (32f) ex boyfriend (41m) of three years cheated on me and i found out and ended it four days ago. I’ve moved and I’m in my own place now.

I’ve been no contact for two days. He just sent me the longest sappiest apology email. He said all the things i thought i wanted him to say. I really want to respond and talk shit and spit venom but i know it will just hurt me. And he doesn’t care, or he wouldn’t have done what he did. I get the saddest and weakest at night time.

TLDR tell me he’s a loser and i am better off not engaging."
