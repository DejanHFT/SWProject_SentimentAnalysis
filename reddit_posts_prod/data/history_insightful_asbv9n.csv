"We are experts from the PBS Nature documentary Wild Way of the Vikings, here to discuss how the wide range of wildlife encountered by the Vikings on their travels played a part in their society and culture. Ask Us Anything!",WildVikingExperts,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/asbv9n/we_are_experts_from_the_pbs_nature_documentary/,230,3616,"As the Vikings crossed the North Atlantic around 1000 AD, they encountered a wide range of diverse wildlife. Arctic foxes, gyrfalcons, reindeer, otters, ravens, humpback whales, gannets, and much more - each creature played a part in their society and culture, with some even ending up as figures in Norse mythology. The Vikings had a deep respect for the land and sea, as it served as their compass and guide.
