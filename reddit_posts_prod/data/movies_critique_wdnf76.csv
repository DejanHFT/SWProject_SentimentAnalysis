What film or TV show handled Time Travel the best?,TheSilentSlothMan,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/wdnf76/what_film_or_tv_show_handled_time_travel_the_best/,279,67,"Time Travel can sometimes be frustrating in media. It often becomes easy to critique, leads to plot holes and other nonsense. It can often be grossly mishandled or relied on too heavily to explain away bad writing.

That said, some shows and films have done it well.

So what's your 'best handled' time travel show or film, and why?"
