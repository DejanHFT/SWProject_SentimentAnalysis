Exercise your creativity and art skills with Challenges,CarlosCarvalho84,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/cfytf0/exercise_your_creativity_and_art_skills_with/,0,4," Hello, I created this app called Jam that has some art challenges every 2 days (photo,writing,drawing) where you can exercise your creativity and share with other people.

The app and the challenges are totaly free and I think that it is a good resource for those who like to make art and see art.

I'm thinking of adding some prizes to the winner in the future but for this I need people to join the project... The first challenge will be on 10 July and I hope you like...
