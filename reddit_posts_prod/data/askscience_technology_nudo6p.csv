"If communication and travel between Earth, the Moon, and Mars (using current day technology) was as doable as it is to do today between continents, would the varying gravitational forces cause enough time dilation to be noticeable by people in some situations?",PartTimeSassyPants,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/nudo6p/if_communication_and_travel_between_earth_the/,253,2592,"I imagine the constantly shifting distances between the three would already make things tricky enough, but I'm having trouble wrapping my head around how a varying ""speed of time"" might play a factor.  I'd imagine the medium and long-term effects would be greater, assuming the differences in gravitational forces are even significant enough for anyone to notice. 

 I hope my question makes sense, and apologies if it doesn't... I'm obviously no expert on the subject!  
Thanks!  :)"
