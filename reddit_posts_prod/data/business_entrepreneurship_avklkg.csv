Can I pursue business and entrepreneurship with a different degree?,3kdono,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/avklkg/can_i_pursue_business_and_entrepreneurship_with_a/,6,2,"Hey guys! As the title states, I want to pursue business and entrepreneurship, I want to start a business 5-10 years from now. 

I am a recent graduate in the field of BS Information Systems and Iâ€™ve just been on the computer my whole life. I have decided to pursue business and entrepreneurship because it excites me. 

I know I kinda chose the wrong degree but I wanted to ask for advices in what to do? Do I have to go back to school? What type of entry level jobs are best to prepare me for my own small business in the future? Will self-study with online materials and books be enough? 

Any suggestions or advices would be highly appreciated. Thank you!!
