My (24F) ‘friend’ (28f) is accusing me of supporting the Paris bombing and of being an IS supporter because I couldn’t pitch in for donations to a Paris school.,throwexplosions,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ss7n0/my_24f_friend_28f_is_accusing_me_of_supporting/,122,461,"Edit about my username: I meant ""throwaway explosions"" not ""throw explosions"" as in ""throws explosions"". Needed to make that clear. 


EDIT: sorry I forgot to put durations. I have been in since programme for 3 years and I have been friends with both X and Y for 2.5. 


This is a throway. 


**Background**


I (24F) am a Lebanese finishing her masters studies in Europe. I do some part time jobs (mainly pet sitting) to save money for extra stuff and for saving in symbolic (there’s not much there) account. On Thursday, there was a twin bombing in my hometown, where my family’s house was partially damaged. I am very shaken up and am struggling to finish my thesis as I have a deadline, but will probably not make it on time for graduation by the end of the year anyway. I sent some money yesterday morning to my mother, just to help her out for emergencies. The money is so symbolic but I did it anyway because she is my mother and it could help her in this time of need.


**The issue**


Today, I got a call from my classmate X (28F) (in the same program as myself) who is collecting donations to be sent to a Paris via her friend who is leaving back to Paris on Tuesday. I trust(ed) this classmate and I consider (considered?) her a friend. I told her I wish I could help but I am very sorry because I won’t be able to. She said it was ok and then that was it. Two hours later after her call, I got a message on facebook from another classmate Y (24F) telling me that classmate X told her I refused to give money because ’I was happy about the bombing in Paris’. Classmate Y did not believe I said that and called her bullshit, and directly told me about it. It turns out that classmate X is spreading rumours about me on fb and via text messages about me being an IS supporter because ‘why else would I refuse to give money?’. The ‘I am an IS supporter’ part was messaged by X to Y and other classmates, and two classmates told me about the message.  


I called X to confront her (maybe that was a stupid idea) and told her why is she saying those things about me and explained to her I am short on cash, and I sent my mom some money after the Beirut bombing and that my mom’s house is damaged. She told me I am doing that for attention, there was no Beirut bombing (‘because I [X] didn’t hear about it on the news’), that I should feel ashamed for not helping France out and that I am disgusting for mourning ‘a fictive’ bombing while a ‘real’ one happened in Paris. I told her that IS did BOTH the Beirut AND Paris bombing so what was she on about!? She told me she will ‘report’ my ‘suspicious’ refusal (what the hell) to the administration of the Uni. I was so shocked I had no idea what to do and was on the verge of tears, by the end of the call.
I have no idea what to do. I am already stricken with grieve and am very upset about what happened to my country and my mom and family. I don’t know if I should take what she’s saying seriously or should I just let it go? I didn’t mean any harm to be honest and in retrospect I wish I just donated some money (even though that would mean not getting by at the end of the month). I have no idea what to do. Any advice?


TL;DR: My ‘friend’ (28f) is accusing me of supporting the Paris bombing and of being an IS supporter because I couldn’t pitch in for donations to a Paris school.
