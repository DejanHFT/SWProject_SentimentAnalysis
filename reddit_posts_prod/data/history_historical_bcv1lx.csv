The historical figure you are the most interested by ?,RicardoKO,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/bcv1lx/the_historical_figure_you_are_the_most_interested/,95,21,"Hello guys ! I wanted to make this thread to see who are the historical figures that people like the most.

It can be because of what he accomplished, his personnality, etc... 

It can be also a role model !

As the thread maker I will start by saying who I like the most.

In fact, since my childhood, I've been a fan of the famous Julius Caesar, I don't really know why, for me he may represent the ultimate accomplishment (this man could do anything, like he was litteraly bad at nothing), even though there was Alexander the great before him, I have always put Caesar above him as the greatest figure who walked the earth.

And you guys ?"
