Wrote a little something yesterday concerning the human race and the narcissistic effects of living in the 21st century.,LetsGetMystical,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1marcw/wrote_a_little_something_yesterday_concerning_the/,4,0,"The rise of technology has awakened the long dormant power of self-absorbed human potential where an age of selfies and statuses reign supreme. Where the opinions of others triumph over our personal self-reflections. Where everything is a race, an underlying competition, a tug-of-war of attention whores. Jealousy stemming from pixels on a computer screen, malicious gossip filling the air with the foul stench of placid complacency. Slaves to our own passions. Durkheim was right, yet he could have never predicted that it would grow to such an insurmountable scale.

No one is satisfied, the thirst never quite quenched, like parched lips tasting drops of sea water, a facade of fulfillment,
leaving the user worse than before. We believe that we have so much figured out. Yet with such power at our fingertips, it is that much easier
to concentrate on one's self.

Ruled by devices of our own design, buying into the 21st century idealistic view of what the future is and what it should be. How the power excites
us as we demand more, frothing from our quivering lips in anticipation like a pack of wild dogs awaiting their turn to devour the carcass.

I'm sure that others see it, though they are a minority. These are trying times, unlike any before us. I fear that our power will run rampant, destroying the world around us before we dare question our actions.

When will it be too late? What will it take? Even if we reach the breaking point, will we be able to recover from our losses?
Or will we end up to be the bastard generation of the human race?

First to see a real technological surge, first to succumb to its power.

What is in store for future generations? The trend is far from slowing.

Younger and younger, buying into the same scheme with ignorant, childhood bliss, blind to the destructive nature that an uninhibited obsession with technology can have on one's mind.

And when we are older, as we cling to our precious gadgets and the misleading wisdom contained within, do we pass on these ideals to our youth?
Will it get even worse? Well, it certainly won't magically become better.

So when will the turning point occur?

In order to break this downward spiral of vapid narcissism, there must be some sort of revolution. A revolution of the self.

A look inward, a contemplation of our vile practices, an acceptance of what is, a knowing of what should be, a practice of moderation, and a desire to change. Looking at the grand scale, no longer using our restricted, self-absorbed view where the world revolves around how successful our social networking posts are.

Seeing the human condition for what it is and having the courage to say ""this is wrong"", stomping out our negative practices before they evolve into demons which dictate every moment of our waking lives. A state of constant worrying, constant requests for the approval of others, and futile attempts to fill a void with a shape that refuses to fit.

We know where we stand now, we just need to imagine where we will end up. In the end, we need to look inward and question our own practices, be accepting to change, and knowing that this is for the good of us all."
