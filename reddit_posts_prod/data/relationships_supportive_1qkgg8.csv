Me [27F] with boyfriend [28m] of a year: How do I be supportive of his hobbies without lying?,tryingtobsupportive,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qkgg8/me_27f_with_boyfriend_28m_of_a_year_how_do_i_be/,53,44,"My boyfriend and I have been together for just over a year now and just moved in with each other. Our relationship is great but moving in together has definitely been a big change. We both have our own hobbies and one of his happens to be playing guitar/singing. 


Since moving in together, he's been showing me more and more of the songs he's been working on. I don't like most them, but I haven't told him this. I've been trying to only focus on positive things that I can say about his songs and have not said anything negative thus far. Examples: I like the guitar in that part, that's a really creative story, etc etc. 


Honestly though, I don't like his songs. I don't enjoy theatrical songs, and I think his songs are a bit creepy/depressing. He keeps sharing these songs with me, and I feel like I'm walking a very thin line between trying to be neutral (by only pointing out specific things I do like) and having to tell a white lie so that I don't hurt his feelings. I can objectively say that he is a talented singer, but all his songs are in the same key and it's starting to get irritating that he wants my input. I'm of the belief that if you don't have something nice to say, you shouldn't say it. But I feel like I'm being backed into a corner whenever he asks me my opinion. It probably doesn't help that we have completely different tastes in music, and I would never listen to the kind of music he listens to/makes on my own.

Soooo, help! How can I be still be a supportive of him without saying something I'm uncomfortable with or lying?

**tl;dr**: My boyfriend likes to share music he writes with me. I rarely enjoy the music he makes. How do I be supportive of this hobby without lying about whether or not I think his music is good?"
