Can anyone give me any insight into the Greek city-states of antiquity?,NoMoreNicksLeft,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/i997d/can_anyone_give_me_any_insight_into_the_greek/,28,47,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polis

I'm curious as to how these political entities would compare to the modern idea of nation-states. Ignoring the anachronistic aspect of such a question, were any of these city-states to exist today would they be seated at the UN? Were any of them more properly just petty kingdoms with minimal territory?

For that matter, does anyone even know of a list of them that is comprehensive but without cruft? Wikipedia's own list includes quite a few that don't seem to be city-states proper, but merely colonies or suburbs of the genuine ones.

In short, I'm looking for indicators (or the lack there of) that would put them on par with modern national entities. Some certainly struck their own coinage, most had absolute authority vested locally/domestically to make laws within their own borders. They had their own militaries. Things of this nature.

[edit] I'd like to thank all of you for your replies. I do now have more insight into them. For those interested, this is what I'm working on:

It seems clear that the poleis should be included in such a list. I'll start working on that shortly."
