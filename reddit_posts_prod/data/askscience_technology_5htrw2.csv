Does storage technology have an upper limit?,CaptainVonDanDan,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5htrw2/does_storage_technology_have_an_upper_limit/,8,7,"It used to be that a hard drive the size of a refrigerator had storage capacity measured in megabytes. These days, you can get a usb flash drive with a terabyte in storage. Will this upward trend continue? Will there be things like petabyte hard drives in the not-too-distant future? Or is there an upper limit to increases in storage capacity?"
