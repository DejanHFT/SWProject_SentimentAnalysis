My (24f) SO (33m) isn't being supportive as I deal with the death of my 11 year old friend(11f).,Yellowyellow123,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54b57g/my_24f_so_33m_isnt_being_supportive_as_i_deal/,83,158,"Okay Reddit, someone tell me something because I'm ready to end things with my boyfriend and find someone who cares about me and my needs (in the same way I care about his). 

Last week, my friend passed away. She was 11 and it's hard because 1. She was my friend. I loved her. 2. She was 11. Death of children is heartbreaking and I'm hardly wrapping my brain around her not being here to grow into the beautiful bright woman who had the spirit and leadership to create real change.

Anyway. To the issue at hand. I've called my boyfriend several times to cry and whine and moan about how sad I am. He's been more than willing to listen. 

However, he has not called or texted to check up on me once since I found out. I specifically told him how this made me feel and FLAT OUT ASKED HIM to text and check in on me, something I personally don't feel like I should have to ask. 

Anyway. He didn't do it. His reasoning? Apparently, I know how he is, he doesn't do phones, he's thought about me and my grief and he's being there for me by always being willing to listen. 

It's not caused a few fights and I can't wrap my brain around it. He's awful at communication but this seems to be too far. It takes 7 seconds to say 

""Hello, how are you?"" Via text and he just refuses. 

I feel abandoned and unimportant. I'm disgusted by him. 

Am I being unreasonable? Is him being willing to listen enough? Can we recover from this or is this worth leaving him over? 

Tl;dr: my boyfriend refuses to text and see how I'm doing while I'm grieving the loss of my young friend. 

Edit: a lot of people are concerned about my   11 yo friend. I work in disadvantaged communities. I spent time with her family and friends. She was like a little sister to me. "
