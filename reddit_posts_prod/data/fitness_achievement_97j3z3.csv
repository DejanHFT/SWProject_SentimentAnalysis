Struggling to achieve hypertrophy at the gym whilst training for sport.,Thranrond,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/97j3z3/struggling_to_achieve_hypertrophy_at_the_gym/,7,0,"I (20M) have started training for badminton again recently. This currently entails on court training 2 times a week, running at a track 2-3 times a week and competitions weekly or so.

I've been going to the gym for about 2.5 years now with hypertrophy always being my main goal. I've made some great progress but in the last few weeks I'm really struggling to achieve these two very different goals: hypertrophy and endurance for sport.

I'm trying to follow a 4 day program (PHUL) but it seems too physically demanding. I have shin splints, I've started to get forearm splints, my wrist hurts a lot and my quad muscles hurt from being overworked.

I don't know how to balance these two but I don't want to stop badminton or stop growing muscle (currently on a leak bulk). Do I have sacrifice one goal over the other? Is this mostly a mental issue?

Should I drop the weight at the gym and slowly build up?"
