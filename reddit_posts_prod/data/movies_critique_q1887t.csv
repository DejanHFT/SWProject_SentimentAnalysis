Edward Scissorhands is a critique of the internal and external appearances of society,Anon-Ymous929,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/q1887t/edward_scissorhands_is_a_critique_of_the_internal/,5,38,"It's October now and I just watched Edward Scissorhands. I haven't seen it since I was a kid. It came out when I was very young, and thinking back on it, why the heck did my parents let me watch this thing as a young kid? Anyways.

A common theme in Tim Burton movies is stories that look aesthetically just like a horror movie, but you don't get scared the way most horror movies scare you because the story is being told from the point of view of the scary thing. Beetlejuice is told from the point of view of the ghosts themselves who are haunting their old house. Sweeney Todd is told from the point of view of the serial killer. But what makes Edward Scissorhands particularly interesting is how Tim Burton uses this point of view to compare a terrifying monster with scissors for hands who actually doesn't mean to do any harm to anyone vs. a happy looking suburban town full of secretly terrible people.

The first time you see Edward is when Peg, an Avon representative, has wandered up the spooky hill into his spooky mansion, and Edward is just a silhouette with blades for hands in the corner of an upstairs room. He seems exactly like the type of dangerous monster you wouldn't want to run into in any other movie, but Peg seems completely oblivious to the apparent danger and instead invites Edward to her home where she dresses him, feeds him dinner, and scolds her son for not being nice to him. This whole time we see Edward being surprisingly careful with his hands. He does very little damage with them, accidentally cutting his own face once or twice, and Peg tries using her Avon products to help with his scars and such. For the first act of the movie he seems unoffended by the townspeople's stupid jokes or various reactions, he's just trying to be helpful. He cuts everyone's hedges and starts grooming their dogs and even cutting their hair. He goes pretty much wherever people tell him to go, and wouldn't hurt anyone on purpose.

Compare that against the townspeople. Their houses and cars are all bright pastel colors. They smile and wave at each other as they drive down the street and see kids playing or people mowing their lawns. It looks just like an exaggerated version of a 60s sitcom full of happy people, but despite the appearance you also see how terrible they are. One of the women tries to get her repairman to have an affair with her. This same woman later on tries to seduce Edward, and when he doesn't react as she expects she tells the other women that Edward attempted to rape her. The women gossip, the teenage daughter, Kim, has a jerk for a boyfriend who tries to use Edward to help him break into his father's house to steal things. Edward ends up getting arrested but still refuses to rat anyone out because of the affection he feels for Kim. He takes out his frustration by damaging some curtains and wallpaper, which the townspeople take as proof that he's been dangerous all along. He saves Kim's younger brother from being hit by a car, and the townspeople mistake this as Edward attacking the boy.

In the final act Edward goes on a bit of a rampage, tearing off the clothes Peg gave him, cutting the leg off one of his hedge sculptures, and stabbing a car tire. But not actually hurting anyone. Every time he has hurt someone it has been on accident, and every time he has caused damage on purpose it has been out of frustration for the contradictory aspects of society. He wasn't trying to steal anything, but he was the only one who got arrested for it. The townspeople were nice to him at first, but they quickly turn on him because of confirmation bias when they see him getting in trouble. He likes Kim, but she puts up with a jerk for a boyfriend who doesn't treat her well.

Also I don't know why but there are like 3 different people in the movie who say something to Edward like ""I know a doctor who might be able to help you with that"", but this never actually goes anywhere. So clearly you're supposed to notice this lack of resolution, but I don't know exactly how to interpret it.

I won't spoil the ending, but yeah my main takeaway from the movie is the juxtaposition between Edward, who is terrifying on the outside but innocent on the inside, vs. the townspeople who appear innocent on the outside but are corrupted, fickle, and selfish on the inside."
