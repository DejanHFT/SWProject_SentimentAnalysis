Good movies that fall apart at the very end,Ill-Assistance6711,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18twsts/good_movies_that_fall_apart_at_the_very_end/,1119,774,"What are some examples of movies you’ve seen that you are think are very good, until the last few minutes?

First thing that comes to my mind is Lars Von Trier’s “Nymphomaniac.” 

SPOILERS

Despite the dark themes and brutal content, the story manages to wrap up in a surprisingly warm and heartfelt way with Charlotte Gainsbourg’s character finding the one man in the world she can truly call a friend—an asexual, intellectual virgin with a strong moral compass and only an academic interest in sex…who, out of nowhere, tries to rape her in the films final two minutes only to be shot and killed. The End.

I love a dark ending, I love a depressing, unhappy ending. And I almost never use “it just felt like X for X’s sake” as a critique, but this is a rare exception. It really did feel like it was dreary just for the sake of being dreary. 

A cheap ending to what was up to that point a pretty solid film.  

What are your examples?"
