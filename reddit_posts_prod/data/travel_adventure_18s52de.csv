Adventures as a hostel night manager,Capitan_Scythe,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18s52de/adventures_as_a_hostel_night_manager/,11,73,"A few years ago (more than I'd care to admit) I had the pleasure of working as a hostel night manager in Brisbane for about 3 months. It came about by accident, needing to help a friend cover medical bills while the insurance payout came through. I won't name the place but anyone who has been there will likely recognise it from different 'unique' features.   


My shifts were 8pm until 5am 3 days on, 3 off. The hostel was located within a short walk of the Suncorp Stadium and had its own bar, so we got a lot of walk-ins that weren't guests. It also meant I filled double duty as bar security.   


For anyone not familiar with Queensland's licensing laws, you cannot bring alcohol onto licensed premises. It was hammered into us that they are pretty strict with the fines for staff members who were involved, plus licence holders and landowners. Never saw anyone get a fine, but neither did I fancy taking that risk seeing as I was trying to earn enough to carry on with the next stage of my trip.

On one occasion, I was working bar security when the bar owner asked me to help him escort out two drunk idiots who had trashed the mens toilet (ripped a soap dispenser off the wall and stuffed it into the toilet, that kind of thing). They kicked up a fuss but they were properly shitfaced and we weren't so it was easy to doge the punches. After they'd been sent off, the owner asked if I could go find their mate and just let him know what had happened. Not a problem, off I trot. Their mate just happened to be the proverbial brick outhouse. For context, I'm 6ft/1.83cm and I had to look up at him. His biceps were the size of my thighs. However, he was sitting peacefully drinking from a big jug of beer like it was a pint glass. 

After explaining what had happened, he sighed and made to follow his mates, before turning to me and asking if I could kick him out too. He said he'd never been kicked out of a bar before (Not that I was surprised) and wanted to do the whole kicking/screaming while being forcefully ejected. Took both my arms and holding them up at face height for me to get the proper leverage on a half nelson, and even then it was a struggle to push him along. The whole bar goes silent and just stares as we pass through. Once we were out of sight, he chuckled and released himself from my grip, shook my hand and strolled off into the night. Coincidentally, I never had any more problems with drunks acting up after that.

Another evening I got a call to head down to the 'dungeon' to deal with an unruly guy, a 21-bed mixed-dorm room that was only 21AUD per night. It was underground with no windows and smelt just like you'd imagined. Privacy was not really a thing unless you got lucky and scored a corner bunk and some extra bed sheets to make yourself a screen. This guy had neither of those and yet was happily having a wank on top of his bottom bunk, above the bed covers, around 8pm. He continued to enjoy himself even while talking to me as I told him to stop. The only thing that stopped him in the end was getting a cup of water and flicking droplets in his face. He slunk off to the bathrooms and promised to not do it again.

One night I was chilling in the back room watching the cameras and eating some cold dinner while waiting for the local clubs to close and the drunks to return home. There were some camera blindspots throughout the building, some where you'd expect (toilets/showers/etc) and some where you wouldn't (laundry room). The laundry room was kinda an open secret but was normally heavily trafficked so not the sort of place to go enjoy a private moment. Except at  this time it seemed as one couple make their way down to the laundry room, giggling and kissing the whole way. I went to turn the screen away as voyeurism is not a kink of mine, until they took a bottle of rum from out a bag. The owners review the camera footage each day, so I had no choice but to go down and confiscate the bottle. Loudly stomping down the stairs and acting like I was in some shitty pantomime, ""Now it is time to check the laundry room. I wonder if there is anyone in there? I better go check."" Turns out I was being too subtle about my intentions and caught the couple fucking atop the dryer with bottle in hand. They didn't hear me when I stood there and asked for the bottle either. Taking it out of their hand sure made them jump though. Left them to enjoy the rest of their evening, although they checked out early the next morning and didn't ask for their rum bottle back. Wonder why..

There were more times than I can remember watching drunk people doing stupid stuff. If it was harmless, I left them alone. The most memorable was one guy who had got himself a cone of chips on his way back and decided he needed ketchup. Rather than take the indoor stairs which were unlocked, he decided the best way would be to go past the swimming pool and across the patio to the outside kitchen doors. For safety reasons, Australia has a law that states all swimming pools must have a barrier around them that children cannot get over. In this case, it was a series of glass panels about adult chest height with some glass paneled gates. 

This intrepid hero manages to climb over the glass on his fifth attempt, falling over on the far side but keeping his chips unspilled and himself out of the pool. The next glass barrier proved too much for him and despite almost thirty minutes of trying to get over, he eventually gave up and sat by the pool enjoying his (presumably) cold chips. The look of despair almost brought a tear to my eye (if I hadn't already been crying with laughter) as I had walked out to meet him by this point and just opened the unlocked gate.

It was an oddly fun experience. Some nights I was the poacher, some nights the game-keeper. Made a lot of friends there though. Would never stay in the 21-bed dorm again though.
