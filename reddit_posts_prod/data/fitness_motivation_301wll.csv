Keeping Motivated - How do you keep motivated?,NightKnight95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/301wll/keeping_motivated_how_do_you_keep_motivated/,11,1,"Evening/Afternoon/Morning all,

I'm wondering how each of you keep motivated to keep fit. That goes for people looking to gain muscle, wanting to run timed marathons - everyone. 

I was incredibly motivated in the new year to start lifting and get into shape. I've made quite a bit of progress but it is hard for me to find time to work out with exams coming up and I'm finding it difficult to get motivated when I do have time. 

As an exaggerated example, I may think: 'there's no point because I will have lost what I have gained today because I can't work out again for another few days'.

Hearing how you guys motivate yourselves may help me. Whether its pictures, quotes, videos or just some straight advice is all good.

Peace <3"
