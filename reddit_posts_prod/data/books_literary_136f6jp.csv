I was stuck in a rut of reading classic novels because, let's face it, they're safe and reliable. But I wanted to explore different genres and contemporary authors, to figure out what all the fuss was about.

First up was sci-fi, and I gotta say, J.G. Ballard's ""Vermilion Sands"" rocked my world.

Next, I tried to get into romance novels, but it was tough to find one that really did it for me. I sorta cheated and went with Jane Austen's ""Mansfield Park,"" which I gotta admit is a damn masterpiece.

Then I gave fantasy a shot, but the Discworld series just seemed kinda silly to me. It was the best I could find, though.

I also decided to dive into African literature. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's ""Americanah"" was, in my opinion, a preachy mess with cardboard characters. But Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o's ""A Grain of Wheat"" blew me away. What an amazing little book.

And finally, I explored Asian literature with Dazai's ""No Longer Human."" It was a wild and unsettling ride, but strangely alluring.

That's where I'm at so far this year. Next up, I'm gonna try some non-fiction books and poetry. Gotta keep mixing it up, ya know?"
