How far is AI in computer games?,dpoakaspine,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/116z2b/how_far_is_ai_in_computer_games/,15,1,"Today I saw a trailer of the new Hitman game and some developer noted ""hunt mode"" where NPCs would hunt you down. I am also interested in military sims like ARMA2+3 etc... and I was wondering: 

How far is AI in computer games related to group behaviour? Are they just imitating some rules of the group of choice or are they using AI patterns or something like that? How much effort is put in this or is it only small part of a (complex) game?

I know this is a vague question. I couldn't grasp it any other way.



edit: a word"
