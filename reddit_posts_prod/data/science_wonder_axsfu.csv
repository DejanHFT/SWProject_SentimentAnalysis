Does anyone else wonder if we could ever actually live on another planet?,TheKarmaModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/axsfu/does_anyone_else_wonder_if_we_could_ever_actually/,20,3,"From what I've learned about what humans require to live successfully on earth, it seems to me that we'd never be able to leave our 'bubbles' in establishments on other planets. I suppose since there are so many planets out there, there'll be a few  that fall within our parameters.

Whats r/science/'s thoughts on this?"
