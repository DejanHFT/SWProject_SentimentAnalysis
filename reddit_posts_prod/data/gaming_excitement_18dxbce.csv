Are there any upcoming Open World games you are waiting for in excitement?,OctoHead369,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/18dxbce/are_there_any_upcoming_open_world_games_you_are/,17,0,"Because there is a couple that I am waiting for. The ones that I just can't wait for are:

**[Palworld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/)** - I know, I know... there might be nothing to be waiting for. This game might never come out and even if it does it might be a total flop. But I just can't help myself. What I've already seen from this game looks absolutely incredible and it has everything I could possibly ask for: Pokemons, guns, survival mechanics, flying mounts and a graphics style that is very appealing to me. 

**[STALKER 2: Hear of Chernobyl](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/)** - I've never played the first game, but from what I've seen it reminded me a lot of Fallout 3 and Metro 2033, and if there is a chance for a game that takes everything what was good about those two, mixes it together and adds a spoonful of modern graphics, I couldn't be more excited. 

**[Tchia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1496590/Tchia/)** - A beautiful, hand-designed, colorful and cozy world through which you can sail, glide and slide, with chill gameplay and comforting, tropical vibe? Sounds like a no-brainer to me. 

**[Dragon's Dogma 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2054970/Dragons_Dogma_2/)** -  I've played the first one through a couple times and loved every single minute of it. This one is supposed to have even more content and Shadow of the Colossus-like boss fights. How could anyone not want to see that?

**[Light No Fire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719590/Light_No_Fire/)** - Is Hello Games going to be able to make it come true? I have no idea. But the trailer left me speechless during today's Game Awards. This game looks beautiful and I my dream now is to see it become reality.
