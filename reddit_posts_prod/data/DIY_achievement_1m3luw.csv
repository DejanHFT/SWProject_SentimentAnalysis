Trying to achieve glass like finish with varnish on a coffee table,shahadar,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1m3luw/trying_to_achieve_glass_like_finish_with_varnish/,9,4,"Hi DIY! I've searched the Googles and /r/DIY but haven't been able to get anything conclusive. I've printed a map on A2 adhesive paper and stuck it on to an old coffee table (inspired by an earlier post). I now want to varnish it to high gloss. I don't get much choice of materials where I live, so all I can use as a varnish is a polyurethane clear coat. What is the best way to get a great, thick, glossy finish? I've read that you varnish, fine sand, dust, repeat. Final layer don't sand. Others have suggested rubbing the final layer with steel wool, then buffing, then using a wax and buffing again. The best wax I can get is probably turtle car was with carnauba.

Any suggestions on how to get it right would be highly appreciated! I'm gifting this to someone, the table probably won't ever get used for drinks, most likely for books.
