Gym subscription 4 months...What Can I achieve.,Chidori18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/347czj/gym_subscription_4_monthswhat_can_i_achieve/,11,0,"So..I am going a the Gym for about 1 month and some days  now and I am wondering,how fit can I become in the timespan I have left..Up 'till now , The only difference I am seeing is that I have gained a good ammount of muscle tissue in my biceps due to lifting(I suppose) but my chest area and belly are sorta too difficult to see results...I have a pretty small belly but I want it to be flat by the start of july...Same for my(skinyfat build) sligh manboobs that are the cause  of the depresson of my early years,they are slightly firmer..but not much.
What could I do to achieve a flat stomach in that sort of a timespan..without actually losing muscle tissue or anything..
How much canI achive with the rest of my time there.."
