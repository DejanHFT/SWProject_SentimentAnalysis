What do you consider to be the best ‘action sequence’ in cinema history?,Visible-Doughnut-782,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/rpcbsh/what_do_you_consider_to_be_the_best_action/,2356,1667,"I appreciate that ‘action sequence’ is a very broad term. This might mean a 1 on 1 fight scene, a massive war battle, a car chase, a gun fight, a foot chase, an energetic dance sequence, an intergalactic dust up….whatever ‘action sequence’ means to you and whatever you personally find important about it’s execution. Maybe it’s the choreography. Maybe it’s the cinematography. Maybe it’s stakes within the context of the film. 

There are so many to choose from as in many way the ‘action sequence’ is the purest expression of cinema. It’s why ‘action’ films arguably cross cultural divides more than any genre of cinema.

Far from being a great film overall but my personal favourite isolated ‘action sequence’ is the one shot Tony Jaa staircase fight scene from The Protector. How nobody( that we know of) died achieving it is a miracle."
