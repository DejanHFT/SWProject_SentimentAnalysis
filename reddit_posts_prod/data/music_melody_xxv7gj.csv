The Loneliest - Måneskin: Heard Melody before,AleAchilles,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/xxv7gj/the_loneliest_måneskin_heard_melody_before/,4,2,"Hi,

I feel like I know the melody but I can't place it. Can anybody help? Was this used before?

Especially the start of the chorus and verse 1.

Would be insane if anybody knows the ""original"". Not really a copy as it only is the one melody."
