"Jogged last night for the first time...well, ever.",JethroByte,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1o54yj/jogged_last_night_for_the_first_timewell_ever/,202,645,"Ok, I'm sure I've jogged before, but this time was for exercise.  My wife and I went out for our usual late night walk before bed, and I threw down the challenge to run from one street lamp to the next (about 200 ft) She was down for it, so we did it.  After a short walk, we did it again.  Then again.  

It was an odd feeling actually making my 215lb frame move that fast for no reason other than I could.  My wife was having issues keeping up, which I felt bad for.  She's in the 150s, shorter than me, and I think she has less cardio ability than I do because she was breathing pretty hard at the end of the third jog and I was pretty much okay.  She could still talk alright but she was puffin pretty hard and was kinda phlegmy.  

We've decided to do the same again more often.  Hopefully this matures into being able to actually job the whole distance around the neighborhood!"
