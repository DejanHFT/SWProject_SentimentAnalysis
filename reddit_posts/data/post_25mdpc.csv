"[Serious] Reddit, what's on your Bucket List and how can we help cross some of those things off?",megangigilyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/25mdpc/serious_reddit_whats_on_your_bucket_list_and_how/,6231,1909,"I figure there are enough people on Reddit so we could help some people cross some things off their bucket list, if it's offering a place to stay while they travel the country, great! If it's knowing a children's book publisher and getting them to look at someone's book, great! Even if it's as simple as making a friend from another country, great.

Let's help each other cross some things off our bucket lists!

Edit: I just wanted to let you guys know that this has been amazing! You all are so interesting and have so many wonderful goals! This thread really shows how the internet can help people and bring them together. Thanks you guys :]
