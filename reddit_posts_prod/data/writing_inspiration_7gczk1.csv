What's Your Biggest Inspiration?,Audric_Sage,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/7gczk1/whats_your_biggest_inspiration/,166,87,"Thought I'd introduce a more or less casual conversation prompt.

For the longest time my biggest inspiration has been Dune, I don't know why, I was never the biggest fan of the book's story, but Frank Herbert's way of pulling a world together and making it feel real is astonishing, so much painstaking detail is placed into it.

Recently I started listening to the soundtrack of the Witcher 3 again and it brought back waves of nostalgia for a game that isn't even that old. Maybe I'm just in love with world building, I thought the narrative was good but the world itself was simply phenomenal. Ever since I started listening to the soundtrack I've been more excited than ever to get back into writing again."
