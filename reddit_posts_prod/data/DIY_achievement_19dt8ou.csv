Sump Installation,xenidus,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/19dt8ou,4,1,"Took the day to rectify a persistent flooding problem when it would rain for more than 3 hours. Bought the house last winter then had a relatively dry year until this past month so it was never an issue.


Materials cost was $570 including the breaker hammer rental. With the help of my boss it took us just under 6 hours. Totally an achievable task for a typical homeowner. Plumbing is a bit more technical but also something you can easily YouTube."
