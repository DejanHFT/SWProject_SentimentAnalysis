How to achieve all of my fitness goals?,tlfranklin76,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3l3av7/how_to_achieve_all_of_my_fitness_goals/,15,3,"So I am in the worst shape of my life.  I want to get loose weight fit.  To me fitness is a combination of strength, conditioning, and flexibility.  

**Strength**

I am in the third week of SL 5x5 and am really enjoying it and want to continue.  

**Conditioning**

I have been doing steady-state cardio on the rowing machine for 15-20 minutes after my workouts.  

**Flexability**

I haven't been doing anything as far as flexibility is concerned.  

**Diet**

I have also been monitoring my diet with myfitnesspal/TDEE2.0 spreadsheet and have seen great results with weightloss.  My questions mainly stem from a total fitness standpoint. 

I know that I would like to keep the three aspects in this order and that I want to stick with SL 5x5 because I'm enjoying it and making progress.  For flexibility, I am going to add *Starting Stretching* to the end of my workouts.  But for conditioning, should I change to HIIT or keep steady state?  Which is better for overall conditioning without hurting my progress in SL5x5?"
