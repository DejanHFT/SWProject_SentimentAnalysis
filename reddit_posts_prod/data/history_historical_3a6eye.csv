Best Named Historical Event,HistoricalNazi,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3a6eye/best_named_historical_event/,93,28,"I just began reading the historical fiction novel The Pillar of the Earth by Ken Follett.  I began going on Wikipedia to read more about the time in which the novel is set and found that the events of the book are placed during a time in English history called [""The Anarchy""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anarchy).  For some reason I thought that this name was really cool.  

What are some other interestingly named historical events?  The historical importance of the event has no bearing on how cool or interesting the name for it can be. "
