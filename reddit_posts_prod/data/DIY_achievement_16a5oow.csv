Questions about re-doing a tv/fireplace wall unit,jer148,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/16a5oow/questions_about_redoing_a_tvfireplace_wall_unit/,0,1,"Currently: [https://imgur.com/a/vEHVC1z](https://imgur.com/a/vEHVC1z) 

Would like to achieve: [https://imgur.com/a/P9ZCSt4](https://imgur.com/a/P9ZCSt4)

We aren't fans of the huge cavity behind the TV and would take the opportunity to change the entire look. I don't really want to mess with the ceiling so I believe I need to demo from the top of the cavity down by removing the drywall, the mantle, and the tiles. I would add framing in cavity and move the electrical forward.

What typically goes around the fireplace? I'm guessing I can't use drywall. 

Any other things to point out based on the before and (hopeful) after pictures?
