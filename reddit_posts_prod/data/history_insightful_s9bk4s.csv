Any historical evidence supporting the claim that some Greek philosophers were taught by Ethiopians?,aincs22,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/s9bk4s/any_historical_evidence_supporting_the_claim_that/,294,1296,"I am just curious about the validity and historical evidence supporting these claims. Ethiopia is one of the only African countries to have oral literature alongside written literature in ancient times. Surely their interactions with Greek philosophers would be recorded and written on?

Any credible peer reviewed articles or historical documentaries/ primary sources would be really appreciated üôèüèΩ

*UPDATE: Thank you for all the comments and insights. One comment suggested the ‚ÄòHistory of Philosophy Without Any Gaps Podcast‚Äô which has an episode on Ethiopian Philosophy (ep 11). I took a look and found they also had an episode (ep 8.) on Ethiopian philosophy and Greek philosophy, giving what I think is a comprehensive explanation of their relationship and exchange of ideas. The podcast comes with numerous sources that are written below the podcast for anyone concerned about credibility.

Here is the link to the episode: https://historyofphilosophy.net/early-ethiopia"
