What movie Podcasts are you listening to that aren't just new movie reviews?,oceans47,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1910esz/what_movie_podcasts_are_you_listening_to_that/,904,478,"I've got to drive a lot these days and was looking for good movie podcasts, but everything I find is just reviewing new movies out in theaters, or talking about upcoming movie gossip.

I'm looking for something a little more interesting and fun, or at least a more in depth conversation about movies than just ""here's what's new this week that's worth seeing.""

Got any good recommendations?"
