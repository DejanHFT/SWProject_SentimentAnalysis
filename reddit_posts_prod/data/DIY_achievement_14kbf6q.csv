Kitchen cupboards - vynil or paint?,HansKolpinghuis,https://i.redd.it/bb2n394wsj8b1.jpg,13,5,"Hello! I've bought a flat that has got this very ugly kitchen that in planning on remodeling. I'd like a white marble effect countertop, black cabinets and gold handles to match (will be replacing the tiles to match the white)

I was planning on redoing the cabinets myself. They're MDF with a thick laminate that it's peeling off in some places, so I think removing it would be the best idea.

I am a bit in two minds about how to achieve a good finish. Would it be best to prime and paint them over, or to buy some sticky vynil to re-laminate them? I am aware that the laminate would be way thinner than the one already there so idk if this would be a good solution?

Thanks!!"
