How to keep consistent motivation and overcoming instant gratification?,youngdollasign,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1pu5ck/how_to_keep_consistent_motivation_and_overcoming/,36,66,"I suppose this applies to a lot of people. I see a lot of suggestions in which people become motivated through the progress they make - they see results and are inspired to continue.


In my case I find motivation from some initial thought or from wanting to change, and I start doing something (this can apply to many things, fitness is just a good example). 


So in my example, I started body weight training and eating properly a little while ago, and actually saw really steady results - my chest and arms got far bigger and I clearly got stronger. At this stage I start to feel better and once I feel better I get complacent and find it much easier to avoid working out or bettering myself (and eventually go back to feeling worse).


I have become so used to instant gratification (namely through online gaming - im extremely competitive, I guess alcohol and other drugs but i respect and enjoy drugs enough not to abuse them). The internet gives one something to do at ANY given time so motivation that comes from being in a bad place is hard to maintain once you start feeling better.


I'm aware this sounds quite backwards, but I'm sure others have experienced it.  Does anyone have any particular advice to move forward with this? I have learned over the years that it's perfectly possible to take action without even a shred of motivation, but it does sincerely help to have some.

edit - thanks for the responses.  I think lack of routine is most definitely the main detriment! Still it's certainly something that's interesting to discuss - it can impact a lot of areas."
