[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/elemental-review-pixar-1235502286/):

>The elements all fit perfectly into place — so much so that the creative flames are doused, and we’re left without much of an impression.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/elemental-review-pixar-1235626948/):

>I reckon there are more ideas per second of screentime in “Elemental” than any other Pixar movie to date. So why does this imagination-teasing opposites-attract rom-com feel like a misfire?

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2023/05/elemental-review-disney-pixar-cannes-film-festival-1235381852/):

>New Pixar Animation Is Visually Splendid, But Swamped In Syrupy Sentiment

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/elemental-review-pixar-1234868054/) (B):

>As conflicted as they come: a heavy-handed, mixed bag immigrant metaphor punctuated by a genuinely moving romance. It gets frequently lost down the rabbit-hole of its own conceptual details but yields occasionally stunning images and thoughtful aesthetics

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/elemental-review-cannes/):

>With story beats and character turns that strain well beyond familiarity, Elemental matches formal adventure with storytelling timidity. Here is a new spin on the old formula, livened up by advances in technology and delivered with real artistry. The film is full of complex and volatile parts, all held together in the most elemental of containers.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/elemental-review-pixar/) (3/5):

>A sweet-natured love story, well-intentioned, animated and acted, but lacking the depth of some of the studio’s greatest triumphs.

[Screen Daily](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/elemental-cannes-review/5182636.article):

>Elemental contains hints of the studio’s wit and poignancy while lacking the inspired execution that once seemed so effortless.

[Daily Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/elemental-cannes-2023-pixar-review/) (3/5):

>While unlikely to feature on many people’s favourite Pixar lists, Elemental brings with it the satisfying creak of a ship being righted.

[The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/elemental-film-review-pixar-0ctbqdq0k) (3/5):

>A flawed but big-hearted tale of forbidden love.

[Next Best Picture](https://nextbestpicture.com/elemental/) (8/10):

>""Elemental"" will warm your heart and move you to tears.

[London Evening Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/film/elemental-movie-review-pixar-fire-water-damp-squib-b1082196.html) (2/5):

>For all Elemental’s many charms, this nonsensical film simply doesn’t cut the mustard.
