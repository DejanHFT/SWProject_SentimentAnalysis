Best lesser known strategy games?,Dimitar98,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/njer71/best_lesser_known_strategy_games/,19,3,"We all know that XCOM, TW, Civ, HoI, EU, CK, Stellaris, Starcraft are great, but are there any lesser known strategy games that all fans of the genre should try? I wanted to ask this question because I just recently tried Panzer Corps 2(a turn based hex based WW2 game) and I really like it. It may not have the high budget of the games I listed at the start of this post, but I found the campaign thoroughly enjoyable.

Edit: I wrote the post in a rush so let me mention some more games:

Company of Heroes, Homeworld, Age of empires, Warcraft"
