Bootstrap Bill from Pirates of the Caribbean had one of the worst fates of any character in cinema.,Respectable_Fuckboy,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16e204j/bootstrap_bill_from_pirates_of_the_caribbean_had/,258,1835,"“Strapped to a cannon at the bottom of the ocean. Unable to move, unable to die.”

With the recently heightened knowlege we all have about water pressure because of a certain submarine, I can honestly say that Bootstrap Bill was in a place even worse than purgatory. 

He was in the pitch black, suffocating, paralyzed, freezing, with the weight of the entire ocean pressing down on him while he felt it all. Even more? He thought it was never going to end. 

I’d sell my soul to an eternity of servitude a billion times over to escape that. Davey Jones did him a favor, and we don’t even know how long he left him down there. 

Also, I know that Barbosa says they “feel nothing” but several of the cursed pirates scream in pain multiple times. So I have to believe he still had to feel something. If anything, claustrophobia from being trapped down there."
