Antidepressants and inspiration.,Security_Man2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/8r0uk1/antidepressants_and_inspiration/,36,7,"Hello all,

I have been suffering from depression for a number of years and have been on anti depressants for a lot of that time. As such I have noticed that my inspiration for new writing has ebbed and flowed with the times I am on the pills and when I am not. My question is this, to others with depression have you found you are affected in a similar way? How do you get over it? Did you change pills? Did it work? I am trying to see whether this is similar to a placebo effect where I am assuming that taking the pills will dent my creativity or whether there is a known correlation between anti depressants and the creative process. Figured here was as good a place to ask as any as this sub is full of active writers and depression is relatively common."
