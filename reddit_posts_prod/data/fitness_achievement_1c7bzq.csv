Sitting in a wheelchair with several handicaps. What is realisticly achievable?,dhevos,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1c7bzq/sitting_in_a_wheelchair_with_several_handicaps/,15,65,"So i'm a 22yr ( 1,68m 52kg) who is using a wheelchair since several months now after my dysmelia didn't allow me to wear a right leg prothesis anymore.
I already have experiences in a fitness center in which i was several months but had to leave due to personal issues which are now (mostly) resolved. Though still would like to see what is possible to find a gym in the future which is fitting for me.

As stated i'm currently pretty underweight which usually was no problem because it wouldn't hurt my 1 working knee with arthritis too much due to the weight but now its not a matter anymore. Also my right hand ( 4 fingers) leave me with some problems with the grip especially when i used the machine to pull a bar from overhead behind my back (don't know the exact term in english sorry :/ ). Plus due to a missing muscle my right arm isnt as powerful as my left so i am uncertain if ever could do weights without machines because i'm not sure if it would be ok with the balance.

Mainly i'm looking for looks instead of raw strenght and just to be getting ""bigger"" or as buff as possible with my stature. Does anyone have experience with such handicaps?"
