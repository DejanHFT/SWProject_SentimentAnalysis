Employability of Astronomy,itanamulli,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/6oyltz/employability_of_astronomy/,19,9,"So I'm going to university/college in a year, I'm hoping to go into astronomy, but I've heard its not very good for work. So i was wondering how difficult it is for some of you astronomers to find work, and what level of education you have? Should i get a PhD, Masters, or is University enough? "
