What motivates you to workout?,chrisgelb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/vvhwt/what_motivates_you_to_workout/,179,58,I'm average guy. Not fat. Not slim. I don't have six packs. When I get home around 8pm after work and when I lie in bed or I'm on the internet I lost all my drive to get my ass up and workout. We all experienced that feeling when you are already comfortable and doesn't want to get up anymore. So what motivates you to sweat out?
