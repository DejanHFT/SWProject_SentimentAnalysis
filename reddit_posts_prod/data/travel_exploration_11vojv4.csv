Best carribean Island(s) to explore the culture,doctormdphdmscmsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/11vojv4/best_carribean_islands_to_explore_the_culture/,10,1,"I am planning a 2 week trip to the carribean with a friend for the winter of 2024. I don't want this vacation to just be an all inclusive where you never leave the resort and explore the towns and parks of the island. Rather, I see this as a ""cultural"" vacation in the same sense as one would see a trip to Portugal or Peru.

Given that, I would really appreciate advice on which islands are the most interesting beyond the beaches and resorts - though beaches are still somewhat important. I like walking through different towns, going on hikes, trying local cuisine, going to local pubs and other such activities.

From what I have heard from friends, some of the places that are best for this kind of trip include Belize - which, yes, is not an island - and St. Martens.

Thanks for your input"
