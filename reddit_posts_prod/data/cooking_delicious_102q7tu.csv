Any fruitcake bakers out there? Let's share our terrible and delicious craft.,Priority_Pony,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/102q7tu/any_fruitcake_bakers_out_there_lets_share_our/,16,45,"I've been baking rum fruitcakes for about five years now. I really enjoy the process and I get a lot of compliments on them when I give them away for the holidays. I've also gotten questioning looks from folks who haven't tried them, which I think is fun, because they can be so good but have such a bad reputation. Does anyone else like to bake fruitcakes? What are your experiences?
