At what point in Human history did we start using pillows/head support when sleeping?,jchaines,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q6omr/at_what_point_in_human_history_did_we_start_using/,465,825,"I know that when you're young you can get a flat spot on the back of your head from lying on it too much, I imagine if you slept without a pillow that would happen eventually too into adulthood. What's up with pillows and soft head support in general?  At what point did someone decide keeping their head slightly supported might be nice and can scientists see this change in anyway looking at historical records of any sort?

Edit: This question seems to be getting traction but only a couple answers noting Egyptians and monkeys and such so far.  Any anthropologists/(other areas of science that may be relevant) out there that have far better data to show then me Googling ""When was the pillow invented""? ;)  Thanks for the responses so far everyone!

Edit 2:  I probably should have asked this to r/askscience. :P. Will upvote anyone who does. :)"
