Comparing adventure travel companies,bobblebob100,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/yolj6w/comparing_adventure_travel_companies/,9,1,"I do alot of trekking in Nepal such as Base Camp, Annapurna etc and other places like Peru. Ive always used Exodus Travels as found there trips very organised and customer service is great.

I do notice tho that G Adventures, Intrepid and alike offer similar trips. In terms of Everest Base Camp the itinerary is almost identical to Exodus Travels but is half the price for land only

Anyone used both to compare as im not sure how 1 can be double the price of the other"
