Intrepid or G adventures,Stunning-Lioness777,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16putzn/intrepid_or_g_adventures/,26,4,"I found these two travel companies that look very reputable, but I am not sure which is better or how good they are. I will be a single female traveling alone and I would love to do some sightseeing, but only with a guided group for safety reasons. The G adventures and intrepid seems to offer some great excursions, but I am not sure about the use of their hotels. One of the hotels listed has mixed reviews and I was wondering if anyone had any person experiences  with either. Also, do either help very much with airfare and coordinating with flights? intrepid says it helps with pre and post adventure accommodations but does not go into great detail on the site."
