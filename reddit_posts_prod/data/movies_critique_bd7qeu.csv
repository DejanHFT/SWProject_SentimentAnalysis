"The movie: Climax by Gaspar Noé (2018) Oppinions, Critique, Interpretations?",Ponono1910,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/bd7qeu/the_movie_climax_by_gaspar_noé_2018_oppinions/,5,0,"Just watched the movie ""Climax"" by Gaspar Noé. One of the most disturbing movies I've watched so far. A friend of mine played the movie, without any warning and after finishing it I still feel really uncomfortable with the pictures. The whole movie for me was a mix of ""This is pure psychological and physicall violence and disgusting"" but at the same time I wasn't able to look away and was interested how unfolding mayhem will play out. Right now I don't know how to process and interpret the movie. That's why I'm interested in your oppinion on the movie and what you made out of it."
