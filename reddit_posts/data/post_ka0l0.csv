Is the universe deterministic?,TacticalAdvanceToThe,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ka0l0/is_the_universe_deterministic/,135,73,"Read something interesting in an exercise submitted by a student I'm a teaching assistant for in an AI course. His thoughts were that since the physical laws are deterministic, then in the future a computer could make a 100% correct simulation of a human, which would mean that a computer can think. What do you guys think? Does Heisenberg's uncertainty principle have something to do with this and if so, how?"
