I just discovered Deftones,godiegoben,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/13h3qrd/i_just_discovered_deftones/,808,3920,It’s not just the music. It’s the SOUND. I haven’t in so long had sound hit my ears in just the right spots over and over again. I can’t believe it’s taken so long. I can’t wait to know every word. I love Deftones. And my soul is going vroom vroom.
