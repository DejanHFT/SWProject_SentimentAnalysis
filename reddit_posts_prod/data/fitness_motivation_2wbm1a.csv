Thanks to everyone for voting me **[""best weight loss transformation of 2014""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2req7z/winners_of_the_rfitness_best_of_2014_awards/)**. I'm back for another installment of my journey from fat to fit as requested by many of you. This is my third installment of my journey. Here is the original post from last year: **[Clinically obese(class II) to ripped](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/21yvse/my_3_year_transformation_from_clinically_obese/)**

My goal for this is to offer a simple blueprint that anyone can use. When I first began this journey i had no idea where to start. I'm going to highlight all my strategies that have worked in the hopes of helping someone who is in a similar predicament.

**Recap and update**
---------------------
---------------------
 
* Back in 2011 I was an **[obese, depressed, alcoholic, smoker.](http://i.imgur.com/JEKYYNg.jpg)**

* After becoming fed up with my sloppyness and lack of dates, I started dieting and **[running on a treadmill.](http://i.imgur.com/NJWhPjM.jpg)**

* I lost 80lbs, quit smoking and drinking and got **[really skinny.](http://i.imgur.com/CQtMdX7.png)**

* Having lost so much weight, I had accumulated some **[loose skin.](http://i.imgur.com/mIFxjAB.png)**

* Luckily, I am privileged enough to afford the surgery to remove said skin so I took the dive and **[got the surgery.](http://i.imgur.com/XLGMNYs.jpg)**

* After the skin had gone I finally felt I could achieve a beach body and decided to enter a physique competition, more as a challenge to myself than anything else. **[Here I am on stage in October at the Iron Man Natural.](http://i.imgur.com/5qPbxJR.jpg)**

* **[Here is the full album from the event.](http://imgur.com/a/clV63)**

* Since the competition I have transitioned into my first **intentional** bulk ever. The mental aspect of this is incredibly difficult. Keep in mind I have been dieting consistently for almost 4 years. To reverse that mentality and actually welcome weight gain has proven to be a challenge. 

* The beginning of the bulk was awesome. I was still lean from my competition but started filling out from the increased calories. **[This gym selfie](http://i.imgur.com/qtrJ7YZ.jpg)** I took got featured on a fitness motivation **[Instagram account.](http://instagram.com/p/vZeZnUjecV)**

* At the beginning of this year my local gym asked me if I would model for them as they needed pics for a new gym website. I wasn't expecting this opportunity and was not as lean as I would have liked. I agreed to the photo shoot and tried my best to dehydrate and carb load.

---------------------
**Diet**
---------------------
---------------------

* I've tried almost every diet and had some success with a few of them but the philosophy I choose to follow today is that of IIFYM or counting macros.

* Counting macros is not a diet per se but more a way of eating that makes you aware of what you are ingesting. To count macros you use a calorie counter to track all the foods you eat and then look at the macro nutrient breakdowns of those foods and eat in an intentional way that will hit your goal number of carbs, fats and proteins. In this way you can still subscribe to a more food specific diet but doing so with this strategy makes you conscious of your macros.

* For my show prep I did a classic bodybuilder prep diet consisting of tilapia, brown rice and broccoli. Although I was not IIFYM dieting, I did calculate the macros to be **45 fat, 145 carb and 225 protein(1,885 calories)**. I got incredibly lean doing this but it was unnecessarily difficult.

* After the competition I began increasing my calories slowly by about 15 carbs and 3 fats a week. This is called a reverse diet and it's purpose is to allow your body to adjust to increased calories without putting on excess fat. My current lean bulking macros are **60 fat, 400 carb and 200 protein(2,940 calories)**. I've gained a total of 20lbs since beginning this increase. **[Start](http://i.imgur.com/bryeDrv.jpg)** and **[now](http://i.imgur.com/PBVRnCD.jpg)**

* **Supplements:** creatine, fish oil, multivitamin. I have never used steroids or pro-hormones.


---------------------
**Training**
---------------------
---------------------

* Towards the end of my show prep, when I was reaching low single digit body fat percentages, my strength took a steep dive. Since my show, I have been focusing much of my time in the gym on strength.

* I do Jim Wendler's Boring But Big 5/3/1 strength protocol. Here is a link to **[the program](http://www.jimwendler.com/2013/05/boring-but-big/)** and the **[5/3/1 calculator](http://blackironbeast.com/5/3/1/calculator)**. This program is for intermediate lifters. My favorite beginner program is ICF 5x5. **[Here is a graphic with the specific exercises](http://i.imgur.com/RmTpFHC.jpg)**.




**Current one rep maxes:**

OHP: 145lb

Squat: 315lb

Bench: 240lb

DL: 405lb


---------------------
**Motivation**
---------------------
---------------------

* **""How do you stay motivated?""** This is the most frequent question I've received from my reddit posts and it’s difficult to answer.

* Originally my motivation was to look better and not be ignored by girls. This kept me going for a while but if that were my only motivation I would have fallen off a long time ago. Today my motivation is intrinsic, it comes from within. Lifting weights is part of who I am. It’s not something I try to get out of the way any more. I cherish my time in the gym.

* In the early days, to get through times of low motivation, I made the gym part of my routine. If I didn't think about it, I wouldn't think my way out of it. After work everyday I went to the gym on my way home. Instead of being home from work at 4:30, I was home at 5:30 because I went to the gym first. Making myself go was the hardest part.

---------------------
**Things I wish I had known**
---------------------

---------------------

* **Cardio<Weights<Diet** - This is the order of importance if an aesthetically appealing physique is the goal. Diet is the most important part of gaining or losing weight. To gain or lose weight in order to achieve an aesthetic figure, weight training is paramount. Cardio is a tool to use in conjunction with diet and weights to help achieve a caloric deficit.

* **Tracking** - If your goal is to achieve an aesthetic physique, tracking is a must. Tracking your diet, body weight and the weights you lift gives you the ability to view progress and analyze the variables. Being able to manipulate these variables is essential to break through plateaus. MyFitnessPal is great for tracking.

A couple years ago I was sitting on my computer reading posts like this one, wondering if it was possible for me to do the same thing. It ***was*** possible for me and it ***is*** possible for you too. I am not naturally a fit person. The success I have found has come from consistent positive choices.

-
If you are thinking about starting your own fitness journey, **DO IT**. You'll be glad you did. The way I feel is great, the way I look is awesome but the biggest difference is the way I'm treated today. I feel a sense of respect from complete strangers and people seem to **WANT** to talk to me. I'm still getting used to it, but it's awesome.

I'll answer any questions you may have. I'm an open book. I have no secrets.
