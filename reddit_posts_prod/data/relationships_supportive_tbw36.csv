What can I do to be more supportive to my husband's sobriety?,idnyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tbw36/what_can_i_do_to_be_more_supportive_to_my/,56,31,"We're both 22 and we have twins.  We met when he was 19 and he was a heavy user. He did handfuls of ecstacy for days on end, coke, snorted heroin, adderal, lortab/percoset/xanax and of course, drank heavily. He came from an abusive home, not that it's an excuse, but it makes sense why he did so many drugs.


Both of my parents were meth addicts until I was about 12. In my teens, I was really close to my uncle and he was also an addict - heroin, though. He commit suicide when I was 17. 


My uncle's death messed me up. It's hard to explain but..  when I first met my husband (through a friend), I saw the same thing in his eyes that I always saw in my uncle's. Pain, sorrow, and running like hell from something. I remember specifically thinking, ""I could redeem myself with (husband) for what I did wrong with (uncle)""


Looking back, this could have gone horribly wrong. Anyway, we got really close and I opened up to him about my parents and my uncle, and drug addicts being in and out of my life for the majority of my life. I remember crying while telling him about the pain that was shot through me when I heard my uncle killed himself. We were close, but hadn't revealed our feelings for each other. I made the general statement that, ""I could never date someone that used drugs so heavily.""

He quit the next day, and a few weeks later we started dating. We kind of saved each other, I'm bipolar and in the year before he and I met, I was severely unstable. Along with him going clean, he encouraged me to get help and so we kind of pulled each other out of the mud.


Now, we've been married 19 months and have 18 month old twins. We have a very strong, loving, and healthy relationship. He is an abso-fucking-lutely  **amazing**  father. Our boys love him so much, they watch out the window for him to get home from work each day. He is a goddamn amazing husband in every sense of the term. He works hard, he provides like a boss. Our love life and love in general is still really strong and fulfilling. Despite him coming from an abusive home, he has never been even slightly violent. Hell, he has never even yelled at me.  He's brilliant, intelligent, loving.


ANYWAY. Enough gushing about my pride towards him.


He hasn't done any drugs aside from an occasional joint since he quit, and he only drinks socially when the boys are spending time with my parents. But when he does drink socially, he gets hammered.


So, over the past month or so... He's been opening up to me about the extent of the drug and alcohol abuse and about the family he came from. I won't go into detail about the family stuff, but it is some pretty fucked up shit.


He's been holding a lot of the using against himself. Talking about being a horrible person and what not. He's been off drugs for awhile, but it's like the urges are just now kicking in... or at least to the extent that he needed to tell me. He told me when he gets stressed, he can't stop thinking about drugs and how they'd so effortlessly take all of his frustration away. He says he often feels depressed and that makes the urges stronger. He is also feeling guilty about the fact that he glorifies drugs in his mind. He said it's just terrifying to him because he is honestly scared that if it's offered to him, he won't be able to deny it.


Being that I am the child of former drug addicts, I told him that I would never let them go through what I did.


I told him that I am not going to leave him, that I am going to unconditionally support him however I can, and that I will not let him slip. I told him he has one thing he did not have when he was an addict, and that is me.


We talked and decided that he's going to see a therapist, look into AA & NA, and possibly see a doctor to take care of the depression at least temporarily.


Other than that, I'm not sure what **I** can actively do for him. I have a loooong history of dealing with drug addicts, but not of helping them stay/become clean. It took my parents about 2 years to stay consistently clean. My uncle was clean for about a month when he killed himself. And all the other drug addicts, they go back and forth.


I do not want him to be a ""back and forth"" addict. I will not allow my kids to carry that burden and I refuse to spend my life without him. I think he's doing great, especially since he is so strong willed. But I just need some advice on how to keep him focused on anything BUT drugs, and to keep his confidence up and make him realize that who is now is an entirely different person.


I'm not scared yet.. but I don't want to get that far and then not know what to do. We're thinking about even moving. His mother died in 2010, and we inheritted the house he lived in since he was 4. This house is in a small town filled with easy access to drugs.


Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated.




**tl;dr: Husband and I are in our early twenties with two young sons. He used to be a drug addict, has been clean for almost 3 years. Lately, he has been having urges but so far has not given in. Need advice on how to keep him confident about staying clean and how to help him deal with the urges.**"
