Death By Nostalgia,seeing_the_light,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/e8uo5/death_by_nostalgia/,4,4,"This is one short blurb in THE REAL FRANK ZAPPA BOOK:

>When you compute the length of time between the ""EVENT"" and ""THE NOSTALGIA FOR THE EVENT"", the span seems to be about a year less in every cycle. 
Eventually the nostalgia cycles will be so close together that people will not be able to take a step without being nostalgic for the one they just took.
At that point, everything stops. DEATH BY NOSTALGIA.

Frank Zappa is one of those guys whose music is hit or miss, but his *ideas* are really interesting. I would recommend that book to anyone interested in the sort of philosophy that comes from life experience instead of books (infact, Zappa claims to not read much at all, because books put him to sleep).

Why I highlight this paragraph now is that I believe the internet in general, and memes in particular (or, more precisely, the way we have come to *use* memes), have brought upon the final step in this ""death by nostalgia"". People rarely do any critical or open-ended thinking anymore, most of their info comes from a 5 min glance at a wikipedia page, and whenever *anything* comes up, there is that subset of people who will do nothing but fall back on ideas they can already relate it to, without thinking about the idea on its own merit. The problem is this subset is growing daily.

I don't think the solution is simply telling people to think more or ""think for themselves"", as those have become memes in themselves that point to nothing in actuality but already tired ideas. People who truly ""think for themselves"" do not need to be told to, nor would they be likely to even put what they do in those terms. To them, they are just ""thinking"". 

How can we reverse this situation? Is it even possible with the growing reliance on technology, and the tendency for people to gravitate to whatever is easiest for them? 

Are we going to be a race of people who survive endless war, poverty and famine, but end up dying because of our own self-induced apathy and laziness?

**EDIT:** I just re-read this sentence: ""and whenever anything comes up, there is that subset of people who will do nothing but fall back on ideas they can already relate it to, without thinking about the idea on its own merit.""

Just want to clear up that, obviously, anything new idea we contemplate involves relating it to things we already know, what I mean more specifically are people reducing a complex concept to fit an easier model which doesn't do justice to the original concept and may only have incidental or peripheral things in common with it. (ie, by someone saying that they understand the nuances of Plato's cave because they watched the Matrix, for example)"
