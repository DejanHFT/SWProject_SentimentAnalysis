Solo exploration on West Coast USA,Chrysalexx,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/14ze7b8/solo_exploration_on_west_coast_usa/,9,0,"Hey team, looking for some advice and insights from the experts on Reddit. For the whole of September I’m visiting the US where a mate and I are travelling from San Fran - Tahoe - Yellowstone - Zion - Vegas - San Diego. After that she has to return to work while I still have another week before I fly out from San Fran. As well as advice and recommendations for the above locations, what’s some good solo exploration routes for a young female starting from either the San Diego or San Fran area? I potentially can use my friend’s car, otherwise I’ll need other modes of transport. I can stay in SF for free, but I’m keen to see more of the country in some self journey kinda shit before I leave and likely never return. I don’t mind what I do; I’m not a big fan of cities (hence why we’re camping in Yellowstone for a week), but up for anything in any direction. I don’t have much experience solo travelling, hence why I’m asking for some help. Thanks folks!"
