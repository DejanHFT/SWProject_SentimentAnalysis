A whole bunch of SPAM,spcdownrange,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/161wptz/a_whole_bunch_of_spam/,413,442,"No not the junk in your inbox. The stuff you find for cheap in a tin can. My dad has given me a bunch of it. He loves it. I never ate it growing up but now that I’m older and have a more adventurous tummy I’m game. What’s the best meal to prepare with it? I’ve heard fried spam is delicious for breakfast. Any and all ideas are appreciated! TIA.

EDIT: THANK YOU FOR ALL THE RESPONSES. I did not expect to get this many delicious ideas. I will be starting with a few this week and will try to eventually get to them all."
