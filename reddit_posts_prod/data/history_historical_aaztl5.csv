How were historically large companies managed?,skydivingbigfoot,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/aaztl5/how_were_historically_large_companies_managed/,22,656,"Hello all. I was wondering how the largest companies were managed (e.g. East India Company) when communication was so slow. Were company vital purchases bought and supplied based on past purchase requests? Or were materials stockpiled in different regions so they could be distributed as needed? What about vital decision making needs?

Edit: added some words"
