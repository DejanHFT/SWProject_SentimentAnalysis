Looking for simple but delicious/gourmet appetizer recipes,82PKOrpheus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/16a3jjg/looking_for_simple_but_deliciousgourmet_appetizer/,45,34,I'm hosting a get together this coming Saturday. We decided to go all appetizers and skip any main dishes. I have an excellent spinach dip recipe that my friends all love. I'll share it in the comments. What is an amazing appetizer dish that you serve that gets rave reviews?
