Basement Ceiling Solution,Delicious-Hunt-9819,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18n1mt4,1,1,"So this is my girlfriends disaster of a basement ceiling that I want to help her improve

My first (and possibly irresponsible) idea is to handle all of the spaghetti wires and lackluster lighting fixtures then cover the entire ceiling with a fire rated acoustic fabric as a quick, clean and easy way to achieve a uniform, somewhat finished looking ceiling.

I suppose my other route would be a proper job of dry walling or installing a drop ceiling but I feel that fire retardant fabric stapled to the beams could be a simple improvement

I’m not looking to be the reason my girlfriends house burns down so feel free to shoot me down if this is a downright terrible idea

If you think it could work I’d appreciate some tips and thoughts, thanks!."
