Christmas Adventure,RockieRoo916,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/y05pcx/christmas_adventure/,6,2,"This year has been a massive shift for me. LTR (22 yrs) ended and job change are just a few biggies. I no longer have family and I've never had a great fondness for commercial US Christmas - I only qualify that it's US, since I don't know if the rest of the world has desecrated the holiday. 

I don't want to sit pathetically alone for Christmas. I've been considering a 3 week vacation at the end of the year. I'm considering Scotland, Northern Italy, the Azores, Patagonia or Antarctica. I'd like to do historical tours of lesser known or obscure locations, and culinary adventures. Near an ocean or bay would be the icing. And, I'd like to avoid huge tourist destinations. 

 There are places I'd rather not travel to; Africa (I hate heat), mainland China (interested but not now), Russia (for obvious reasons), the Middle East (I don't know enough about the region to feel comfortable traveling alone as a single woman), and Mexico (been there, done that).

Oh, and I can speak Spanish enough to find a beer, a doctor, a bathroom and a restaurant. Otherwise, I'd prefer to travel to a destination that accepts English. 

Obviously, my thought pattern is all over the place. Any suggestions?  I'm not limited to the destinations I shared above. I'm open to other ideas. 

TIA"
