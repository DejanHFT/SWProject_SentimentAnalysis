Should 30k in 9 days be inspiring or worrying?,Incitrica,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/16n8bjt/should_30k_in_9_days_be_inspiring_or_worrying/,24,1,"Hey Everyone,

I've recently moved onto my second story, one a bit more mainstream than my original idea for a debut. I swear the story crafted in my mind so quickly and I mapped out the whole thing in 2 days. I began writing two sundays ago and I'm now at 30k already. At this rate I might finish this manuscript draft in a month. Writing is currently something I'm doing in my freetime so it feels weird for everything to be going so quickly. Should I be worried or is this a sign that things are going great? 

Any advice or things I should look out for by writing quickly, please let me know! Maybe this is normal? Not sure haha."
