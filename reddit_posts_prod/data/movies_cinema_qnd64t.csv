I love Cinema Paradiso so much and it's quite strange how little this film gets talked about,AHonterMustHont,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/qnd64t/i_love_cinema_paradiso_so_much_and_its_quite/,51,93,"This film was recommended to me by a friend and I came in with very little expectation. Turned out I was completely sucked in from start to finish. 

On paper, it sounds just like a run-of-the-mill story of a man's childhood, but it is incredibly relatable for me even though the protagonist and myself come from two completely different cultures. It feels like this version of boyhood that I've been longing for. I guess the emphasis on the love for cinema is the element that helps connect me with the film so brilliantly. 

The main score of this film is phenomenal, it has this special vibe that makes me think of a Ghibli film, very nostalgic, sweet, and calming. Throughout the 2 hour runtime, it manages to wet my eyes over and over. 

To me, it's not just a regular childhood story of a guy, but rather a beautifully conveyed message about knowing your dream and chasing after it, understanding the necessary sacrifice one has to make in the progress, knowing how to let go of many things in our life that we may once consider an inseparable part of our life, which may be a person or a cinema where our dream was once nurtured.  You are busy adapting to all those things while time itself is busy moving on, taking away eventually everything while at the same time bringing on new things to your life.

 I've been through similar phases in my life so seeing how the protagonist learns all these things is such a beautiful look back for me.

I'd recommend the 2-hour version if you haven't watched it. There is a director's cut which is about half an hour longer but IMO it's worse than the 2-hour one. It kind of ruins some key character development and the overall pacing, better ignore it if you can. This also makes me consider this film to be a case study of the importance of a good editor in filmmaking in general.

Overall, really great film. I have this category of films that I rewatch occasionally to remind myself just how precious life is, this is sitting right next to the likes of ""The Intouchables""."
