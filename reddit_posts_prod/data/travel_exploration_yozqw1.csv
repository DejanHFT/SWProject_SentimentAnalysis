"New Istanbul Airport, want to explore it. Advice?",xmarksthespotusa,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/yozqw1/new_istanbul_airport_want_to_explore_it_advice/,7,4,"Hello. I've heard that the new IST airport is the nicest new international hub (with the exception of Singapore Changi). As such, when I visit Istanbul in a few days, I would like to spend some time exploring IST airport itself - either after I land or before I depart. I will have my travel belongings in one backpack, so no big luggage debacle for me. 

A couple of questions:

* If I wanted to drop off the backpack and just grab a tag, walk around (like you can do at Changi), where can I do that? 
* Are most of the shopping (e.g., Turkish bazaar), dining and art galleries pre-security/landside (like at Changi) or post-security/airside?
* Is there anything ""must see,"" in your opinion, at IST?

TIA!"
