Dating the Roman siege of Jerusalem,MathematicianReal472,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/xhf73u/dating_the_roman_siege_of_jerusalem/,22,111,"The year of the Roman siege of Jerusalem and destruction of the second temple seems to be universally accepted as 70 CE.  My question is, what are the ancient sources being cited for this date?  I haven't had much luck tracking down that information.

By ""ancient sources"", I mean something beyond citing a modern history book, which cites another modern historical author, who cites another.  What I'm trying to locate is an ancient text that identifies the year in which this event took place, either putting a number to it, or referencing something else that can be numerically dated.  Multiple sources would be even better.

I understand Josephus was an eyewitness but I'm unclear on whether he actually states the year in which these events took place.  Does anyone know if the date of 70 CE is flatly stated somewhere, possibly in any records of the actions of Titus (who led the siege), or is it rather a computed date based on other known dates?

Thanks"
