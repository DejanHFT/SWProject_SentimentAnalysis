I’m creatively stuck designing this championship belt.,Cant-all-be-winners,https://i.redd.it/7swwgz19b2ob1.jpg,4,4,"I’ve been working on this belt for a made up wrestling company, but I’ve run into a block. 

I’m mostly happy with what I’ve come up with, but the outer shape is bothering me, and I’m having trouble coming up with anything better. I know I want the wings to extend off the main shape, though. Any ideas? I’m also thinking a more intricate border might help, but I’m stuck on that as well. 

I’m also open to general thoughts on the design as well, but there are still some missing elements (like a fire like texturing in the background and on the bottom) that I plan to add. I really like the idea of the bottom banner being an unrolled scroll, but I’m not sure I’m satisfied with how this looks. I like the wildness of the top banner, though.

I’m designing this with the idea to have it acid etched, so the colors just denote raised and low areas and different layers. Really just as a way to keep things straight while I’m laying things out. 

Any thoughts?"
