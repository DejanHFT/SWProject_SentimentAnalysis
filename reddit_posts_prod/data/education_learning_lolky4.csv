I am in a district and school that have been on an improvement plan since I’ve been there. 5 years. I’ve seen district consultants come and go. Building-wide priorities and mandates come and go. It took me awhile to realize that a lot of these things are a consequence of our SIP providing grant money requiring strategies and data to support the impact of the programs we adopted. But none of these programs track their impact longitudinally. Over a longer period of time than one year. I have access to student achievement data in our district and none of these things are making a dent. 

We have good leadership. Good Principals. Good support staff. I don’t think these are staffing problems. It seems to me that the SIP system itself contributes to the problem, rather than work towards solutions. 

I don’t know where to go to find out if that if that is just an anecdotal observation, if I’m wrong, or if it is a broader problem. 

TIA"
