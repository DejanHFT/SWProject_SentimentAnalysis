Where do you find inspiration for dialogue?,Cwchenery,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/vwz0w0/where_do_you_find_inspiration_for_dialogue/,32,23,"Dialogue is by far my favorite element of writing. Be it novels, screenplays or comics. I am at my happiest when creating character dialogue. Where do you find inspiration for the words your character's speak? 

I know many people suggest just listening to people speak, and I started that when I was first writing, but I find day to day small talk to be mundane and really doesn't make for interesting character communication and development. Especially in a screenplay where time is limted and every word matters. 

I'm interested to see where others get their inspiration as I'm always looking to better my craft."
