Looking for new adventure before having kids,CremeDoomlee,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/b5w14c/looking_for_new_adventure_before_having_kids/,39,2,"Hey travel gurus! My husband and I are having one last vacation before starting our family. Travel dates are June 7-9. We're in AZ and haven't traveled much at all. We've been to Vegas a few times as well as Austin. My hubby has been to San Diego a bunch and I used to live in Portland OR. We've been to Savannah, coastal Georgia, Florida, and the Baltimore area for work. We're shooting for a place that neither of us has been before. 

Given that we have such limited vacation time, we want to fly into wherever we're staying and avoid driving a bunch to get places. We like outdoor activities like hiking and kayaking and are total foodies. My husband loves seafood and we both like breweries.  I'm mostly looking for location recommendations as we haven't narrowed it down at all at this point. If you want any more info to help me out, please ask, thanks!!"
