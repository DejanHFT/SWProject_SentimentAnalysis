I’ve got 30 apples and no sweet tooth. How can I use them up in a delicious way?,myorangeseashell,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/19clx35/ive_got_30_apples_and_no_sweet_tooth_how_can_i/,207,96,"I love sweet and savory together but don’t really do pie or pastry if that makes sense.

Update 1: I definitely had a mental block about apples but I am so grateful for all this creative inspiration! Maybe I love apples now? Thank you!

Update 2:
Ya’ll really do love apples!"
