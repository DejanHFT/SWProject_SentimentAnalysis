"8 long years of trial & error, sweat, grueling workouts, a near perfect diet, and a goal that finally got achieved",BabiesGotTheBends,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8skhqu/8_long_years_of_trial_error_sweat_grueling/,601,10460,"Well...here it is...https://imgur.com/a/xw1rqB8

I occasionally post progress pictures on IG if you'd like to follow me - @austin.sure

Started at 275lbs and now down to 170!

Here's the breakdown of how this actually went down. To begin, this picture is from when I had already lost 50 pounds (so around 210-220).

The first 50 pounds was lost 100% through using a keto diet paired with strict calorie counting. I kept my daily calorie intake around 1400-1600 per day and it took approximately 4 months to shed the first 50 pounds. Again, no exercise was used, barely even walks around the neighborhood.

The next 50-60 pounds, I decided I'd like to speed things up a bit so I implemented running around my neighborhood paired with some light dumbbell training. Mainly just 15 pound dumbbells and different variations of chest presses, curls, tricep extensions, etc. This got me all the way down to 160 pounds. Now was the time to actually build up muscle and by this point I was 3 years into the process.

So for the last 5 years I've kept the same workouts and have progress. I have been running PHAT (Power Hypertrophy Adaptive Training). It's a 5 day a week workout program that I stuck to religiously and over the past 5 years I can count on both my hands the amount of workouts I actually missed.

Instead of typing out the workout, I used this spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z88d0BCV7jDOyPouLc5TzYjAqY9u_p8ZnTmDkaABACE/edit#gid=0

I have gone through 5 years of bulking and cutting cycles and have finally reached the body I want.

If anyone has any questions about any of my struggles along the way, please reach out and I'll try my hardest to help!

As for diet, it was strictly an IIFYM approach. I did this 100% through calorie counting!!! No BS fad diets or anything. I ate what I wanted, when I wanted, but as long as I was under my caloric goals for the day (around 1600-1800 for cutting, 2800-3000 for bulking) I always saw results.
