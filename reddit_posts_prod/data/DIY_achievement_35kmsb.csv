Not sure if the images made it clear. But I'm referring to the glossy yet smooth kind of finish you see in most modern furniture such as modern kitchen cabinets and bed frames 

I am assuming it's wood with some sort of finish. Although I doubt it's just paint, is it some kind of plastic? or a different material? lamination?

Can I achieve this finish with household equipment or do I have to rely on industrial painting equipment?"
