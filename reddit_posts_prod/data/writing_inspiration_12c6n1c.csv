Writing without inspiration,ZookeepergameOk3879,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/12c6n1c/writing_without_inspiration/,8,2,"Sorry for the vague title, I had trouble trying to think of what to call this post. 

Anyways, I have a lot of trouble sitting down with the intention to write. I usually just kind of wait until inspiration hits me on the head out of nowhere, jot some things down, and revise it later on. The issue is, sometimes, I’ll get ideas but I won’t have enough inspiration to really carry the idea through. When I try to “force” myself to write, the quality of the writing feels cheap (if any words come to mind at all that is), the writing process itself feels excruciating and unentertaining, and I end up abandoning that idea and sticking it in my notes app as I tell myself I’ll revisit it later (even though it’s unlikely that I actually do). 

I want to be able to write without needing strong, immediate inspiration and just work with the ideas I already have. I’m just not 
completely sure how to go about doing that. Because of this tendency of mine, I tend not to write as much as I’d like to, and I want that to change. 

If it’s of any importance, I usually write free verse poetry. Any tips?"
