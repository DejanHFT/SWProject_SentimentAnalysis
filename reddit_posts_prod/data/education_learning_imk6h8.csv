Linguistics Learning Path?,McTwitchWithFries,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/imk6h8/linguistics_learning_path/,2,3,"Hello? After being out of high school for almost 10 years, I'm finally looking into higher education!

My plan is to get an associates of arts, then a BA in English, then, finally, a Masters in Linguistics.

My question, I guess, is whether or not that plan makes sense, or is there a better way to go about it?"
