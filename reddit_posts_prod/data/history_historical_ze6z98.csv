How did new emerging religions succeed despite established pre-existing religions during ancient and/or pre-historic times?,matthewlee0165,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/ze6z98/how_did_new_emerging_religions_succeed_despite/,93,95,"One example would include Christianity. Someone recently told me how unfathomable it seems that Christianity--presumably starting with a mere few dozen disciples--managed to proliferate so rapidly across different languages and cultures (from Rome to Egypt to Iran, etc.) despite facing competition and even persecution from other, previously established religions (such as those in India and the Roman Empire). Could anyone shed light on this? What exactly led to Hinduism being selected over other pre-Vedic religions during its conception? How did newer religions like Christianity grow so quickly and widely?

Thank you in advance!"
