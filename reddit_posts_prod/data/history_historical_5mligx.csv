Does anyone know more about this historical marker?,iampettingacat,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5mligx/does_anyone_know_more_about_this_historical_marker/,50,857,"I am not sure if this is the right subreddit, so please let me know if it is not.

I frequent back roads to look at buildings and historical markers. I was in Dora, IL when I found this one, specifically on Sefton Rd. It isn't a typical sign, and there were no other signs around it describing what it was or that there was even a marker present. The biggest catch about this sign is that all words have been worn off. I have linked to the pictures here: http://historicalmarkings.blogspot.com/  

From browsing other websites, it might be about Thomas Lincoln's farm or another Lincoln family member's farm. However, this sign is not in Coles County where Thomas Lincoln's farm was located. 

If anyone has any information about this marker or ideas about why it could be there,  please let me know!"
