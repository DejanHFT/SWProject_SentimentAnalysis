What is your country's most famous historical battle?,raikion,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/a27ghu/what_is_your_countrys_most_famous_historical/,148,38,In Belgium people still refer to the [battle of the golden spurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Golden_Spurs) sometimes. Imo it's just a cool story about the underdog Flemish farmers defeating the rich French army. This was in a time when the knights were pretty unbeatable but Flemish commanders made use of the terrain and special weapons to get the victory. Soon after this event the French came back and crushed the resistance but we all like to forget that part ;).
