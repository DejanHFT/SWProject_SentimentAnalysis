"7-day Exploration, Ending in London, UK?",Wi538u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/11ylvyg/7day_exploration_ending_in_london_uk/,29,2,"Hopefully this question isn't annoying.

I am from the US, working in London for 4 weeks over the summer, and taking my significant other. Work is willing to fly me pretty much anywhere in Europe a week early and then I need to get myself to London. Partner has explored Italy, and we'll do a long weekend to France during the working month, so I've excluded those countries from the pre-work options.

Any recommendations? Money is not unlimited but not the most important factor either.

It's not much time, so my two initial thoughts are fly to Dublin, Ireland and work my way to London via train/ferry, or else fly to Netherlands/Belgium and then get a cheap-ish flight or the Eurostar to London. We'd love a mix of (non-hardcore) hiking/nature/scenery and culture/museum/dining.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts/ideas.

EDIT for clarification: I'm not supposed to enter the UK early due to visa requirements, so exploring the UK will be on the weekends. This early week needs to be mostly in non-UK countries except \*maybe\* the last day."
