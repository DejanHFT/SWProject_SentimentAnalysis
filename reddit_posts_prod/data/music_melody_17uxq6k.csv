Melody without Words?,MusicDiminished,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/17uxq6k/melody_without_words/,10,19,"I was talking with a coworker about the song ""Don't Stop the Music"" by Rihanna, and he was saying ""I don't know what she says at the end there"", in reference to the part where Rihanna goes ""Mamase Mamasa Mama-msa"" and it got me thinking, is there a term for just singing a melody with sounds instead of words, typically done with ""La Las"" or ""Dat-Das"". Not quite humming or whistling, still singing, but just doing it with sounds instead of the lyrics or any words."
