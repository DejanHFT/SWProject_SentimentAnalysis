"As a Brit, what delicious things should I bring back from Mexico?",mardyoldspinster,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/14vyy2i/as_a_brit_what_delicious_things_should_i_bring/,131,101,"I’m coming up to the end of a delightful holiday in Mexico, and at the end of a stay overseas, I usually like to go to a local supermarket and use up the last of my currency buying interesting and tasty food items I can’t easily get back home. Bearing in mind that we have very few Mexican people living in the UK (and so shops carry few ingredients and almost no imported items- [this](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/shop/browse/groceries/food_cupboard/cooking_sauces_and_meal_kits/mexican_sauces_and_meal_kits) is my local supermarket’s Mexican range, for example), what would you recommend looking out for?

No dietary restrictions, competent cook, not a fussy eater, happy translating instructions on packets, and interested in either ready-to-eat items or something that I can cook with. Only import restriction is that I should stick to relatively processed items rather than raw/fresh ingredients (most things that come in a package tend to be considered fine in my experience, but I’ll check these requirements myself if anything seems risky).

ETA: Thanks for the recs! So far I’ve picked up a few different cans of chipotle peppers, some dried peppers, tajin, drinking chocolate, mole, a tortilla press, achiote paste, vanilla, some interesting seasonings, various types of salsa, cajeta, and lots of drink mixes to try out. I’ve also got some savoury snacks and a big bag of Mexican sweets to bring into work. Still got quite a few pesos to burn, so may go and buy some more things tomorrow morning if anything else comes up."
