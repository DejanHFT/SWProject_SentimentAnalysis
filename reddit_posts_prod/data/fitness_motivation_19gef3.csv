I need help with motivation. Any suggestions?,hellboytd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/19gef3/i_need_help_with_motivation_any_suggestions/,41,7,I'm 19 and am about to hit 200 pounds for the first time in my life. I used to be pretty fit but for the last year or so have watched myself slowly become more and more out of shape. I get spurts of inspiration to go to the gym and lose weight and get back in shape but find easy ways to skip and once that starts I just end up stopping all together. I usually go to the gym with a friend and he has this same problem. Any advice to keep up the motivation? What has worked for you?
