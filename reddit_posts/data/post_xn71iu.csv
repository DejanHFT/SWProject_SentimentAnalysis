Sci-Fi Story Research – how could solar storms knock out alien invaders?,Clumsy_Quokka,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/xn71iu/scifi_story_research_how_could_solar_storms_knock/,18,0,"Hi Space loving people of Reddit :)

Can someone help out an aspiring writer? I'm currently researching for a fantasy/sci-fi story which features an alien race infiltrating Earth by taking over people's bodies. This changes the body chemistry of the former human in many ways, makes them stronger, gives them healing powers etc. However, there's one major weakness: the possessed human bodies become vulnerable to geomagnetic storms, at least if they get Carrington event level intense.

I'd like to be able to at least explain a little bit WHY a body that still appears to be flesh and blood is vulnerable to these disturbances. I'm a lost case when it comes to biology, physics, chemistry, you name it... Tried to research why exactly electric systems (like the telegraph systems in 1859) can be so badly affected by geomagnetic storms while a human body will be just fine – although I have found theories that solar winds can actually negatively influence the health of our human hearts in the long run. Which got me thinking that it might be the alien's hearts that will be their weak spots. I'm thinking that solar storms might actually cause their hearts to stutter or stop completely.

Go wild! It's a fantasy story, ofc it won't be realistic as such but I'd like to offer an in-universe explanation. Thanks in advance!! Let me know if you got any questions or need more info :)
