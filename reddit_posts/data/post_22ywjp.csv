What is the current state of AI-development on the programming level?,FunExplosions,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/22ywjp/what_is_the_current_state_of_aidevelopment_on_the/,4,5,"Not talking about robotics. How far along have people come in creating artificial life in code? In other words: a ""brain"" equivalent.

I'm interested in the field (not in getting *into* the field; just learning about it), but have no idea where to start.

I have very basic programming knowledge, but won't be able to suss out too much jargon beyond what you'd find in a Comp Sci 101 textbook.

also, to the mods: I checked the computing FAQ... and [it's blank](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/computing).

I'm sure this is a very broad question, so, if you know of any specific areas of research within AI-development that I otherwise wouldn't know about, feel free to include them after brow-beating me."
