Why does 10x3 not work as well for bench compared to squat/deadlift?,JonDick13926,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/c133fo/why_does_10x3_not_work_as_well_for_bench_compared/,19,13,"I started using 10x3 to increase strength in deadlift and squat about 6 months ago.  So far, my progression has continuously been like this:

10x3 at Xlbs the first day
10x4 at the same weight the next time

Add 10 lbs, start back over at 10x3 with the new weight.

For deadlifting and squatting this has worked well.  Two months ago I started using this method for benching, except I’d add 5 lbs and not 10lbs at a time.  It worked for about 5-6 weeks.  The last 2-3 weeks I’ve stalled, while the deadlift and squat continues to steadily climb.

My exact issue is this: I’ll bench a certain weight 10x3 no problem.  3-4 days later I’ll bench the same weight 10x4 except the problem is I can only do about 2 or 3 sets of 4 and I’m burned.  I’m guaranteed to totally fail if o push any harder.  What’s the problem?  Why does this technique work so well for squatting and deadlifting but only worked with bench pressing for a little over a month?"
