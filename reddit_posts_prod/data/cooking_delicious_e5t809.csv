"Girl, I like is Vegetarian, what are some delicious recipes I could learn to make for her?",Shocksterr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/e5t809/girl_i_like_is_vegetarian_what_are_some_delicious/,713,959,"As the title says, the girl I like is well a vegetarian and I am not. If we go out sometimes, I usually just order what she is having, to avoid having her watch me eat meat in front of her, and well to be courteous. As most people know, restaurants have not that many things that cater to vegetarians and seeing how we are in high school, I don't think we can afford fancy restaurants. So just wanted to learn how to make some great vegetarians recipes maybe healthy since she eats really healthy. It would be better to just to learn how to cook food for the two of us, instead of going out. I appreciate all the responses!

Edit: Well I think this post is getting a lot of attention, which is good for me :D

I'll respond to each one of your comments in due time. Thanks again guys, appreciate it!

Edit II: You guys are killing me with these replies, I appreciate it but like damn.

Edit III: It's 1 a.m. and I have school in the morning so I will respond to your comments later. Thank you again, but I'm tired from responding from the hundred of comments.

Edit IV: I see a lot of people making comments on my grammar. The comma in the title was unintentional, the ones below in the description were just me being stupid.

Edit V: The last edit, I want to thank everyone for the shit load of recipes and such kind, generous words. I've tried my best to reply to most of your comments but it's proved to be quite difficult. So just wanted to say if I didn't respond to your comment ""Thank You!"""
