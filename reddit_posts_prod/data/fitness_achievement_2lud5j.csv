Ladies who focus on glutes: how long did it take you to achieve the desired results?,ineedprotein,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2lud5j/ladies_who_focus_on_glutes_how_long_did_it_take/,43,24,"Hi all!

I have been working on my glutes diligently for a few months now mostly doing heavy barbell hip thrusts as well as other glute activating exercises.  I am seeing pretty good results so far and run to the mirror almost every morning (not gonna lie haha).  Does anyone else do this and how long did it actually take before you looked in the mirror and felt satisfied?  I get a crazy pump after lifting and love the way it looks.  Hoping one day it will look like that all day.  Thank you! "
