Is a 21 hour layover in Singapore enough to go to the city and explore a bit?,GiantsFan2010,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18s6ya3/is_a_21_hour_layover_in_singapore_enough_to_go_to/,32,2,"I am flying to Singapore for a 21 hour layover, arriving at 7PM or so after a 17hr flight. I anticipate that I will be quite tired so I won't try to do too much that night. I'm flying out at 3:30PM the next afternoon. Is the morning + early afternoon enough time to do anything, or not really? "
