Traveling to Spain to explore the Flamenco Culture,okyesbutno,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/198nxfo/traveling_to_spain_to_explore_the_flamenco_culture/,0,1,"Hello! 

My cousin and I will travel to Spain in late July for two weeks. For 3 - 5 days, we'll visit Seville and Granada to experience the flamenco culture.

1. Does anyone recommend a flamenco club, or what to do specifically to immerse ourselves in that culture? 
2. Additionally, I've been learning flamenco guitar with a teacher. Is it a good idea for me, as a foreigner, to bring my guitar to find  flamenco lessons?"
