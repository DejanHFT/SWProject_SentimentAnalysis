(Be it losing weight, adding muscle, gaining weight, etc.)",The_Aluminum_Monster,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/cbwjn/what_is_your_motivation_for_changing_your_body_be/,68,19,"I am currently 3 weeks into doing weight watchers and have been going to the gym pretty much everyday (i'm 7lbs closer to my goal, yay!). My main and very superficial motivation for wanting to lose weight is to be able to wear cute clothes and look hot... I'm just curious what are the motivations of others who are on the path to changing their bodies. "
