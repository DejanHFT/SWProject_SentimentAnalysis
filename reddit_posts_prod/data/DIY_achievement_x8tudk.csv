Need your help. I'm having trouble figuring out how to achieve this finish on a steel table top.,Azkabandi,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/x8tudk/need_your_help_im_having_trouble_figuring_out_how/,3,0,"The table in [this](https://preview.redd.it/hello-friends-how-do-i-achieve-the-same-finish-as-the-v0-865zgwdmykm91.jpg?auto=webp&s=d4f0606f908fc9b096675e3b18ae37e15b3b9e42) photo is made of untreated mild or carbon steet. It is designed to rust/petina and then the owner can stop further rusting/petina by applying beeswax to the surface. 

Now, I'm doing something similar to this with an 8mm thick blackened steel sheet which I intend to cut into shape. I know the color of blackened steel might differ from the type of carbon steel in the photo linked above but I want to achieve the same surface finish. How can I achieve this not shiny, not brushed and almost satin/matte smooth finish?"
