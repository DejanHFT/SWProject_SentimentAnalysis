Thought you guys might have some advice on a philosophy major,theirishfronttt,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/e79yh/thought_you_guys_might_have_some_advice_on_a/,15,3,"I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's in History, but I've always had an interest in philosophy and have loved the few courses I've taken in it. I am contemplating double majoring in philosophy because I planned to minor in it but the major is just 9 more credits so I figured why not? Would this be a good major combination that would have a later effect on job opportunities or would you not recommend a philosophy degree unless I plan on going for a high level like PhD? (eventually I would like to get my masters if that would be recommended)"
