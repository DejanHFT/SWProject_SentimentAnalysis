What's the difference between being supportive and a doormat for your partner's stress?,bratschisten,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lct55d/whats_the_difference_between_being_supportive_and/,5,23,"I (18F) have been with my boyfriend (19yo) for almost three months and though we are already very close, our relationship is still quite young. I try very hard to be the supportive GF, and I really want to be, but I have to admit it's tiring when my boyfriend is stressed and upset almost all the time. He's going through a bit of a crisis of what he wants to do in school and in life, and it's consumed him for the past month or so. I feel like the bulk of our conversations now always come back to how much he's annoyed with or unmotivated in school and how upset he is about being stuck in a program that he doesn't want to be in, etc. Frankly, it zaps the fun out of a lot of our interactions.

Frustratingly, he also often refuses to handle his emotions in a mature way. He'll whine and complain to me, and when I try to comfort him or give him advice, he shoots me down at every corner with nihilistic declarations about how he's never gonna get a job anyway, or he's screwed, etc, instead of listening to me and at least trying to engage with what I'm saying in good faith. It's especially frustrating that when I've called him out for his behavior, he says ""you should break up with me.""

He so easily gets defeated and unmotivated and doesn't know how to crawl out of those moods, and he's aware it's an issue but seems content to just let it be. I really don't want to break up with him; I care for him a lot, and he's genuinely a great guy who makes me laugh and smile a lot, and he's really good to me, but when he gets in these moods so often I just feel so dragged down.

Is it cruel for me to want him to be able to compartmentalize his stress better? I want to be here for him and support him, but this feels like more than that. It's not just an every-now-and-then thing, it's like almost every day. He's seeing a councilor tomorrow, and I hope that will help a bit, but I don't know how to feel about our relationship right now.

TL;DR: Boyfriend is stressed so often and doesn't know how to compartmentalize, and I feel very dragged down by his constant low moods. Am I being supportive by listening or getting used as an emotional mop?"
