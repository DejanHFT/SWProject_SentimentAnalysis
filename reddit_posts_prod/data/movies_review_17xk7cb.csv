* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wish_2023) 50% (101 Reviews)

>Wish earns some tugs at the heartstrings with the way it warmly references many of the studio's classics, but nostalgia's no substitute for genuine storytelling magic -- no matter how beautifully animated it might be.

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/wish-review-disney-ariana-debose-chris-pine-1235648321/):

>Even during its more successful moments, Wish’s magic falls flat. The film is weighed down by its purpose: to revel in Disney nostalgia while soaring into the future.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/wish-review-disney-ariana-debose-chris-pine-1235792825/):

>The strategy behind “Wish” seems to be: If we do an homage to enchantment, the audience will be enchanted. True magic, however, can’t be recycled.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2023/11/wish-review-ariana-debose-shines-chris-pine-disney-fairytale-animation-1235614133/) 

>To cap 100 years with a few throwaway quips about Bambi, Mary Poppins, and Peter Pan (plus a whole rollcall of more recent characters during the end credits) seems to be a hell of a disappointing way to capitalize on such a formidable back catalogue.


[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/11/17/wish-disney-movie-review/71606175007/) (3/4):

>Even for hardcore fans, Wish comes close to overdoing it with the, well, Disney-ness. That’s when Oscar winner Ariana DeBose (“West Side Story”) becomes the movie’s saving grace, as a likable, idealistic teen heroine with plucky verve and powerhouse vocals.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/wish-movie-review-disney-musical-1234925838/) (B-):

>As Disney celebrates its 100th year, “Wish” serves as a throwback to the past, a celebration of the present, and a gentle push into the future.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/wish-movie-review-disney-ariana-debose/):

>Wish is a darling film with fantastic music and amazing voice performances, but the story does feel a bit like a house of cards waiting to be poked.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/wish-review/) (3/5):

>Ravishingly pretty but low-powered, this cute and earnest fairy tale has a whole lot of homage, but not enough heart.

[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/wish-review-disney-release-date-b2449335.html) (3/5):

>Wish, clearly, has been made with care, but as its credits offer a whistle-stop tour through Disney’s history, it’s hard not to think – god, wasn’t it great when they made stuff as weird and fun and daring as, say, The Emperor’s New Groove?

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/wish/) (3/5)

>An appropriate tribute to Disney, by itself. It hardly breaks any ground — it’s simply there to celebrate the ground the studio was built on.

[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/wish-review-disney/) (2/5):

>Disney's centenary animation feels like an attempt, after a wobbly decade, to return the brand to first principles – but it doesn't come off.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/wish-review-disney-animation) (5/10):

>Wish’s visually appealing celebration of Disney’s 100th anniversary mostly lacks inventiveness and gravitas but features some memorable music.

[Slashfilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1448566/wish-review/) (3.5/10):

>Though this film is well-intentioned, fleetly paced, and boasts a unique blend of animation, it's a desperate and sweaty attempt to revive the past glories of the studio.
