What’s your favorite literary insult?,svarkoperc,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pos0b9/whats_your_favorite_literary_insult/,93,200,"I was reading Proust last night and stumbled across this one:

“You are a formless water that will trickle down any slope that offers itself, a fish devoid of memory, incapable of thought, which all its life long in the aquarium will continue to dash itself a hundred times a day against a glass wall, always mistaking it for water.”

Now that’s a classy insult."
