Lord Henry is one of the most underrated literary villains of all time,TyrionLannister557,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/swbqep/lord_henry_is_one_of_the_most_underrated_literary/,67,976,"I'm finished reading ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and it occurs to me how much of an amazing villain Lord Henry is.

To start off, he is a hedonist who sticks to his beliefs on how to ""satisfy one's senses is to satisfy one's soul"" and vice-versa. He spends the books manipulating Dorian into becoming just as terrible as a person as he is, and all the characters who know Henry recognize that he is a horrible person with his beliefs on hedonism and love, but they still hang out with him due to how interesting and compelling he is.  He does show some level of compassion to Dorian, but at the same time is still being an asshole like when he convince Dorian that he should not blame himself for Sybil Vane's death and that her death was her own actions.

The best part about it all is that Henry ultimately KNOWS he's a terrible person, but just doesn't care. As long as he's living to the fullest of his life in his beliefs on hedonism, he doesn't care whom he hurts.

In short, even though Dorian is one of the pioneers for protagonist villains, Lord Henry is a more compelling villain because he is a charismatic hedonist who sticks to his beliefs and doesn't care if he's being a horrible person. Best part is that he doesn’t need a backstory to justify his shit. He’s like the Joker: he does it for fun.

Edit: I never said Picture of Dorian Gray as underrated. I said that Henry, as a villain, is underrated and should be given more credit. Also, Henry was definitely manipulating Dorian on purpose; his conversations with Basil in the beginning literally implied that he’s done it before and that’s why he wanted to keep him away from Dorian."
