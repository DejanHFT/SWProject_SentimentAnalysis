Review Thread - 'Midsommar',BunyipPouch,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/c2nvdj/review_thread_midsommar/,395,569,"The review embargo dropped today for A24's folk-horror *Midsommar* and they're looking very good so far. It's directed by Ari Aster, who directed *Hereditary* last year. This isn't getting quite the acclaim that *Hereditary* did, but still sounding like a great follow-up.

> More unsettling than frightening, it's still a trip worth taking. 

[Variety](https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/midsommar-film-review-1203247188/)

> Once the real fireworks start to ignite, you realize how powerfully the film's themes resonate when they're given room to breathe. It's just a shame it takes so long to bring them into focus.

[Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/midsommar-review?verso=true)

> Midsommar is a shocking piece of filmmaking—unnervingly competent even when the film yaws into silliness, even when it risks tedium. This film will alienate a lot of people (much like Hereditary, its audience exit polling is likely going to be abysmal), but there’s a wonderfully audacious confidence to the way Midsommar is built. 

[Bloody Disgusting](https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3568215/review-ari-asters-midsommar-gorgeous-emotionally-overwhelming-mixed-bag/)

> An intermittently impressive and frustrating film, but worth watching for every single one of its flaws.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/06/midsommar-review-1202151115/) 

> What a blast to watch this emerging auteur mess around. This is the kind of mad science filmmaking worth rooting for: Aster refashions “The Wicker Man” as a perverse breakup movie, douses Swedish mythology in Bergmanesque despair, and sets the epic collage ablaze. He may not land every big swing, but the underlying vision is hard to shake even when it falters.

[The Playlist](https://theplaylist.net/midsommar-review-ari-aster-20190619/) 

> Admirable, ambitious and impressive, but ultimately aloof, Midsommar has its delights for sure, but it lacks the emotional depth to match the sharp insights it has into the evils of the ambivalent, wishy-washy relationship (run as fast as you can).

[Screen International](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/midsommar-review/5140496.article)

> Aster’s bold flourishes occasionally fall flat, but Florence Pugh holds the film together — especially when its plotting stumbles or its shocks grow predictable. Read full review
