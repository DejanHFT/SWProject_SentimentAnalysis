I finally made delicious zucchini soup!,thisothernameth,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/17w3eue/i_finally_made_delicious_zucchini_soup/,1,2,"Recently I asked this community how to make a good creamy veggie soup, as I officially suck at making them. I followed the advice I received and used the following methods to make a zucchini soup that was surprisingly good.

2 medium zucchini, cut in half
1 onion, cut in quarters
2 garlic cloves, halfed and stem removed
little olive oil
vegetable broth
salt
pepper
nutmeg

Roughly slice the vegetables. 

Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt, roast in the oven under the grill for about 20min until slightly charred (make sure the garlic doesn't burn - I covered it with the zucchini half way through).

Add some broth and blend everything until smooth. Add more broth to reach the desired consistency. 

Add salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste.

Note: roasting the veggies and adding garlic really made turned this simple soup into delicious dinner. 

Looking forward to giving a try to the other advice I received."
