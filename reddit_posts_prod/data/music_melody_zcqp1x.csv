Fast paced exciting songs with frequent high pitch tunes and melodies,Free_Significance267,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/zcqp1x/fast_paced_exciting_songs_with_frequent_high/,5,3,"Hey, I’m not really expert in music, so I don’t know if there is a specific type of music for what I want or not. I do my best to describe what is on my mind. 

I listened to this song “middle of the night” by Elley Duhe and the high pitches and vocal runs really got me. 

Some examples with similarities:
“Battle scars “ by Guy sebastian
“Stereo hearts” by Adam Levine
“Champion “ by Carrie Underwood
Maybe “set fire the rain” by Adele. 

So my questions are
1. Is this a specific type of music? I read somewhere some called ballad but im not sure if it exactly fits what i have in mind. 

2. Can you give some good similar suggestions. 
Thanks"
