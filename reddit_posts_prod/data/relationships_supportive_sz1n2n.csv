My husband isn’t supportive and seems dismissive of my ideas… help?,puppywiggles,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/sz1n2n/my_husband_isnt_supportive_and_seems_dismissive/,1,1,"Me: 31 F
Husband: 31M
married for nearly 3 years

I recently was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, and adhd. And since then I’ve been trying to figure myself out because specifically with adhd it’s silently wreaked havoc on my life and self confidence my whole life. I have anyways struggled with hyper-fixation and follow through/completing projects.  Obviously during covid that increased but it rarely affects him and is contained to my office. 

My issue is I feel like he doesn’t respect my ideas because of that? And is constantly making comments insinuating I’m not capable of completing a project successfully. One was just an idea for an art wall, I was admittedly in a Harry Potter fixation period (there are a few subjects that have stayed constant but every once in a while I’ll come back to them and be super into it for a few weeks/months) and I had the idea to commission pieces of art from various artists over several years and basically finding artists that can choose an art medium that matches the character and eventually having an eclectic wall of original art… I told him about this the same week I started mood stabilizers for bipolar and he didn’t say anything after I very excitedly told him my idea. So I asked if he thought it was a good idea… and he responded “why don’t you wait for your new meds to kick in before you decide if it’s a good idea” 

This was months ago and I tried several times to explain why that was hurtful and he never really agreed. 

Now I’m working on a business plan for an idea I’ve had for a long time and I really want to try to do it and give it a serious try… and I haven’t told him about it because I didn’t want him to squash it before I could have a chance to try… 

but I just sat down with my notebook and started working on my plan and he asked what I was doing and I told him I wasn’t ready to share it unless he was ready to listen with an open mind and he was like is it gonna cost me money? Or make more work for me? And I said no and this is why I didn’t want to tell you about it yet… and he goes why? You’re not going to do it anyway. 

And just like that I feel crushed before I’ve begun.

There are more examples and these are on the extreme end, it’s usually more subtle comments but it’s very clear he doesn’t have faith in me ever being successful… and I’m struggling a lot because when I bring it up he talks in circles or gets really defensive like he can’t believe I’m accusing him of being disrespectful. I know I have issues with follow through but idk how can I work on that if I don’t try things? I don’t know what I should do in order to prove myself I guess? Or prove that I’m capable? Maybe if I went back and completed old projects? How do I get him to take me seriously? I feel like I’m letting his doubt in me limit what I do and I don’t wanna do that. 

I do also work full time so It’s not like I just run through money/projects without contributing.

TL:DR husband makes comments making me feel like I’m not capable of success, how do I prove myself so he will take me seriously?"
