Who is your favorite literary character?,ashthundercrow,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tl3ulq/who_is_your_favorite_literary_character/,104,21,"Straight-forward question here. No bells nor whistles.  


For the longest time, my answer to this question would've been The Jester from King Lear. However, I just finished reading *Our Mutual Friend* by the Late Great Dickens and now I think my new favorite character is Ms. Wren/Doll's Dressmaker.   


Many of Dickens' characters would be ripe for the picking, to be fair. The man knew how to write memorable characters, no matter their likeability status."
