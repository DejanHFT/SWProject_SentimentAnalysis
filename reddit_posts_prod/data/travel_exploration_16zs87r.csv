Neighborhoods to walk around and explore in London?,AlbiMappaMundi,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16zs87r/neighborhoods_to_walk_around_and_explore_in_london/,25,19,"Headed to London in a few weeks; have traveled there a number of times before for both work and fun. So it's definitely not a ""hit all of the tourist sites"" kind of trip, have been to many of the notable places like Westminster Abbey, the Tower of London, British Museum, etc. 

Our thought was to each day, pick a neighborhood or part of the city that we might not otherwise have visited, and spend the bulk of the day just walking around and getting a feel for the local vibes.

The question is: what neighborhoods or areas would people recommend? The only one I have firmly on my agenda is Greenwich (have never been over there before). "
