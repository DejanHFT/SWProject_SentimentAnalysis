My mom(44F) got engaged this weekend and I(24F) want to be supportive but I don't know how to handle it,engagedmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5lhyuf/my_mom44f_got_engaged_this_weekend_and_i24f_want/,40,132,"My mom got engaged to a WONDERFUL man this weekend after dating for about 9 months. She and my dad have been amicably divorced for 13 years and both my parents, my brother(14) and I still do things together regularly and we all still live in the same town. However my mom just got a job in a town 2 hours away, where her fiance lives and she and my brother are getting ready to move there in about a week. Basically a lot of things are changing in my family.

The problem I am having is I don't know how I am going to handle my mom being engaged and getting married. My boyfriend and I have been together since high school and are getting ready to celebrate 6 years together. For the past 2 years we have thoroughly discussed marriage, engagement and what we want out of a life together. This past month things have been a little tense because it's engagement season and he knows how much I want to get married to him and how much it would mean to me. He wants to get married too and says engaged couples are ""lucky"" but thinks it's bad timing for us to get engaged. A few weeks ago my coworker's daughter got engaged and it has been nothing but wedding talk. When this comes up I feel very hurt and I actually had to leave one day and take a 5 to calm myself down and have a short little cry. My plan to survive this is to avoid them when they are doing wedding talk. I feel silly and stupid that someone I don't even know getting engaged can make me feel this way. 

But now that my mom is engaged I don't know how I'm going to handle it because I can't just hide and ignore it. My mom and I are have a good relationship and I'm pretty sure she'll want me in the wedding and helping with planning. We also live in a small town and interact with a lot of the same people and I don't know how to put on a happy face or what to say when literally just thinking about her being engaged, let along taking about it, makes me cry. I am happy for my mom and I know they are a great couple, but I don't know how to show this and be supportive when I can't even talk about it. I've considered telling her pretty much, ""I am happy for you but this is a very painful time for me."" but I don't want her to worry about me or make her engagement and special day about me. I also don't want people knowing the private details of my relationship and if people know my boyfriend and I are having a hard time with this, they will talk and speculate.

tl;dr: My mom got engaged to a wonderful man after a short relationship, where as my boyfriend and I have been together almost 6 years and still aren't engaged. I am happy for her but just the thought of her being engaged hurts and makes me cry every time. I don't know how to face the community and family and be supportive when all I want to do is hide and I literally can't talk about it.

EDIT: I've seen this come up a few times in the comments so: Boyfriend and I have already decided we would elope and have this priced out. It would be about $1,300. Has asked me how long I would need to plan this and I have told him 3 months.We have considered having a reception 6 months afterwards but we're not big into being the center of attention and like to keep things low key.
