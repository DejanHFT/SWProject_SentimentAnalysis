Did medieval peasants actually use coins?,buffaloinahedge,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/fgi2k1/did_medieval_peasants_actually_use_coins/,32,142,"If you were a peasant working the land in 13th to 15th century England, would you use coins as currency on a regular basis? Or was it a purely barter economy among a village-like community? How would they pay taxes if it was necessary?

Also, maybe not entirely related but if these things were made of precious metals, what's to stop someone from starting their own mine and causing massive inflation?

edit: thanks so much to everyone who answered :), really insightful and intriguing; i'll definitely be having a look at the book recommendations."
