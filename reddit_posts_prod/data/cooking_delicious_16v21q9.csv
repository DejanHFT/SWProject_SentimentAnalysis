I made up my own recipe tonight and it was delicious.,hammformomma,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/16v21q9/i_made_up_my_own_recipe_tonight_and_it_was/,43,94,"I made jalapeño popper chicken pasta tonight, from my own head, and it was delicious. I feel really proud of myself and I just wanted to share.   


Okay, since so many were interested and I'm super flattered, I am adding what I did. I cut up three slices of bacon and crisped those up in a pan, removed when done. Used the fat for a roux with about a tablespoon or so of flour. Added in maybe 1/3 to 1/2 cup of milk and brought it up to bubbling. Then I added in some cheddar cheese, which I measured with my heart, and about 4 oz of cream cheese. Stirred all that together and threw in some jarred sliced jalapeños. While working on that, I was boiling my linguine and had a chicken breast that I split (just butterflyed but all the way through so it was two separate pieces) in the air fryer, 370 for 13 minutes, seasoned with salt and pepper. When the pasta was done I threw it in the sauce to toss, cut up my chicken and put it on top with my bacon and bam, dinner."
