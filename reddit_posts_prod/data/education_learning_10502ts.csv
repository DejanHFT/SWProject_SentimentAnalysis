Why aren't students curious to learn anymore?,TheoneandonlyWeird,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/10502ts/why_arent_students_curious_to_learn_anymore/,13,3,"I'm not sure if anyne has even noticed, but you rarely find any students who are intrested in to involve into lessons and actually learn. Personally Im curious to find out everything, but yet rarely you will find that curiosity in other pupils. Example- If you had went to a kindergardner and told them to ask you a question, there would be millions and they are honestly are excited to learn. Yet in a different suitwation, if you went to a 10th grader you wouldn't get much out of them, since of the exhuasting of school and always being worried about other stuff. I personally think that alot of students now don't have that curisoity anymore to adventure, exoplore and even learn anymore because of school is always viewed as a negative idea and you're constantly shuving information to the piont they're not even intrested anymore. I can understand how students need to learn this thing or that as a general thing (such as reading, writting e.g) but what is stopping us to make these lessons enjoyable for pupils and for them to gain a passion for learning, instead of constantly cramping them with more information then they can handle at once."
