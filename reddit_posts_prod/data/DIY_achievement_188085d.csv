DIY - Coaching and Consulting,PrestigiousSharnee,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/188085d/diy_coaching_and_consulting/,5,1,"Is there such as service where a person can have  DIY project in mind, and can have a local/online expert provide step-by-step instructions on how to achieve the DIY Project catered for the situation at hand?

Let's say for example I want to install a DIY ductless in a room. This service would provide.

1. Material list and suggestions appropriate for the room heating/cooling wise and planning the layout where to set the ductless vent.
2. Provide step-by-step instructions on drilling, cutting, sealing holes etc.
3. Suggestions on where to use a professional (electrical for example and connection to breaker box).
4. If problems arise, can contact this person via video chat, pictures/text, call.

I think this would be a pretty cool service to start with those who are interested in starting an online DIY consulting service. It's gonna be cooler when Augmented Reality with glasses can provide HUD too.

Just future thinking. "
