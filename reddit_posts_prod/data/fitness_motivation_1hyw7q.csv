"Ladies, how do you motivate yourself to go to the gym when it's that time of the month? Sorry men, just looking for tips.",SrirachaChan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1hyw7q/ladies_how_do_you_motivate_yourself_to_go_to_the/,370,409,"Naturally, I am a lazy person. My laziness never stops me from going to the gym, except when it's ""that time"". I also suffer from having an inner fat girl live in my body, who constantly craves Oreos. So when I am menstruating, it takes literally all of my willpower to say no and go to the gym. I know it is a mental thing, but sometimes my hormones are just wacky for the week and Oreos for breakfast sound better than squats and burpees. Any helpful hints?

Edit: I should let you all know that I still maintain my work outs. Yesterday I skipped the gym, but ran 3 miles and did P90X ab workout. It's more of the up and at em routine at 7am that gets hard to maintain during this week."
