Reading Recommendations for Film Critiquing and Analyzing?,mistuhvuvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/lil91q/reading_recommendations_for_film_critiquing_and/,2,1,"I've been writing film reviews for about the last five years or so starting on Facebook for friends to read and ending up writing more on Letterboxd. For privacy reasons I'd rather not post my account at the moment. Either way, I feel like my ability with writing reviews and stuff have become more or less stangent where I find myself struggling to write even a paragraph and a half on a movie I had just seen. 

Because of that, I'm probably going to take a break from writing reviews for a bit but I do want to use this time to read up on what goes through a critic's head when they're watching a movie. I like to talk about what goes on behind the scenes with the movie such as the cinematography, editing, etc. for the movie.

So, yeah. I'd just love some recommendations on how to review movies better. Thanks!"
