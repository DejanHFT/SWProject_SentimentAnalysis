Can you help me with this Melody?,Letyourselfjoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/11hz7tp/can_you_help_me_with_this_melody/,0,1,"Hello music community! 

For months, I have been trying to figure out why this song sounds so familiar to me. Not the lyrics, but the notes she sings and the overall beat/melody. I’ve had people say Abba, but I’m not so sure. Can you help identify what this is from? 

The song is Julio Iglesias by Rigoberta Bandini."
