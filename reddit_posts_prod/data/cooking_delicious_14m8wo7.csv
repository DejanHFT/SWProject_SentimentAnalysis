"I need to cook more. Beginner-friendly, delicious meals?",SecretSquirrel2598,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/14m8wo7/i_need_to_cook_more_beginnerfriendly_delicious/,15,9,"Hey all! I’d like to get more involved in cooking in order to save money and be more aware of what I’m putting into my body. I’ve done some basic stuff, like pan-frying chicken, quesadillas, eggs, and stir fry. As you can see, my skills are very limited. 

Does anyone have any beginner-friendly meals that you suggest? My kitchen arsenal is small considering I hardly ever cook, but I have the basic essentials. Im open to any kind of dish as long it’s not too difficult. Thanks in advance!"
