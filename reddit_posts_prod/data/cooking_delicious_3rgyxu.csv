I want to make my coworkers something delicious that isn't a baked good.,Boludita,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/3rgyxu/i_want_to_make_my_coworkers_something_delicious/,108,193,"Before you give me any advice about baking for the office-- this isn't that kind of job, and trust me, after the past few days, these people deserve it :) 

Basically, I'm horrible at baking but I enjoy cooking and have been told by 1 or 2 people that I'm somewhat decent at it. I would like to cook something for my coworkers that:

--Isn't too messy (maybe a napkin required, no utensils/plates involved)
--Can be devoured in 1-2 minutes (we have no breakroom, just a small area, and very little time to be there)

--Is delicious

Work or time involved is not an issue. Skill level... I would say intermediate. If it's challenging, post it anyway, and I'll be the judge. 

Thanks in advance...

Edit: I love this sub! Thanks for all the great ideas-- looks like my coworkers are pretty lucky because I am going to try an assortment of these.
