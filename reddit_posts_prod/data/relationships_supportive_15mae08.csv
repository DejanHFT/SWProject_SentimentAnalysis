"I [F26] need an advice about my bf [M29], who I think lacks empathy and isnt supportive",Confident-Cupcake552,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15mae08/i_f26_need_an_advice_about_my_bf_m29_who_i_think/,4,1,"I have been for \~1 year with my bf.He is smart, funny, romantic, always finds time for me, plans nice dates, has tons of friends, motivates me, we have great sex and he gives me nice compliments compliments and always fights for us.

However, I am thinking every week about whether he is a good person and whether we should break up. The reason is, it seems like he has different values, lacks empathy and is a bit selfish. **Some examples:**

**1)** I was in a bad state one day when my bf had a party planned. We had a fight, I cried a lot and got this weird state where I couldnt breathe and couldnt stop crying. He asked if he should stay with me home. But he made some comments earlier that I always cry when he wants to go out or that he has his hands tied with me. So I was afraid to ask for help and he left for the party. Later I got a panic attack and was taken to hospital.

Later we discussed that and my bf said that he wanted to go to the party because he needed to talk to his friends who he doesnt see that often. And that he also was in bad state and needed to talk to someone and that I dont take that into account. I feel like he doesnt want to put me first.

**2)** He asked if we will have sex later, I said ""we will see"" and he responded that it is mean and what if he said that ""he will see if he supports me next time I suffer."" It was after the hospital accident. I think it is stupid to put as equal having sex with someone and supporting someone who is hurting. He keeps saying it was a joke or he just tried to point out that ""we will see"" sounds mean to him.

**3)** We have open relationship and are both very sexual and open-minded, but I feel like my bf is very pushy about sex. From the beginning, he was pushing into the open relationship and when I wanted to go slow and just experiment, he made comments about me not wanting the open relationship at all in fact. Which isnt true, but I hate how he rushes into it and I feel like my feelings dont matter.

There are many more little examples like that. I feel like it is a gray zone and I cant tell whether it is very serious or I am just overthinking it. Also, I had a bf before for two years, who was very empathetic and supportive. E.g. he frequently cared about my wellbeing, told me to work less and take a rest, asked me how I feel etc. My current bf doesnt seem to be that attentive about my happiness. So that comparison also doesnt help.What should I do in your opinion? Am I too needy in the relationship or having too high standards? Or is it okay that I am bothered by this?Thank you for your view.

TL;DR: My bf acts selfish and like he doesnt have empathy or doesnt care about me and my wellbeing. I dont know if I am overreacting or not, because otherwise he is great."
