Most delicious dish with brussel sprouts?,Towerbound,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/17r4hgq/most_delicious_dish_with_brussel_sprouts/,56,16,"Hi r/cooking!  
I love reading this sub for inspiration!  


Here's a challenge: I h8 Brussel sprouts, but I have a bag that needs to be used.   
How would you prepare them if you had to sell me on them?  
I'm not a super experienced cook, but I do enjoy trying new things, so best if its not too complicated.  


Thank you!
