Any advice on how to best finish the conversion of this old chicken coop to a swing arbor,Sufficient-Anybody77,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17sc4vz,1,7,"Need advice on how to finish the conversion of this chicken coop to a swing arbor. The last pic is pretty much what Iâ€™m trying to achieve. 

I started a project to convert our chick coop to a swing arbor that will overlook our land / creek. I would like to stain the columns but not sure where to start. Any advice is greatly appreciated. 

How should I strip and stain? Or do I wrap? 
Do I need additional 2x4 or 4x4 for mounting the swing? 
What am I forgetting?

Thank you!"
