"I feel I get no support, she feels like she's walking on eggshells",Inevitable-Dingo7657,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17ihe2r/i_feel_i_get_no_support_she_feels_like_shes/,167,521,"**TL:DR**   
I (35M) feel like I get no help around the house, and she's (29F) always unprepared and rushing. She (rightly) says little things set me off and she's walking on eggshells.  


I'm (35M) not sure if this latest heated discussion is the end of my relationship with my girlfriend (29F), but either way, I don't want to make anyone feel like they're walking on eggshells again.

She says she doesn't know what little thing will set me off, and that it can be multiple times throughout the day. I said I wasn't mad today, but I guess I was a bit frustrated, and that's enough to make her feel uncomfortable, so I understand that.

Let me give today as an example. We're going out to an event for her work (she's self-employed). It starts at 11. It's 10:30 and she's still not ready, and so I start to remind her we're going to be late. Now to be fair, it doesn't really matter if we're late, but she's always late. We've missed trains, we've had to run to catch planes. It really stresses me out. Yesterday she went to this event on her own (I was working), and she forgot to take a couple of things. I asked why, and she said because she was rushing. She's just always rushing and late, and I really care about being punctual.

So we're at the event, and she opens this suitcase we took, vertically, so everything falls out. I asked ""Why did you open it like that?"", which I appreciate wasn't helpful or nice.

And then later when we get home, we order takeout. It arrives so I go to get cutlery. There is no clean cutlery. The cutlery hadn't been washed since I cooked 3 days ago. And this is another common occurrence. I cook, I clean...and I just feel like I get no support. I tell her this, again, and the heated conversation starts.

So that's three things today.

We had this same conversation a month or 2 ago, and we agreed that I would stop cleaning the bathroom, since I do the cooking, the cleaning, the laundry, the floors...2 months later, the bathroom has never been cleaned.

I appreciate that it seems like little things set me off. And they do. But it's the constant little things. The dishes are never done unless I do them. If I don't cook, we have to order takeout. The bathroom is starting to get gross, and it's me that has to do it.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to be like this. I wish I was more carefree. I don't care if the dishes aren't done. I do care that they're never done. Am I really in the wrong here? How do I make sure I don't make someone feel like they're walking on eggshells?

I also want to point out that I have a full-time job. She has been trying to set up a small brand for the last year. It's going very slowly. I honestly feel that because she's at home all day, she could help out with housework more. I work long hours and I still come home and do stuff around the house. She does not work long hours, or really long enough hours to set up a brand, and I still feel like I get zero support. She argues that she does do stuff, and she does. But it's as and when she remembers"
