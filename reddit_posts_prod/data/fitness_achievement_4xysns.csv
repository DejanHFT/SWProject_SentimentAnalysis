Fitness LPT request. How do you avoid dropping off your regime after achieving your goals?,steals-from-kids,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4xysns/fitness_lpt_request_how_do_you_avoid_dropping_off/,35,33,"So it turns out I don't mind running. I don't enjoy it. But it's not the worst thing in the world. After training for and completing a 5k fun run with a buddy, I find my motivation lacking. Because during my training that was my goal. I'm struggling to find another goal that I can commit to with the same dedication. And shin splints mean that I can't use running to fall back on regularly.  What are some tips for motivating myself to keep up the good behaviour?

Edit: Thanks for your suggestions thus far. I'll find the one-half works best for me, surely."
