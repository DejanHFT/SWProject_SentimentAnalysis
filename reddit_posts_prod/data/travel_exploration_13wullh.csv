"Am I exploring Boston wrong, or is it actually awful?",Annual_Ad_1536,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/13wullh/am_i_exploring_boston_wrong_or_is_it_actually/,7,0,"I was in Boston recently. I have visited small neighborhoods before, sometimes while it was snowing, and that made me think it was a beautiful, interesting place. However, on this recent visit I got to see a lot of it without snow on a weekend. I went from brookline, south towards Jamaica hill, to Southie (just the northern most tip) and downtown as well as the most popular parts of Cambridge.

The city was almost completely empty on a Saturday night. It was eerie. The occasional rove of people shuttling in and out of bars, but there was no actual reason to go into the bars themselves. Everyone in them looked very bored, there was hardly music or an ambiance. The bar tenders pretty much looked like they were ready to challenge a random patron to tic tac toe.

There were some interesting places, some libraries were pretty cool, but for the most part its kind of like someone took a town in Pennsylvania or Jersey and scaled it up to the size of San Fran. I was so confused that I asked someone what was going on, and they mentioned that this isn't really a ""nightlife"" town. Does everyone just go to secret parties at the mason lodges? I can't see how someone would be convinced to pay over $1000 in rent to live there. And yes, I get that there's more to a city than it's nightlife, but that tends to correlate strongly with whether there is an active social scene in general.

What was even stranger is that everyone that I met over the weekend had a great personality. It's much friendlier than I thought it would be, so it's very surprising that they all just kind of stay home and do their own things."
