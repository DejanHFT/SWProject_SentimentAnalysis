I've been writing my novel for two months now, almost half of the work is done. I finished half of my outlining, I'm almost at 30k words, the plot is going good, I have ideas, but my problem is I don't feel inspired to continue. I have the plot stuck in my mind, I know what I have to do in order to write the next scene but I just don't feel like doing it? It may be a lack of motivation because the story is good, I've worked really hard on the plot and I like it but now that I'm in the middle of it, I suddenly don't feel any insperation to write at all. I tried to take a break and read but I felt too distracted and couldn't sit down with a book, I tried to do something different, focus more on my studies, go out with friends but still no insperation at all. Need a little help here :)"
