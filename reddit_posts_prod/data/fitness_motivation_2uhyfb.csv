How can I become motivated to go to the gym after working long hours?,GGInfinitus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2uhyfb/how_can_i_become_motivated_to_go_to_the_gym_after/,280,113,"My partner and I are looking to start down the route of getting into shape and starting a healthly lifestyle, my question is since i work in an office after a 9+ hour shift, all I feel like doing is going home and chilling out. Is there anything you peeps have found as an effective way to motivate yourself to go to the gym after a long day?

Also kind of related is, if you do work in an office as well what are you doing to avoid eating junk food/snacking as again i find that to be one of my downfalls.

Many thanks in advance!"
