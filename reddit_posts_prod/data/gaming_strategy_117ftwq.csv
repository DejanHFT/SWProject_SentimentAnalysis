Let's Discuss Our Favorite Strategy Games!,rizve_ahamed,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/117ftwq/lets_discuss_our_favorite_strategy_games/,2,3,"Hey everyone!

I've been a big fan of strategy games for as long as I can remember, and I'm always looking for new recommendations to add to my collection. That's why I thought it would be fun to start a discussion about our favorite strategy games.

Personally, I'm a big fan of Civilization VI, but I'm also really enjoying the Age of Empires 4 beta. What are your favorite strategy games, and what do you love about them? Do you prefer turn-based or real-time strategy, and why?

I'm excited to hear your thoughts and recommendations. Here are a few discussion questions to get us started:

1. What are your top three favorite strategy games, and why?
2. Do you prefer playing against the computer or other players?
3. What makes a strategy game great in your opinion?

Can't wait to hear from you all!"
