Please help me plan 6-month adventure+solace after residency,ThistlebeeMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/13ghdkk/please_help_me_plan_6month_adventuresolace_after/,38,15,"I have been working really hard for 12+ years to finish my formal medical training which is finally ending. My partner and I are both really burned out and sorely need a break, so we have decided to take at least 6 months off after getting married to travel together, prioritize our connection and relationship, rest, and decide what's next in life.

**The biggest gift would be to hear from you about those places you think about years later that you wished you could have stayed longer, the little local nooks you found on your journeys that were the highlights of your trip, the local celebrations you were part of, and the places that brought you a lot of joy, peace, deep rest, in which it felt safe to release grief, and/or that you experienced as sacred**. Bonus if any connection to healers/people working within integrative health-related fields around the world.

We are flexible, go-with-the-flow, mostly plant-based people. We enjoy adventure, connecting with nature and Spirit, learning about medicinal plants, sharing meaningful conversation with others, and moving our bodies through dance or activities like hiking.

We depart from Portland, Oregon in November 2023 and we are willing to go (nearly) anywhere.

Edit: Likely would focus efforts internationally and wouldn't mind going Southern hemisphere to start then making our way North. Also would like to start by spending a longer period of time in 1 place to decompress (\~1 month) then move a little more quickly (\~every 1-2 weeks) leaving space for spontaneity.

So much gratitude for your ideas and contributions!"
