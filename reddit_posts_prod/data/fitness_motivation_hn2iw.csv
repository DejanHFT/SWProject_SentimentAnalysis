What do you use as a motivational method?,XtcWorkout,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/hn2iw/what_do_you_use_as_a_motivational_method/,66,16,"I used to really be into fitness and worked out everyday, I even went through the p90x program once in full. However since then I was overwhelmed with school and work and just random things affecting my daily activities and time constraints.

I have been off of my once regular regiment for a few months now but I'm off for the summer and have no excuse at all anymore, but I just can't seem to get back into it, I've tried but it just isn't there the way it was prior.

What methods do you use to help get yourself re-motivated again? any background images or posters that you look at daily that helps you stay focused? what type of goals(daily or long term) do you make for yourself that helps keep you going?

I really want to get back to my peak and feel the way I did then, I remember it was the most confidence I have ever had but that x-factor that I had seems to have dimmed with no sense of returning."
