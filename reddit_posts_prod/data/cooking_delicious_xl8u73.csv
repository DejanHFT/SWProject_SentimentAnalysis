What makes American sandwiches so delicious?,sabi_wasabi_,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/xl8u73/what_makes_american_sandwiches_so_delicious/,337,278,"I am American but have been living in Europe for 7+ years. European cuisine is superior in a lot of ways but I've noticed the sandwich game here is pretty mediocre. Whether it be hot, cold, vegetarian or meaty...American sandwiches are on a whole other level. 

I know that sandwiches are a huge part of American culture, so it only makes sense that they are better there. But, what are American restaurants doing to make them so tasty? What can I do to recreate them in Europe??

If it helps, I am vegetarian, but my partner eats meat. So any tips for both types of sandwiches are helpful!

Edit: Thank you all so much for your helpful comments! For those wondering:

- I am in Germany. But I have lived in the Netherlands and Scotland within these 7+ years.

- I am from the Northeastern US 

- There isn’t a specific sandwich I am trying to replicate, just the general gist of what the hell Americans do to make them so delicious like every time. My partner loves a Reuben though so any advice there is appreciated!

Edit 2: I can’t believe I have to make a NoT all eUroPEaN SanDwiCHes disclaimer but here it is. I’ve had fantastic sandwiches all over Europe, not only in the countries I’ve lived in. I’m just talking about their sandwich game IN GENERAL is IN MY OPINON sub par to American sandwiches IN GENERAL. I just wanted to know why and how I can replicate some basics. So thank you to everyone who commented with some cooking advice!"
