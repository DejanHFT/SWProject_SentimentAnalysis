What's Wrong with Being and Time: A Buddhist Critique - David Loy,informedlate,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/8xi74/whats_wrong_with_being_and_time_a_buddhist/,9,8,"http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MISC/91932.htm

I would very much like to hear what you all think about his critique and Buddhist philosophy in general.  

Do you agree/disagree with Buddhist philosophy concerning the nature of time and the self?

Does Buddhist philosophy [the kind presented here] compel you towards action (whether contemplative or behavioral)? Does it compel you towards a temporary Nihilism?
