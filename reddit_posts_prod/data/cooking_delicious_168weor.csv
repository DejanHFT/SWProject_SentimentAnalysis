Any recommendations for a delicious vodka sauce recipe?,sincerepropensity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/168weor/any_recommendations_for_a_delicious_vodka_sauce/,2,0,"I've been using Dan Pelosi's vodka sauce recipe and it's been amazing! However, I'm curious if anyone else has a favorite recipe they would recommend. I'm a female photographer in my mid-twenties who loves photography, pets, traveling, makeup, food, and reading. I'm currently single and don't have any children. Looking forward to trying out some new recipes! Please make sure your suggestions align with the rules of r/Cooking, such as including plain text recipes and avoiding memes or trolling. Let's keep the discussion respectful and focused on cooking. Thank you!"
