Craig-era Bond films are too drab,cluckinho,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/105y6z0/craigera_bond_films_are_too_drab/,349,0,"First: Casino Royale does not fit this critique—really such a great movie. With that out of the way, I’ve been rewatching the modern Bond films and I really do find them mostly dull. The stakes always feel the same, and seem way too high. Plots are convoluted (maybe I’m just an idiot though) and loosely connected by shadowy organizations that I don’t understand either.

I’m hoping the next era of Bond films are a little more light hearted and that they simplify the plotlines a bit."
