What is the worst line of Dialogue in the history of cinema?,Kantz_,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7446da/what_is_the_worst_line_of_dialogue_in_the_history/,1292,634,"""I hate Sand.""- Anakin Skywalker (written by George Lucas)

This line in particular gets my vote because this bit has always felt like the most ""artificial"" line of dialogue I have ever experienced. It is also impressive for the sheer amount of people that are aware of it and remember/quote it. When such a short line is able to find its way into our cultural subconscious (and for all the wrong reasons), I have to give it my vote for the worst of all time. "
