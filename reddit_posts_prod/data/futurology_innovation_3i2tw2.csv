When do you think China will become a world leader in innovation and R&D,Five_Decades,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3i2tw2/when_do_you_think_china_will_become_a_world/,65,30,"China already spends as a % of GDP around what most wealthy OECD nations spend (around 2%). In nominal terms they already spend about twice as much as Japan, and are only second to the US. Plus I get the impression they want to push for 3-4% of GDP for R&D, which means if/when their nominal GDP is 20 trillion in a decade they may be devoting 600-800 billion a year in R&D. 

However corruption and mismanagement are major issues there, and I don't see a lot of major innovation coming from China. Plus they look like they've had to create a system out of whole cloth in the last 15 years, their R&D investment was probably moot just 15 years ago. Creating an entire system out of nothing is going to cause problems. 

Anyone have any predictions for when China becomes a world leader in innovation regarding energy, biotech, AI, IT, communications, etc? 

Some things recently make me hope they are catching up. With the EM Drive, it was Chinese scientists who took it seriously and seem like they kept the project alive. 

Baidu is working on AI, and it was big news when they did better than US companies like google but it was found out that they cheated. 

I'm guessing late 2020s, maybe the early 2030s is when China will really start to become an innovation hub. A world where China can contribute to solving the worlds problems is going to be good. I know China recently said they wanted to work with the US on solving the world's biggest problems. Plus I secretly hope China taking R&D seriously will cause the EU to start investing more seriously, push for 3% of GDP rather than the 1-2% they are doing now. "
