Days Gone is a great game.,SweetPockets51,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/18jlg97/days_gone_is_a_great_game/,751,3022,"The release was shit and had a bunch of bugs. It’s a slow start and it takes a few hours to get it started but once you do, it’s great. The story is good, the strategy is challenging, and the twists are unpredictable. If you haven’t, give it a try. Get past the first 3-5 hours and you’ll not want to put it down."
