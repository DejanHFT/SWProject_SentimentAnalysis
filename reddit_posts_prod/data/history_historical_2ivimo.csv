Why are people so offended by historical truth?,vitani88,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2ivimo/why_are_people_so_offended_by_historical_truth/,174,105,"Today I made a comment in a group about the show, The American Adventure, at Epcot. The show does some major glossing over of the more ugly details of US history. For example, they mention the pilgrims arriving and ""claiming"" America and then they quickly jump ahead. The only mention of Native Americans comes when they talk about Chief Joseph and how he sided with the government. 

When I mentioned in this group how romanticized the whole thing was I was quickly told about how the pilgrims were BFFs with the Indians and the Indians dying and eventual removal just happened - there wasn't a plan to get rid of them. Shortly after that I was called out for ""bashing"" and ""despising"" my country. 

What is it about the truth of US history that is so offensive to people? I just cannot understand for the life of me why people wouldn't prefer to know what really happened! Are people in other countries this resistant to their own histories? "
