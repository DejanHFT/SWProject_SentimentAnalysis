I have a weird request for COVID music,MidnightCereal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/oxh81p/i_have_a_weird_request_for_covid_music/,602,1537,"I’m an ICU doctor.  

We are getting killed by COVID (again). I’m in a state that has literally run out of ICU beds. Today one of the doctors I was relieving told me “I got into my feels today and had to listen to some Titanic.”

Yeah, “My Heart Will Go On” is an appropriate COVID song, but serious overplay in the 90s kinda ruined it for me.  

What I’m looking for are songs that aren’t about COVID, but somehow fit the overall feeling of what’s going on right now.  They need to be widely popular. They don’t have to be sad. In fact songs that would be uplifting for those of us taking care of these people would be a bonus.  

Side note if you haven’t gotten your vaccination please do it.  This senseless loss of life is soul crushing to witness. 

For medical professionals:
Stay strong, get sleep, drink plenty of water, eat when you can, cry in a bathroom stall if you have to.  Keep a look out for staff who are having trouble coping. You’re not crazy, you really are seeing Americans die for no good reason.  You are not alone."
