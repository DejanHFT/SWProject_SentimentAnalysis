Most Badass Quotes from Historical Figures,AxtionJaxon07,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/26dvr6/most_badass_quotes_from_historical_figures/,1154,974,"What are some of your favorite quotes from historical figures that just make you go, ""Hell yeah.""  Mine are these:

Phillip II of Macedon to Sparta: ""You are advised to submit without further delay, for if I bring my army into your land, I will destroy your farms, slay your people, and raze your city.""

Sparta: ""If.""

To me that is a response that just oozes the simple badassery that Sparta was known for.  Also its worth noting that neither Phillip or Alexander decided to really screw around with Sparta after that.

So what about you guys?  What are some of your favorites?"
