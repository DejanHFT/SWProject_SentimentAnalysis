Worst movie you seen at the cinema?,gummydavidson,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/714e2r/worst_movie_you_seen_at_the_cinema/,954,162,"For me it's between these two classics;

Silent Hill Sequel: Just a terrible movie that had none of the moments that made the first movie a surprise success, they just tried to make it a cheap jump scare experience and they even failed to do that right.

The Darkest Hour: The only reason I actually remember this movie is it holds the acclaim of being the first ever 3D movie I ever seen, just a completely forgettable Sci-Fi movie that someone ended up getting a theatrical release and the 3D only ended up being used in a minute long scene, safe to say I was cursing the use of 3D in movies after seeing that movie.
