My running achievement,cruzj56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3avys6/my_running_achievement/,7,6,"Hey guys just want to celebrate a small victory. I've been depressed lately and I noticed today that while running I didn't feel sad at all, I couldn't even cry even though I had a moment where I wanted to. I was too out of breath which was uplifting. I figured if it worked for me it can help others too. Stay strong guys! "
