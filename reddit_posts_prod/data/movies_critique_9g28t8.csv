How can movie reviews/critiques be critiqued thoroughly without being biased?,sammyjamez,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9g28t8/how_can_movie_reviewscritiques_be_critiqued/,4,0,"I see this a lot in the movie phenomenon, whether it is critiquing it as an art form, or from its commercial or financial point of view, the technicalities, the cast and crew, the editing and so on.

If you go on Facebook or YouTube, you are going to find hundreds if not thousands of videos giving reviews and critiques of the same movies and their works - whether it is actual reviewers or artists who are very familiar with films and critique then thoroughly, or artists who make reviews thoroughly but without taking it too far (mostly in a manner that is humorous or casual or fun for the viewer like the Nostalgia Critic does this kind of review), and then you have people who are not directly familiar with films as an art form but give their own takes on the films, whether done in a thorough manner or not-so-thorough manner 

And considering that different people have different tastes and interests, you are going to find plenty of different points of view for the same films.

But at what level can movie critiques or reviews be done thoroughly without being biased or even done poorly?

For example, if a casual reviewer or someone who is not directly involved in the film industry or in film as an art form, even if a review made that person is done thoroughly, does that review still count when it is compared to someone who really knows film as an art form, as a product and so on?

What about possible biases because of different tastes or different interests?

Like for example many people really want to throw shit at Micheal Bay as a poor director and artist becuase of the Transformer films despite that his films ""Pain and Gain"" and ""13 Hours"" where given good reviews. Or how about Zack Synder whose recent works in the DCEU have received divisive reviews like Man of Steel, either you like it or hate it or the Justice League film.

Or how about critique the film from its works and how it was made? The cast and crew, the editing, the budget and so on? 

Is it really fair to criticise the studio for studio interference that may or may not have left a very deep impact on the film as a whole (like Suicide Squad or Blade Runner) even though they probably did it in order to save their assets?

Does it even matter to critique a sequel or a prequel for its take on the film even though plenty of people are probably going to see it anyway, especially if it is a well-known franchise or the marketing department did its job?

What about critiquing a film as a whole or when compared to other films, even though the same films of the same genre where done with different actors, directors, editors and so on?

(Like for example the Emoji movie gets a lot of criticism that despite the actions made by the characters, nothing really changed and the whole system stayed the same minus a few tiny changes.  Ironically, the film ""Wreck-it Ralph"", although it went well both commercially and financially, it had the same structure - apart that same changes happened, some of the things that were done effortlessly to change just stayed the same like Ralph is still the villain in the game)

(Or between the Bourne series which invented the shaky camera effect of action scenes vs other action films? Or the Chinese films of Jackie Chan where action scenes are done in one take with no cuts while American films often have multiple cuts or different angles in action scenes)

(Or is it fair to compare Marvel films vs DC films considering that both comic book universes have multiple versions of the same characters  like Batman is dark and gritty but not always that dark and mature or Spiderman is more upbeat and hopeful but can sometimes be dark and mature, and both universes have their own structures, storues and character arcs?)

(Or is it fair to compare the Star Wars prequels with the original trilogy considering that even though Lucas was not the director of the original films when compared to the prequels, most of the actual work and charm that made the films successes were the effects AND the editing - *not many people know how Lucas originally wanted the films to be made and if he did not listen to the editors, the films would have been made much differently and probably had different receptions.*)"
