[Achievement] First time DL @ 335... critique please,snakefactory,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3cvkfr/achievement_first_time_dl_335_critique_please/,5,0,"Hi everyone,

Long time lurker, have posted a bit here and there.

I did my first workout today that included singleton deadlifts.  I had been working 5x5 in my DL workouts but a good friend of mine who has achieved many of the goals that I have set for myself in the near and long term invited me out to check out my form and do a leg workout.  I did a decent squat at 205 for 3 reps but my left knee was coming in a bit after I came out of the hole and although I was able to grind up 225, my form was horrible.  Figuring out that 205 was my working weight in squat, we decided to move on to deadlift.  Before this workout I was doing 245 in deadlift with strict form 5x5.  Hearing this, my workout partner suggested we pyramid up and see where we go.  I was a bit apprehensive at first, but I put on 245 and banged out 5 no problem.  He suggested 275 for the next set for 3 and I hammered those too.  After about three minutes rest told me to up it to 295.  This weight came up with speed, and since I was using chalk for the first time, my grip strength felt great.  He asked how it felt since it looked good to him and I said it felt fine.  We upped it to three plates which I felt was a real milestone for me.  This is a link to the lift:

As you can see it came up pretty quick as well.  Again he asked how it felt and I said fine.  He concurred and said he felt I probably had one ore two more reps in me for that set so we upped the weight to 335.  This was the first time the weight actually felt heavy coming off the ground but I visualized driving my hips down and was able to bring it up.  My form wobbled a bit but I never stopped.  I improved form by increasing lat engagement at setup and the next two sets/reps (which I don't have recorded) went better than this lift:

My workout partner said that even though I have a middling squat at 225 and a pretty weak bench due to some shoulder issues (185 1RM bench) I seem to be a natural deadlifter.

I would love to hear a critique of my form and although I don't have the requisite 3 reps I'd appreciate some notes if any of you don't mind.
