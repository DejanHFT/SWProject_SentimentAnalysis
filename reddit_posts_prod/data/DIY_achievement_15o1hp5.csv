How to (non permanently) cover up granite countertops without causing damage in a rental,custardbuns,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15o1hp5,25,0,"    I recently moved into this apartment and am looking to tweak the kitchen into a more 70s/mid century modern inspired design.  While I love the rest of the kitchen, Im not a huge fan of the stone countertops that are installed.  I dont think the brown is very flattering in the space and I find the stone pattern too ""noisy""/distracting and difficult to clean.  I also want to add some sort of tile backsplash behind the stove.
     I was looking into covering it with counter top covers, but Im having difficulty finding information on whether or not they are safe to use over stone.  I will eventually need to remove them when my lease is up (we intend to renew, so potentially a couple years from now), and I dont want to cause  permanent damage to the stone/wall.  At the same time, I dont want to install covers that will peel off and bubble/look bad.  Our landlord may be open to actual tile being installed behind the stove as a backsplash, but if not, I will also be looking into installing a ""tile"" cover on that wall without causing permanent damage.
    I know covering up stone countertops is probably a less common problem to have lol, so any advice is greatly appreciated!  I have also included a couple pictures at the end to show the effect im trying to achieve."
