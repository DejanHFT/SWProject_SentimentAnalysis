Help me to study philosophy effectively on my own,crabmarkjellozest,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/d2dha/help_me_to_study_philosophy_effectively_on_my_own/,14,7,"I'd like to solicit general advice regarding the most effective way to begin seriously studying philosophy.  I have some *very* basic background from a few introductory courses I took as an undergraduate, but nothing worth discussing.

I also have a few specific questions to which I'd love to hear responses from those of you who are already many steps ahead of me:

- Deleted question.

- I have a particular interest in Kant, though only through excerpts.  What other ideas and works do I need to be familiar with to begin reading through some of his complete pieces, particularly the critiques?

- How should I take notes while reading?  Do you have a separate notebook for major pieces, or are some simple notes in the margins sufficient for you?  As a reminder, I'm doing this in an unstructured environment on my own so won't have the liberty of peers and professors to help clarify what I've missed.

Much obliged."
