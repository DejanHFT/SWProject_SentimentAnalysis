Best books to learn the philosophy of knowledge/ science,Apart_Imagination735,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1846ab7/best_books_to_learn_the_philosophy_of_knowledge/,3,2,"I am a medical student and I can't help but ask myself a lot of question about life and science. I find that alot  of the questions I ask myself stem from a lack of knowledge on the philosophy of knowledge and science itself.

Would appreciate any book recommendations/ authors for me to read. I'm not a very good reader, and my ability to dedicate time to said reading is limited, so more entry-level material would be appreciated. "
