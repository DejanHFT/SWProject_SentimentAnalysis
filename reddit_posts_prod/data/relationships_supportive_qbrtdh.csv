How do I (23 M) become a more supportive boyfriend? And is it worth it?,TheImperfectMan,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/qbrtdh/how_do_i_23_m_become_a_more_supportive_boyfriend/,4,3,"I (23, M) am dating a girl (21, F) that I met a few years ago in college, and we are going on 22 months of dating. We went to the same school, have the same major, and both work at companies that are direct competitors with each other (Public Accounting, so that kind of narrows it down to 4 choices). She is still in school and I have been with my firm 2 years.

I just started going back in 1-2 days per week and it seems like she still expects me to be there for her whenever she needs anything. Whenever she has a breakdown over studying for a test, a bad exam, or a fight she has with her roommates, it seems that she expects me to drop everything and be right by her side. And this has definitely played a toll on me physically and mentally. 

Today for example I had a great day at work, met the Chairman of my firm (a goal of mine) in the elevator and had a great team-connectivity event this evening and was so excited to tell her, but she is just so upset with me and doesn't want to talk to me because I don't tell her every time I go into a meeting and that I cannot talk to her. Sometimes my manager will walk over to me and say lets talk about this, and just going to my personal phone wouldn't be the right thing to do. I am also taking off to go back to my college tomorrow to give a presentation (the school she also goes to). My GF goes from wanting me to drive down 2 hours tonight at 11 PM, and when I tell her it is too late, she just says that she doesn't want to see me at all and that I she needed me today and that I wasn't there for her. She seems to expect and need me all the time everyday no matter my needs or goals in life and I just don't know how to split my time (or even if I should split my time) or even ways just to be better at this.

I have big career aspirations and just starting out I want to be dedicated and grow personally and professionally and I just feel like its hard to do that and be in a relationship. I just feel guilty expressing my happiness and joys in life because she always seems hurt.

TIA for all the help, support and advice! And I apologize for any delay in responses and comments I may have.

TL;DR! Girlfriend needs constant attention/support even when I am at work, and I feel guilty talking about my day when I have a good day at work."
