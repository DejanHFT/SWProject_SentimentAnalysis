Reviews:

Hollywood Reporter:

>Bigger, badder, bolder, longer, and featuring nearly more spectacular set pieces than one movie can comfortably handle, this epic action film practically redefines the stakes. 

IGN (10/10):

>Led by a committed Keanu Reeves, John Wick: Chapter 4’s incredibly staged set pieces, engaging ensemble, and stylish production design coalesce into a modern action masterclass. 

Variety:

>Is “Chapter 4” too long? You bet it is. At moments, it’s like the action film as liturgical church service. Yet the movie is conceived as a knowingly overstuffed gift to “John Wick” fans, and on that level it succeeds.

Deadline:

>More. More. More. That seems to be the mantra for the fourth edition in the wildly successful *John Wick* franchise. There is certainly more action with a whopping 14 action sequences, nearly four times the amount in previous *Wick* flicks; more locations including a Bond-like global journey from Jordan to Japan to Paris to Berlin; and like so many recent films more running time at 169 minutes, and you will want to stay right to the end of the end credits to get the most bang for your bucks. 

Slashfilm (9/10):

>By this point, someone reading a ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" movie review already has an opinion on the ""John Wick"" franchise. If more world-building, bigger action, and a deeper embrace of what its leading man does well all perk up your ears, you know what you need to know. As someone who has been in the tank for these movies for nearly a decade now, the fourth film is everything I wanted out of these movies. Yeah, I'm thinking he's back.

Entertainment Weekly (B+):

>*John Wick: Chapter 4*, in theaters this Friday, does not let a good concept rest; at 169 minutes, it is by far the longest installment to date, and easily the most relentless. As a moviegoing experience, it is also patently ridiculous and mostly very fun: the platonic ideal of a globe-hopping meatbag action thriller taken to its gloriously illogical extreme.  

The Wrap:

>Though it reaches a rushed conclusion, “John Wick 4” barrels along with charming idiosyncrasy. Reeves delivers each line as though he has just learned to speak for the first time. A fire-blasting shot gun gets some excellent screen time. Lausten’s cinematography has never been more inventive. Even when it drags — 169 minutes is a lot of time to fill, even for this masterful crew — the film gamely mixes comedy, action, and drama into one truly satisfying cocktail. If you’re more inclined to wait for streaming, make an exception just this once. Every audacious set piece, costume, and fight scene was clearly, lovingly made for the biggest of all big screens. 

The Playlist (A):

>Pure power, “John Wick: Chapter 4” is as exhilarating as it is exhausting. With this wildly satisfying world tour de force, Reeves’ Wick transcends icon status delivering the perfect bone-crunching crescendo to one of the great action franchises in cinema history. It’s pure gold.
