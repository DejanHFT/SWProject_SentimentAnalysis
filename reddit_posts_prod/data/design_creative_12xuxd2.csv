Who meets with clients in a creative agency?,Comfortable-Worker28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/12xuxd2/who_meets_with_clients_in_a_creative_agency/,6,0,"Hello, so I’m wondering who meets with clients who need branding, rebranding, social media posts, etc…

Are only account managers allowed to meet with clients? 

Please let me know I’ve been informed that as a designer I’m no longer able to meet with clients (ever) and that no agency lets designers talk with clients, only account managers. Is this true?"
