The narrative surrounding a lot of media nowadays is tainted by politics,Phoxtu-Marshmallow,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/14mrahx/the_narrative_surrounding_a_lot_of_media_nowadays/,18,0,"Now to clarify I’m not socially apathetic, I understand a lot of the messages and ideas being conveyed or thrown around during these conversations, but I do recognize harm that can arrive from inserting certain messages into movies, films and works where they were never wanted, let alone said misplaced messages being used to prop-up disingenuous movements and claims.

For example the whole conversation surrounding Pixar vs Disney (or Disney versus anyone) nowadays is warped due the lack of critique of creative companies on their writing, ethics and messages alone and now is more heavily directed towards thinly veiled excuses to misuse the format of comparative critique for other purposes.

I personally write in my spare time, and it’s genuinely disheartening to have seen the conversations surrounding Puss and Boots on release, how Dreamwork's is successful and Disney isn’t due to “Woke go Broke” when it’s, hear me out, just indicative of good writing in a film. Inflammatory low-hanging fruit dressed up as valid socio-political critique does a disservice to genuine issues in society and the medium of film as well."
