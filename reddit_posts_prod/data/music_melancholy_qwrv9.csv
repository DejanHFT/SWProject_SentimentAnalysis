Melancholy Female Vocalists?,straptin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/qwrv9/melancholy_female_vocalists/,11,9,"I've been on a big ""chick kick"" lately, and am wondering if reddit has any suggestions on who to add to my playlist. 

So far, I've found an interest in:

Portishead,
Imogen Heap,
Metric,
Bjork.

if anybody could send a few recommendations my way I'd sure appreciate it. New, Old, anything at all.
