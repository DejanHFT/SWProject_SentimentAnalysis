"During WWII, why were some German men able to attend university and avoid the military?",georgiabread57,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/h0nrkv/during_wwii_why_were_some_german_men_able_to/,78,1478,"Obviously universities in Nazi Germany were still functioning throughout the war, meaning there would have been male students attending (as well as the influx of female students). 

I just wondered how men were allowed to attend when so much of the male population was drafted into the military? Especially towards the end of the war when they got desperate. 

Could men attend classes and belong to the military at the same time? If so, how would they divide their time between both obligations? Would they only attend classes on leave?? (that seems unrealistic) Did they have to finish their service and/or be permanently discharged for injuries before they could attend? 

Were most male students exempt from the military simply for being students? Or did they require another reason, such as being physically unfit to serve?

I know many citizens had to perform six months or so in the Reich Labour Service before being allowed to attend university. Was this service enough to keep the male students out of the military? 

Any insights into these questions would great! Thank you!"
