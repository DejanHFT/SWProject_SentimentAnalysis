Where do you travel to for a real adventure?,XiMs,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/sjh49h/where_do_you_travel_to_for_a_real_adventure/,18,6,"I was watching this show on nat geo, called [“welcome to earth”](https://youtu.be/i0MTCXgil1M) where they do things like travel to Vanuatu and check out a volcano, dive with sperm whales, go to the Namibian desert, go inside an iceland glacier, explore the Serengeti, etc.

And I started to wonder, are adventures like this possible for a “normal person” like me and you to experience? If so, where does one go?"
