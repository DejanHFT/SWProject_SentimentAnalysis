Tonight I made a delicious shrimp scampi.,EmilyamI,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/18u42rs/tonight_i_made_a_delicious_shrimp_scampi/,508,2256,"When it was done, I offered to step out to the garage fridge to grab everyone a drink. 

In my absence, my dad dumped a bunch of Old Bay and a can of tuna in it because it ""Looked like it needed something.""

It's disgusting and nobody will eat it and he's passive-aggressively huffing around the house because ""nobody will eat the dinner I[he] made.""

Lord, give me strength."
