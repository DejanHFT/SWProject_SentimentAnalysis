Best adventure based Caribbean destination for April?,la_les,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17eg7b6/best_adventure_based_caribbean_destination_for/,6,2,"A group of us (mid 20s) are wanting to visit the Caribbean for 14 days. 3 of my friends are flight attendants so have travelled to quite a lot of countries and are experienced travellers. I’ve already been to the Bahamas and Cuba. 

We don’t want an all inclusive resort and would prefer to move around, rent an Airbnb and possibly a car to explore.

We would like a mix of:

- Culture 
- Food 
- Adventure 
- Beautiful beaches (bonus if there’s decent diving) 

We have already counted 2 full days of travel (coming from Australia and UAE) so have 14 full days. We are thinking possibly Puerto Rico and Cuba? I went to Cuba 8 years ago and didn’t get to explore as much as I wanted to so I would like to go again. Or possibly doing Cuba and Roatan? We also really wanted to do Jamaica but I’ve read it’s not safe to leave the resort. 

I’ve been researching all day and every country I’ve come across seems like the place you stay at the resort all day and go on a snorkeling tour which is a great way to relax but not the trip we are after."
