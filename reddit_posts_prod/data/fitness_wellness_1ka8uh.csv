"Well guys and gals, I got a hernia.",AccidentallySwole,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1ka8uh/well_guys_and_gals_i_got_a_hernia/,50,50,"Today I was doing legs.  I am focusing on hypertrophy and form(as always), so I wasn't lifting heavy.

I got through my squat and deadlift no problem.  Get to leg press, my third exercise.  I put on 7 plates total, weight I've done for a single set of 20 before.  I say that to emphasize that I wasn't doing anything beyond my limits.  I wasn't being stupid and trying to throw a ton of weight around.  I finished my first two sets of 12, the first close stance and the second with my feet about shoulder width.  I got to my third set, which is wide stance.  I pump out my first 5 reps nbd.  Even breathing, good depth, and no movement outside of my legs.  On the 6th rep I just wasn't focusing on keeping my core tight and I felt a sharp, burning pain on the right side of my Adonis Belt, like something was being pulled apart.  Fuck.  That's all I thought.  I'm going to school in hope to one day be a physical therapist so right away I knew what was up.  I went over to the mirror and sure enough there was a line running along my Adonis Belt.  

I'll be going to the doctor to get a referral so I can fix this bullshit and get back to my iron sanctuary.

I just want to remind/scare/emphasize that it is important to keep your core tight.  Don't suffer a set back when it is so easy to avoid.  Form isn't just about your ROM and the body parts you're focusing on.  It includes your core, head, feet, etc.  Focus on doing things properly that way a simple mistake doesn't injure you.  Weight lifting is supposed to have one of the lowest injury rates of any sport, and that's because everything is supposed to be controlled.

I hope y'all stay safe.

Edit:  good news, I only tore the top layer of muscle!"
