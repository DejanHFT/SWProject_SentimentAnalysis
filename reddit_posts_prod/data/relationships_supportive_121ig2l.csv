TLDR: My partner lost a high paying job after I've financially supported us.

EDIT 1: I am in therapy and have been for some time. My therapist is a cognitive, trauma based therapist and we do good work together. We have been working through this situation as well.

EDIT 2: We would have not moved in together if we didn't live so far away (again, 90 minutes on a good day.) I would have bought a house with or without this relationship, but him getting the job led us living together.

EDIT 3: I don't super care if someone makes whatever, but we live in an expensive state, at $40,000 he was barely able to afford rent, groceries, and a car payment. 

My partner and I have been together for almost a year now. When we met, I was getting out of a really bad relationship with an abusive ex. I was living alone, comfortably. I wasn't looking for a long term relationship, but we had so much in common and felt so connected to him that I couldn't help falling in love with him. He lived over an hour and a half away, but with the flexibility of my job I was able to visit him often.

He was barely scraping by financially. His job paid him slightly over 40k a year, while I work two jobs that comfortably total over 100k. I paid for everything - dates, gas, groceries - you name it. At the time, I thought little of it. I saw it as a natural compromise of making more, and I was so happy to have found a nice guy who was emotionally intelligent. This past fall, my grandmother died. She was the only relative I have. My mom is a drug addict, and my father passed away when I was 19. I got to spend Christmas and Thanksgiving with my partner and his family and feel like I belonged somewhere. He was so supportive through the entire experience.

I've been wanting to buy a house for some time. Around the death of my grandmother, I put in offer in on a house and it was accepted. I can pay for it on my own, but to save the way I want to, I need help. The house is big enough for me to have a roommate, and honestly with the housing costs in my area, I could have them pay well over half my mortgage. But I offered it to my partner who agreed to move in and pay half the mortgage. I figured down the road, he could put his name on the lease, or we could buy a house together. Ultimately it was about the same price as an apartment.

After 10 years of applying for (and being rejected from) jobs he got a new job making over 60K. This was a huge relief, and I was so excited for us to have more equal footing. But instead of being happy or relieved with his new job, he was grumpy and annoyed by it. His complaints were his commute time (20-30 minutes), his work (full time grant writer), a dreary office, and that he didn't believe in the company he worked for. On his third day of work, he teared up in his boss's office and told her that he didn't think that he could do the job. Seven weeks later, she fired him.

I totally understand why my partner lost his job. A big part of his work was front facing to major donors. He knew almost nothing about the organization - instead of researching and asking his new boss how to best prepare for his new role, he spent his transition time leading a job search for his old organization (partially unpaid, they ended going with a friend of the company for his role).

I've been so upset with him for messing up this opportunity. I work between 50-70 hours a week. Since meeting him, I've put almost no money into savings. He's been applying to jobs, but most of them are retail or counter jobs that pay less than the one he had making 40K. This past week, he's gone out to lunch three times. He's done work around the house, but hasn't been been proactive in larger projects to help us move in -- like assembling furniture or setting up a room. He's applying to jobs, but it just feels like he has no fire to get back what he lost -- namely financial stability.

I have not been able to be supportive. I've been so angry at him for throwing away an opportunity and a stable source of income. All I see when I look at him is laziness and selfishness. I want to move past these feelings, and find love for him again, but I just don't know how to make it better."
