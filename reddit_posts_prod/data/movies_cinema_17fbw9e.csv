"If we went back to having to wait a number of months before a film was available at home, would people be more inclined to go to the cinema?",crumble-bee,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/17fbw9e/if_we_went_back_to_having_to_wait_a_number_of/,925,780,"I feel like it’s pretty apparent that movies that stream on the same day or within a matter of weeks of their cinema release are suffering at the box office as people just wait for streaming. 

Do you think that if we went back to the old model of 3-4 months between a cinema release and a “home video” release, and people knew that the only way to watch the movie would be to go to the cinema or suffer through a shitty CAM copy, people would be more inclined to go to the cinema? 

It seems pretty logical - I would certainly go to the cinema even more if I knew that a movie wasn’t going to be on streaming for months, and I can’t see why companies aren’t doing that. Is there a reason? How long do you think we should have to wait?"
