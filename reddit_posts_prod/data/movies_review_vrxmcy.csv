Ben Travis, [Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/thor-love-and-thunder/) (4/5)

>In so many ways, for mostly better and occasionally worse (a jaunt to Omnipotent City drags a touch), *Thor: Love And Thunder* is a deeply weird, deeply wonderful triumph. It’s a movie that dares to be seriously uncool, and somehow ends up all the cooler for it — sidesplittingly funny, surprisingly sentimental, and so tonally daring that it’s a miracle it doesn’t collapse. The Gorr-centric cold-open is as dark as the MCU gets, but this is also a *Thor* romcom with a loved-up ABBA montage, and a Viking longboat pulled through space by a pair of gigantic screaming goats (who nearly run away with the film). It’s a movie about midlife crisis that feels like you’re watching one in action, with its gourmet gods, glorious intergalactic biker-chicken battle, and Guns N’ Roses galore (the ‘November Rain’ solo is deployed *perfectly*). And come the closing reel, when the true meaning of its title is unveiled, it leaves our hero in a place so sweet and surprising, you’ll be truly moved. It’s a Taika Waititi movie, then — we could watch his cinematic guitar solos all day. ---

>This is the kind of movie in which the kingly verve of Tessa Thompson’s Valkyrie is almost enough to offset how little her character gets to do. It’s the kind of movie that ends on such an emotionally satisfying note that I was willing to forgive — and all too able to forget — the awkward path it traveled to get there, or how clumsily it gathered its cast together for the grand finale. If “Love and Thunder” is more of the same, it’s also never less than that. The MCU may still be looking for new purpose by the time this movie ends, but the mega-franchise can take solace in the sense that Thor has found some for himself.

>So, while there might be complaints about the film's pacing or weaker first half, *Thor: Love and Thunder* recaptured exactly what charmed me about these MCU movies. I never once rolled my eyes at a joke that was clearly dropped in, so it could be a zinger and make it to the trailer. It successfully silenced a rather jaded MCU fan by offering a story that had it all without having to sacrifice its soul to the MCU machine that is eager to churn out stories for future phases.

>Thor: Love and Thunder is held back by a cookie-cutter plot and a mishandling of supporting characters, but succeeds as the MCU's first romantic comedy thanks to Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman's chemistry.

>Even in Valhalla or Paradise City, though, there is still love and loss; *Thor* dutifully delivers both, and catharsis in a climax that inevitably doubles as a setup for the next installment. More and more, this cinematic universe feels simultaneously too big to fail and too wide to support the weight of its own endless machinations. None of it necessarily makes any more sense in Waititi's hands, but at least somebody's having fun.

David Rooney, [Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/thor-love-and-thunder-1235175416/)

>Sure, fans will be delighted to see Chris Pratt and the *Guardians of the Galaxy* crew turn up in an early battle, plus there are some mildly moving interludes between Hemsworth and Portman as Jane’s health becomes more compromised with each swing of the hammer. And one of the obligatory end-credits sequences will tantalize followers of *Ted Lasso*. But right down to a sentimental ending that seems designed around “Sweet Child O’ Mine,” the movie feels weightless, flippant, instantly forgettable, sparking neither love nor thunder.

>The best thing that can be said about ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is that as rough as the experience is, it's nowhere near as bad as ""Thor: The Dark World."" And Christian Bale is going for it as Gorr. (The same can also be said for his ""3:10 to Yuma"" co-star Russell Crowe, who makes an extended cameo appearance as the legendary god Zeus here, turning the Olympian god into a fey and selfish ninny. If any part of the movie is truly hilarious, it's the scene with Zeus, and it's because of Crowe.) But maybe ""Thor: Ragnarok"" was, at least for the world of Marvel, too good to be topped. Or maybe you can only get so lucky so many times. As hard as the cast and Taika Waititi try, though, it just doesn't work. ""Thor: Ragnarok"" felt effortless. ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is working very hard, and not getting a lot to show for it.

Owen Gleiberman, [Variety](https://variety.com/2022/film/reviews/thor-love-and-thunder-review-chris-hemsworth-natalie-portman-taika-waititi-1235308880/)

>In the end, however, it’s the mix of tones — the cheeky and the deadly, the flip and the romantic — that elevates “Thor: Love and Thunder” by keeping it not just brashly unpredictable but emotionally alive. In Kenneth Branagh’s “Thor,” Natalie Portman held her own as Thor’s earthly love interest, but here, pulling up on equal footing with him, Portman gives a performance of cut-glass wit and layered yearning. Jane might want Thor back, but she’s furious at how he let his attention drift away from her (though having a smirking megalomaniac half-brother with borderline personality disorder will do that to you). She’s also reveling in her power, even as she wages battle against a hidden malady it can’t save her from. (The hammer won’t help; using it drains her.)

Kaitlyn Booth, [Bleeding Cool](https://bleedingcool.com/movies/thor-love-and-thunder-review-weirdly-restrained-and-lacking-emotion/) (7/10)

>Thor: Love and Thunder tries to make the Ragnarok lightning strike twice, but the movie ends up feeling restrained due to the lack of genuinely emotional moments and some baffling creative decisions.

>Thor embarks on a journey unlike anything he's ever faced -- a quest for inner peace. However, his retirement gets interrupted by Gorr the God Butcher, a galactic killer who seeks the extinction of the gods. To combat the threat, Thor enlists the help of King Valkyrie, Korg and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster, who -- to his surprise -- inexplicably wields his magical hammer.
