How much muscle mass can be achieved through strength training?,JonDick13926,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/bjinl7/how_much_muscle_mass_can_be_achieved_through/,5,0,"The average person who works out to look better, feel better, be healthier, etc will often hear that if you want size then train for size and if you want strength then train for strength.

From what I’ve seen, though, some people who train primarily for strength see a lot of muscle growth and others do not.  They get stronger, they just don’t get larger.

For years I trained for hypertrophy, and I did see growth, but I got bored with it because I wasn’t seeing my numbers go up quickly.  I was doing sets of 8-12 reps on all of my lifts.

A few months ago I chose the following exercises to do and started doing 10 sets of 3 reps at around 85% of my 1RM.  I’be seen a large increase in strength but a surprising increase in muscle size that I didn’t get from my old style of training.

Deadlifts
Squats
BB Bench Press
Standing BB Overhead Press
Weighted Pull-ups
BB Rows

I was already doing most of these exercises,  I just didn’t see as much size until I ditched the 8-12 rep range for 3 rep sets of 10 at heavier weight.

I’m wondering if genetics plays a significant role is whether or not someone can build a lot of size from building strength, or if this has all happened because my body was surprised by the total change up."
