Help with naming characters that draw inspiration from Asian naming conventions around the world but don't directly follow any!,pillow-bug,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18cawzk/help_with_naming_characters_that_draw_inspiration/,9,0,"Hey all,  
Sorry if this is the absolute wrong place to post this, and if it is could anyone direct me to a better place!  
I'm writing a fantasy story that isn't set in our world but I'm trying to base the unique countries and such on real world countries to give it a stronger foundation... however I'm running into some trouble naming characters. Since countries like China and Japan don't exist here, I can't exactly make characters Chinese and name them accordingly, but I don't want to just name them ""Asian-inspired names"" and run into angry folk that way. But I really don't know a whole lot about Chinese names and Asian names in general (the reason I mention Chinese names a lot is because a character I have absolutely has to have the given name Nuwa, which is Chinese) and I'd like to depict elements of the culture accurately and respectfully. Throughout the stories, various other countries and characters that are inspired by different countries all take elements from these real-world cultures but don't directly mimic any of them. It's just, as someone who is English and German in heritage, I feel a lot more comfortable doing that with countries that I have a direct claim to heritage from, and I would like to respectful when portraying different cultures.   
Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is how would I name characters in a story that come from countries loosely based on several Asian countries but not directly meant to represent any one country.   
If anything I have said in this post is offensive I apologize and any corrections on language or beliefs would be appreciated and welcome! I'd just like to say again that ALL countries in the story are kind of a mish-mash of ""similar"" countries that we have here on Earth and this is not meant to disregard the unique traditions and culture of unique individual cultures, it is just meant to give me inspiration to create and new, FICTIONAL country. 

Thanks so much for any kind constructive input, it's really appreciated. "
