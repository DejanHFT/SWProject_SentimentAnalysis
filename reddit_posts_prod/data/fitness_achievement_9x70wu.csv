"In general, can one maintain an achieved physical aesthetic with less of an output than it took to achieve said physical aesthetic?",AreYouNotEntertayned,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9x70wu/in_general_can_one_maintain_an_achieved_physical/,5,2,"Or does one need to maintain the equivalent work output it took to maintain their achieved aesthetic? I’m guessing genetics play a role, but in general. I’m not even sure what particular sub category of fitness knowledge that falls into, or what you would call it exactly, but it’s definitely something I’ve been wondering after achieving some aesthetic goals of mine when it comes to fitness. 

I’m also hypothesizing that it depends on what level of physical aesthetic one has achieved, but I’m guessing their has to be some kind of correlation between a certain physical result and the output it takes to maintain said physical result, with a certain percentage of genetics playing a role as well, albeit a smaller role.

I would also hypothesize that one can maintain their physical aesthetic with less output than it took to achieve but perhaps lose conditioning or strength. May be  wishful thinking on my part but surely someone has a more precise answer or can share from experience."
