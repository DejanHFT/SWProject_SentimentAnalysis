What song of a favorite band of yours would you introduce a new listener with?,wigwam2323,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/2xf5ls/what_song_of_a_favorite_band_of_yours_would_you/,5110,2426,"I find that so many recommended artists are suggested to me by just their name, and I never find the motivation to go listen for myself on my own time. Recently, when someone suggests someone to me, I've been asking what their favorite song is and playing it. If I like it, I'll hop on the fanwagon most likely and give them a shot.

Feel free to post more than one song or artist, recommending favorites should be tough decisions. It can be old or new, and provide the genre if it's someone lesser known.

Edit: awesome thread already! I'm gonna have an endless amount of new tunes to check out."
