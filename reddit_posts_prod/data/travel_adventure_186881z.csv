G adventures as a black traveler,LastZookeepergame495,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/186881z/g_adventures_as_a_black_traveler/,20,9,"I (31 soon to be 32 F) am looking at the coasta rica 18 to 30 somethings group tour. This would be my firs time traveling “solo”. The itinerary looked good with two free days. I am worried about what the experience will be for someone like me. The only thing I found about the black experience is the girl who wrote about her racist experience where people even refused to sit next to her.

So I wanted to see if any other person who is black has traveled with G adventures and what their experience was. I am also open to hear from those where their group included a black traveler.

Additional notes: I want to truly travel solo but it was overwhelming for the first one. I want the experience of going around a foreign country without having to worry about every detail. I am hoping this experience will give me the confidence to really venture on my own.


Update: I did go on the 8 day trip to Costa Rica with the 18 to 39 age group. It is easily one of the best experiences. I was the only black person in the group but never faced any discrimination. It was not the party group I feared based on comments. I don’t think any one went partying at any point.

The pros: having a local guide that was able to show us experiences I couldn’t have figured out on my own. In addition, he was helpful with locating restaurants and any other resources needed. I met so many incredible people and already made plans to visit them in their country. 

The cons: the stays. I am not a hostel girl by any means and it was hard. I could not even sleep at one of them because the bed was so uncomfortable and they only provided us with sheets. They were clean for the most part. Additionally there were several annoying people on the trip who were unreasonably loud and obnoxious. But that is not G adventures fault. Just avoided those people at all cost. "
