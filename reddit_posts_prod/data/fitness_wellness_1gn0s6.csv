Bench and OHP not progressing well,Ititmore,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1gn0s6/bench_and_ohp_not_progressing_well/,31,5,"I've been doing SL5x5 for about 2 months now. I'm a typical endomorph, and while my squats and deadlifts have increased dramatically, my bench press and OHP have not progressed as well. These are my so far improvements:

All lifts are my 5x5 repping weight:
Squat: 95-195

Deadlift: 135-205

Bench: 95-115

OHP: 55-85

While I think my OHP progress is acceptable, I feel like my Bench is painfully low. I have been stuck already at 115 for bench and have deloaded,  but I just reached the same problem when I built back up to 115. Thank you in advance for your comments."
