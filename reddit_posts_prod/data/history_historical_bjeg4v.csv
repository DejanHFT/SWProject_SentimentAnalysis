Is anybody else here related to a historical figure?,Zack_WithaK,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/bjeg4v/is_anybody_else_here_related_to_a_historical/,70,22,"Pretty recently, I found out that my lineage is has been around in history. On my mom's side: A few years ago, I learned that I'm blood-related to Goody Proctor from the Salem Witch Trials (Now I wish I paid more attention to the Crucible when I was in school). My grandma said she has documents but sadly, she couldn't find them when I asked her to look for them

And on my dad's side: My lineage can be traced to people that came off of the Mayflower. I'm German and Polish and I have relatives that fought against each other in the same battle in WWII I don't know which battle, but I'll talk to my uncle some time so I can learn more about that.

At some point, I'll do a 23&Me type thing and might do a follow-up post if I find out anything new from any of the above sources

Does anyone else have any historical blood in them?

**Where my history peeps at?**

Edit: I just remembered that I'm also related to a member of Jesse James's gang on my dad's side"
