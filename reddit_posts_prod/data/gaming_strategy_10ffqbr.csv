Trying to find an old strategy game. Please help me.,Gameaddict93,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10ffqbr/trying_to_find_an_old_strategy_game_please_help_me/,6,5,"EDIT : FOUND IT - TOTEM TRIBE

Few things that I remember.

1. It has a gold edition version
2. Collectibles for 100% completion includes collecting gems from all levels, that also increases the population from house by +1
3. You can make limited number of buildings and each building generates limited number of humans to do stuffs. Fight, magic, etc
4. In the gold edition there is a rainbow type cloud level, which when you complete you can get +1 bonus on population from each building.
5. There are alien/ black magic shadow kind of things. Pretty hard to beat.
6. There are sharks in the lake/sea/river and you can't swim, cuz you do not know how to. But after one level your humans get the power to swim. And after one more power/magic, you can get those sharks to stop attacking you (I don't remember if this part is true, it's kind of an old game)
7. In the last boss level - You can defeat that thing in two ways - Either sacrifice your units to different 8/10 holes and close them. Those holes has teeth kind of thing. And that sacrifice kills the final boss. Or you build up your army and slowly keep hitting the boss to finally defeat him.
8. You need to learn to swim so that you can explore every land 100% and gain extra bonus.
9. There are different powers and stuffs but I am unable to recall it fully.
10. The buildings looked hut type.

That's all I remember from this game. It was quite an interesting game but I am unable to remember it.

It's not Heroes Of Might and Magic series.

But this game is kind of like Age of Empires as it's a continuous gameplay and not turn based."
