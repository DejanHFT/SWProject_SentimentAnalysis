"AskScience AMA Series: We're Cheryl Bowman, Deputy Branch Chief for High Temperature and Smart Alloys, and Sean Clarke, Principal Investigator, X-57 Maxwell Experimental Aircraft. We are part of the NASA team that is developing new technology for Electrified Aircraft. Ask us anything.",AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/kew6j3/askscience_ama_series_were_cheryl_bowman_deputy/,205,2652,"Join us today at 2 p.m. ET (19 UT) to ask anything about NASA's recent technology developments for Electrified Aircraft Propulsion - the use of propulsors (propellers or fans) driven by electric motors to propel or help propel aircraft ranging from air taxis to subsonic transports.  From developing technology to aircraft concepts to flight testing, we're working toward a new generation of aircraft with a lower carbon footprint.

+ We built and tested a lithium-ion battery pack that uses Space Station technologies to improve safety and reliability - already being used in other experimental aircraft!
+ We've doubled the temperature capability of soft magnetics for flight electronics.
+ We will soon be flight testing the all-electric X-57 Maxwell Experimental Aircraft in a 2-motor, 150 kW mode followed by a 14-motor, 300 kW flight test on a high-performance wing.
+ We are using what we learn on experimental aircraft and in laboratories to help write the design and test standards for electric propulsion system in future passenger aircraft.
+ We can't wait to answer your questions on how we're turning this idea from science fiction to reality.

Participants include:

+ Cheryl Bowman, Deputy Branch Chief for High Temperature and Smart Alloys
+ Sean Clarke, Principal Investigator, X-57 Maxwell Experimental Aircraft and Advanced Systems Development Engineer
