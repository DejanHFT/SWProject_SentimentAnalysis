Spouse of 6yrs isn't supportive of me going to volunteer in Maui,gopherwoman98,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15wv1no/spouse_of_6yrs_isnt_supportive_of_me_going_to/,14,1,"Volunteering for Maui Fire Relief

Hey all, I (25f) and my partner of 6 years (36m) have head butted each other about this issue. I am extremely passionate about helping tribal people (considering I'm a tribal member myself, NOT Hawaiian descent) and my heart sank when I heard about the fire that destroyed Maui. These are tribal people, which means that they're basically brothers and sisters to me. I wanted to take a week or two to go over to Maui and volunteer my time to help out with whatever they need help with. I've already done my research (and yes they do need more volunteers), but I feel like I cannot stand here idol while they're suffering. 

I am self employed, we have a cleaning business together and a child (4f). I would bring my daughter with me to Maui if I needed to or have her stay with her grandma while im gone (who doesn't mind AT ALL for taking care of her). I asked him if he could cover my shifts for me, so I could go and volunteer. He basically told me, ""you're being so fucking selfish, they don't need your help, and they have plenty of volunteers already, they don't need you, so you're just going to give up and abandon your family to help these people?"". 

So yeah, that's his take on me leaving to go and pursue something that I care so deeply about. It honestly breaks my heart, because I know that i deserve better with a partner who is more supportive of me. I even told him that if he was passionate about helping somebody or an organization, I would gladly take over and do the hard work of keeping the business running so he can pursue what he wants. 

TL;DR: My spouse isn't supportive of me going to Maui to volunteer, he claims ""they don't need my help, and I'm selfish for wanting to go, and that I am abandoning my family and work to help strangers.""

Update: The time spand would be for two weeks of my time. I would not be relocating to Maui. I would be going there to help with the fire relief efforts."
