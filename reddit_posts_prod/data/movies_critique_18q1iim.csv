You've all probably heard ""forced diversity"", ""subverted expectations"", ""strong female character"" said mostly toward Disney and MCU movies a while back, and chances are, you're either annoyed, amused, or just plain tired at the mention of them. Which memes/complaints have you heard the most, and what causes you to feel a certain way about them?"
