Pretentious Movies,belegradhammer,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sne551/pretentious_movies/,32,2,"What do you mean when you use the word ""pretentious"" to describe a film? What are you really saying and what would be an example of a movie you yourself would define as one?

I see the word paroted often and i understand the textbook definition of it but when atributed to a movie it's meaning often becomes blurry.

Despite this even google uses a movie example to define the word 

""attempting to impress by affecting greater importance or merit than is actually possessed.""

""pretentious art films""

It seems very subjective and by it's very definition it of course is. However i still wish to ask you about your own criteria of decribing a movie as so. Maybe we could shed some light on one of the most common critique in the movie industry that most people reading said critique could not themselves define if you would ask them to do so"
