G Adventures trip: Local Living Italyâ€”Amalfi Coast Winter,WranglerMany,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/159p8nh/g_adventures_trip_local_living_italyamalfi_coast/,7,1,"Has anyone been on this trip, and how did you like it? I'm a woman in her thirties, traveling solo and I've been on a G Adventures trip before but it was quite awhile ago (and it was a YOLO group). If you've done this one and wouldn't recommend it, is there a better European G Adventures (or Intrepid, etc.) that's reasonably priced that you would recommend? Thanks in advance! "
