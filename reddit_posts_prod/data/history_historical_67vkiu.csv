"What are your favorite historical date comparisons (e.g., Virginia was founded in 1607 when Shakespeare was still alive).",PooTeeWeet5,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/67vkiu/what_are_your_favorite_historical_date/,6405,21055,"In a recent Reddit post someone posted information comparing dates of events in one country to other events occurring simultaneously in other countries. This is something that teachers never did in high school or college (at least for me) and it puts such an incredible perspective on history.

Another example the person provided - ""Between 1613 and 1620 (around the same time as Gallielo was accused of heresy, and Pocahontas arrived in England), a Japanese Samurai called Hasekura Tsunenaga sailed to Rome via Mexico, where he met the Pope and was made a Roman citizen. It was the last official Japanese visit to Europe until 1862.""

What are some of your favorites?
