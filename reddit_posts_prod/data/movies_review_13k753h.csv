* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fast_x): 58% (116 Reviews)

>As irredeemably silly as it is satisfyingly self-aware, Fast X should rev the engines of longtime fans while leaving many newcomers in neutral.

**Reviews**

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/fast-x-review-jason-momoa-1235492802/):

>What saves Fast X is that it’s so aware of its own absurdity that it becomes an entertaining parody of itself.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2023/05/fast-x-review-vin-diesel-jason-momoa-1235370096/):

>With its seemingly inexhaustible supply of madly amusing action, this high-octane extravaganza attempts, and not infrequently succeeds, in obliterating any resistance with its disarming, outrageous and self-aware injections of often-hilarious camp.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/fast-x-review-vin-diesel-jason-momoa-1235613281):

>“X” marks the spot where the property’s most dependable director, Justin Lin, called it quits. You may be tempted to do the same.

[Indiewire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/fast-x-review-1234864252) (C+):

>
[It's] engaging in the oldest trick in the book, using flamboyance (read: queerness) to signal evil. Pitted against the raging paternalism of Dom Toretto’s singular guiding purpose to protect his family at all costs, the moral edict is crystal clear.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/fast-x-review-jason-momoa-vin-diesel/):

>'F9' made a convincing case for letting this whole 'Fast and Furious' series finally end. But just when you thought it was okay to check out, 'Fast X' pulls you back in.

[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/05/17/fast-x-movie-review-vin-diesel-jason-momoa/70222870007) (2.5/4):

>Much of the spectacle in this 10th film rehashes bonkers situations and scenes done before (and better), a running theme that also pervades much of the narrative.

[AV Club](https://www.avclub.com/fast-x-movie-review-vin-diesel-1850442449) (B-):

>Diesel believes in Dom so hard that for two hours and 10 minutes, he makes you believe in him too.

[Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movies/movie-reviews/fast-x-review/) (C):

>No question this franchise is silly...but having one character constantly ridiculing the others and making mockery of everything feels maybe a little too on-the-nose.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/fast-x/) (3/5):

>It's a film that somehow finds new and fabulously silly things to do with cars, while — Momoa’s questionable villain aside — being exactly what you’d expect.

[Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/17/fast-10-movie-review-fast-and-furious-sequel-vin-diesel) (3/5):

>Fast X has enough joyful self-awareness that resistance becomes futile. At a certain point, it feels better to give in and smile.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/fast-x-review) (5/10):

>An underwhelming lead-up to the series finale, Fast X's only real redeeming quality is Jason Momoa's bonkers performance as the villain.

[ScreenCrush](https://screencrush.com/fast-x-review/) (3/10):

>For the first time in the franchise’s history, there isn’t a single sequence that outdoes what has come before.

**Synopsis**:

>Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto  and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever.  

>In 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante, witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price.

>Dante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance.
