Motivation success!,tj3406,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ygrmt/motivation_success/,44,262,"So 1 year ago, I heard about this thing called the spartan race. I was 240lbs, and hadn't run more than a couple feet in any decent length of time. I set a goal to be fit enough to compete this year, and used what I learned from creeping all of your success stories here on fittit! Today I ran the 5k obstacle course in just over 30 minutes, and so far have lost 70lbs.

I just wanted to say 2 things; 
1. Thank every one of you for your inspiration and motivation. Your words of encouragement and stories of success are a constant inspiration to me!
2. To everyone, you can achieve your goals! Never give up! "
