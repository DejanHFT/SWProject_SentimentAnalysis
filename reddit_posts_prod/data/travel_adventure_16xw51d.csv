Should I book an organized adventure or do it myself?,backcountry_man,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16xw51d/should_i_book_an_organized_adventure_or_do_it/,8,0,"Hi everyone, 

I am planning to take a bigger vacation in January and am thinking about choosing one of the organized adventure providers (Intrepid, Destination Services, G Adventures,..... name them all) 

In the past, I always enjoyed booking my itinerary but now with a job convenience is one factor why I even consider them.   

What are your experiences with such providers and what values to you see in booking an organized adventure? 

Thankful for any advice you have for me. "
