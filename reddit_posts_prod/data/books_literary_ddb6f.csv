just got my second [literary themed tattoo](http://i.imgur.com/V9jvE.jpg). this one combines *dinotopia* by james gurney, one of my favorite books growing up, and the font panhandler, used on the cover of tom rachman's *the imperfectionists* (which, if you haven't picked up, you should.) the [first tattoo](http://imgur.com/FZuzt.jpg) represents my favorite scene from *fahrenheit 451* by the esteemed ray bradbury.

anybody else out there have ink to represent the books that you love?"
