I(26M) told my GF(24F) not to financially support her sister-in-law.,Emergency_Being7660,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18s4oab/i26m_told_my_gf24f_not_to_financially_support_her/,70,150,"Context: Sister-in-law of my GF does not work and has complained to my GF about her phone being slow and wants an upgrade, however has no money to buy a new phone.

Now my GF is giving her sister-in-law the money to buy the brand new iPhone 15 pro max (in the thousands $$$) ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

I told my GF of 5 years NOT to give her sister-in-law money as it isnt her problem to take care of, and we also have plans of getting engaged this upcoming year. She should be saving that money for our relationship as that's what I have primarily been focusing on.

My GF is now upset that I'm being ""stingy"" with her family, and sees this as a ""red flag"".

However, I'm starting to think that she's the redflag as her family has been really dependant on her money. I don't want my possible future family to be financially responsible for fully capable adults. 

I suggested that her older brother should deal with his wife's issue and not her. Am I wrong for this?

Tl;dr: Told GF not to financially support her sister-in-law and to focus more on our relationship. Gf is now upset that I'm being ""stingy""."
