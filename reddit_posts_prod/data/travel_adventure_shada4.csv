Experience travel in the US - long weekend adventure,Tallen_,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/shada4/experience_travel_in_the_us_long_weekend_adventure/,10,2,"My best friend and I have a long weekend available in March (Thurs - Sunday) that we want to use to take a quick trip. We have seen most of the major cities in the US (also we are based in Atlanta), so we are interested in experiencing something new - whether it be seeing something really unique, doing an interesting activity, etc. 

As an example, I have never seen Niagara Falls, so that would constitute a unique experience to me. Unfortunately, she has been there several times having grown up in the North East. 

Our budget is roughly $300 or less for flight, and about $800 total for lodging. Does anyone have any suggestions for a weekend getaway with an interesting/unique experience? 

Appreciate the help!"
