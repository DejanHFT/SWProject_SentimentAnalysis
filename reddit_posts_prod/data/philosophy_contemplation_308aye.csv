"Kierkegaard, Beauty, and the Neighbor",ConclusivePostscript,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/308aye/kierkegaard_beauty_and_the_neighbor/,2,53,"Kierkegaard does not often speak on the subject of beauty. His remarks on the subject are sporadic and undeveloped, and it is difficult to tell how determinate a concept of beauty he may have had. Yet we can piece together a few conceptual “fragments” from the two works in which he and his pseudonyms seem to touch on it at most length—*Either/Or* and *Works of Love*.

In Book I of *Either/Or*, the anonymous aesthete (“A”) has little to say about beauty. But we do find some direct remarks in its final piece, “The Seducer’s Diary.” Johannes the Seducer, who represents the diabolical extreme of the aesthetic life-view, writes: “Woman still is and will continue to be an inexhaustible subject for contemplation for me… What is glorious and divine about aesthetics is that it is associated only with the beautiful; essentially it deals only with belles lettres and the fair sex” (p. 428, Hongs’ translation, changing “esthetics” and its cognates to “aesthetics” here and hereafter).

In Book II, Judge William, representative of the “ethical” life, responds—not to the Seducer directly, but to A. He attributes to A both the view that life “loses its beauty” the very moment “the ethical is advanced” and *the definition of the beautiful* as “that which has its teleology within itself” (p. 272). A’s typical examples, according to the Judge, are a young girl, nature, and works of art and poetry. But the Judge objects. He reasons that teleology implies movement, and each of these *lack* movement. For “the beauty in nature simply *is*, and if I behold a work of art and interpenetrate its thought with my own thought, it is really in me that the movement takes place, not in the work of art” (p. 274). As for a young girl, she is beautiful not *qua* girl but only considered from the standpoint of freedom. What kind of freedom? The kind that belongs to *all* human beings as such (cf. p. 177). The kind that is expressed in a person’s “inner teleology” wherein “his [or her] movement becomes a movement from himself through the world to himself,” and in which “the individual comes to stand higher than every relationship” (pp. 274-75).

The Judge continues at length: “When I look at life ethically, I look at it according to its beauty. Life then becomes rich in beauty for me, not impoverished in beauty, as it actually is for you. I do not need to travel all over the country to find beauties or to rake about for them in the streets; I do not need to assess and sort out. … If at times I have a free hour, I stand at my window and look at people, and I see each person according to his beauty. However insignificant he may be, however humble, I see him according to his beauty, for I see him as this individual human being who nevertheless is also the universal human being. I see him as one who has this concrete task for his life; even if he is the lowliest hired waiter, he does not exist for the sake of any other person. He has his teleology within himself, he actualizes this task, he is victorious…” (p. 275).

On the Judge’s view, then, beauty is properly seen and understood from the vantage of the ethical life, not the aesthetic, and this is because beauty belongs not primarily to “aesthetics” or “the fair sex,” or to art or nature, but to human beings in their freedom, their existential strivings, their individualization of human universality.

For Kierkegaard himself, however, both views miss the mark (though the Judge’s approaches closer to the truth). In *Works of Love*, Kierkegaard writes from the standpoint of Christianity’s revelation of the nature of genuine love (see pp. 24-25, 27), and this in turn has consequences for our conception of the beautiful:

“What then is meant by *the beautiful*? *The beautiful* is the immediate and direct object of immediate love, the choice of inclination and of passion. Surely there is no need to command that one shall love the beautiful. But the ugly! This is not anything to offer inclination and passion, which turn away and say, ‘Is that anything to love!’ And what, in turn, is *the beautiful* according to our [human] conceptions of love? It is the beloved and the friend. The beloved and the friend are the immediate and direct objects of immediate love, the choice of passion and of inclination. And what is *the ugly*? It is the *neighbor*, whom one **shall** love. … true love is love for the neighbor, or it is not to find the lovable object but to find the un-lovable object lovable” (pp. 373-4, emphasis in original).

Now, this may seem at first glance to imply an *opposition* of the beautiful and commanded neighbor-love. But for Kierkegaard, to “love without passion is an impossibility” (p. 50). Our immediate inclinations and passions are not to be *destroyed* or *abolished* but “dethroned” (p. 45; cf. pp. 61-2) and “transform[ed]” (p. 139). And it is precisely through acknowledging the category of the neighbor, and our inexhaustible duty to love our neighbor, that such a transformation occurs. Neighbor-love finds the unlovable object lovable—finds the ugly object beautiful.

This biblical category functions not unlike another biblical notion—the *imago Dei*. Being the neighbor is “eternity’s mark—on every human being,” the “common watermark” which is seen “only by means of eternity’s light when it shines through the dissimilarity” of this particular person and that one (p. 89). When we compare this to the Judge’s notion that there is something intrinsically beautiful in all human beings, something that transcends any and all worldly differences, it becomes even clearer that Kierkegaard is not, strictly speaking, opposing the beautiful, but opening the curtains to let new light fall on it.

Much as Christ, then, in the parable of the Good Samaritan, transforms strategically evasive questions into unexpected imperatives (cf. pp. 20-22, 95-8), here Kierkegaard allows the Gospel to trap his readers in a similar fashion. If for Christ “Who is my neighbor?” becomes “You yourself go and *be* the neighbor,” then for Kierkegaard “What is beauty and where can I find it?” is met with “You already *know* what it is; now diligently *seek it out*.”

Kierkegaard’s tacit identification of the beautiful with eternity’s “common watermark” has a further significance. This identification allows him to preserve, in effect, the definition of beauty that the Judge had apparently assimilated from A (despite the Judge’s disagreements as to its interpretation and application). Beauty therefore remains “that which has its teleology within itself.” For although Kierkegaard is more explicit about the God-given nature of this teleology than the Judge, thus tying human teleology to something (someone) extrinsic, he is no less adamant than the Judge that *what is* God-given is *part of the individual human being’s essential nature*. It is, then, at once extrinsic *qua* gift and intrinsic *qua* possession. It is God who creates, but the existential capacity to become “spirit” is the given *creaturely nature* of all human beings (cf. pp. 56-7, 209-10; cf. *JP* 1: 67 and *The Sickness Unto Death*, passim).
