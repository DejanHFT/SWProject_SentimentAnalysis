Ethics of Abortion,allURboozeRbelong2us,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/zmth2/ethics_of_abortion/,256,40,"I wasn't sure exactly where I should post this, but I think this is a broad enough subreddit to get enough attention.

I was reading “The Better Angels Of Our Nature” by Steven Pinker and came across a quote from the English physician, Charles Mercier, who was presenting arguments in favor of infanticide. While we now can refute many of his points concerning infanticide, I thought this quote could also be applied to abortion, and I was curious as to your thoughts.

“The victim’s mind is not sufficiently developed to enable it to suffer from the contemplation of approaching suffering or death. It is incapable of feeling fear or terror. Nor is its consciousness sufficiently developed to enable it to suffer pain in appreciable degree. Its loss leaves no gap in any family circle, deprives no children of their breadwinner or their mother, no human being of a friend, helper, or companion.” –Charles Mercier, 1911.
