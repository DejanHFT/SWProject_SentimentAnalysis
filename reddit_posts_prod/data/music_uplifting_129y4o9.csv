Emotional/uplifting piano song used on tv programs such as BBC sport’s personality of the year.,NPM2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/129y4o9/emotionaluplifting_piano_song_used_on_tv_programs/,1,1,"Looking for a piano song that I heard a snippet of today that i forgot about and really like. It’s a simple piano song which is quite emotive and so has often been used as backing music to BBC SPOTY intros etc.. it’s a fairly modern song from what I remember and doesn’t have any words, just some piano chords that are quite melodic, emotive yet fairly simply.. help, it’s really bugging me!?"
