Any ideas on how to achieve my running goal? 2.4km in under 10:21,Phospholipids,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/q6n9l/any_ideas_on_how_to_achieve_my_running_goal_24km/,37,23,"I have a fitness test coming up and I need to run 2.4km (1.5 miles) uner 10:21, i have about 6 months to train for this.

What's the most efficient way of hitting this goal? what kind of training should i do? 

I'm not a very fit person in terms of cardio, i haven't run in over half a year thanks to the winter here in the south of Sweden. But i figured that since winter is pretty much over, i can start running again. My last timing was about 11:30 for 2.4km. I need to shave over a minute from this. 

Some help from you guys here would be nice :) 

edit: you guys are all awesome, TIL about r/running. Most of you guys seem to be recommending interval trainings, will definitely try it out. Unfortunately i don't have access to a gym nor hilly areas but would love to if i do find an area. And yeah, i'm training for military. Thanks everyone!
