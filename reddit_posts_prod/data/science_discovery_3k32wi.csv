"American Chemical Society AMA Series: I'm Mark Blaskovich, from Open Antimicrobial Drug Discovery. We help chemists around the world discover new antibiotics, ask me anything about antimicrobial resistance, the empty antibiotic discovery pipeline and the ‘superbug’ crisis. AMA!",AmerChemSocietyAMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3k32wi/american_chemical_society_ama_series_im_mark/,674,3611,"Hi Reddit! I’m Mark Blaskovich, the Program Coordinator for Hit Validation & Chemistry for the Community for Open Antimicrobial Drug Discovery (CO-ADD, see www.co-add.org). I’m also a Senior Research Officer at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at The University of Queensland in Australia. The goal of CO-ADD is to empower the community of synthetic chemists to discover new antibiotics. We provide free screening against five bacteria and two fungi, and are actively seeking out compounds to test from chemists around the world. Any compounds that show activity undergo further assays, and all the results are the property of the compound submitter.
 
My background is medicinal chemistry – I got my PhD in synthetic chemistry developing syntheses of unusual amino acids, and published a book on amino acid synthesis (Handbook on Syntheses of Amino Acids, Oxford University Press). I worked for ten years for a couple of biotech companies in Seattle, a peptidomimetic company developing GPCR ligands and protease inhibitors (Molecumetics) and a company focused on protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (CEPTYR).  I then crossed the ocean to become Chief Operating Officer at Mimetica (Australia), where I managed the drug discovery and development program for melanocortin-5 receptor antagonists. This work led to a compound currently in Phase II human trials for the treatment of acne. Since 2010 I’ve been working at The University of Queensland, developing new antibiotics to treat drug resistant pathogens and helping to set up CO-ADD. I’ll be giving a talk about CO-ADD and our antibiotic discovery efforts at the [C&EN virtual symposium on Advances in Drug Discovery and Development on Sept 16](http://engage.vevent.com/index.jsp?eid=782&seid=1319&code=CENEmail1).
 
**I will be back at 5 pm ET (2 pm PT, 9 pm UTC, 7 am in Queensland!)**  Please AMA about CO-ADD, and what you can do to help to discover new antibiotics!

Hi all, I'm online now and will start answering questions. I see there's a lot of interest already, which is fantastic. If I don't get to your question during this session, I'll come back to it later today (it's bright and early in Australia now)!  MB 

Hi again - thanks for all your questions. Unfortunately I have to check out, but I''ll be back in a couple of hours and keep working my way through, so please check back to see if your question has been answered. Also, please watch my presentation next week at the [C&EN virtual symposium on Advances in Drug Discovery and Development on Sept 16](http://engage.vevent.com/index.jsp?eid=782&seid=1319&code=CENEmail1) to learn more about CO-ADD and how you can help discover the next antibiotic.  Bye! Mark"
