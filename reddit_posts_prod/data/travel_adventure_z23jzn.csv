Magical November in Tunisia. North African Adventure,_Eviltwin_5,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/z23jzn/magical_november_in_tunisia_north_african/,3,35," 

After having been to Morocco and Egypt, I decided to explore the last North African country that grants me (EU citizen) a visa on arrival. Will see about Algeria and Libya in the future, due to safety concerns and annoying visa applications. Surprisingly, this might have been the overall cheapest and safest among North African destinations so far.

The **flight** from Strasbourg, France to Tunis with the well, underwhelming, national airline, was around 90 Euro, luggage, softdrink and sandwich included. The planes were rather old, one of them very dirty, the other one in decent conditions. Being used to Ryanair, this was not too bad, at least I had reclining seats. I expected much worse from having read other travelers' reports. My luggage wasn't wrapped in plastic, unlike many of the other travelers, but nothing was stolen or damaged. Electronics were kept in the hand luggage, of course. On my return flight, Tunisair let me take 2 kg overweight without batting an eye. The airline was late 20 minutes on both ways, but this is North Africa after all, not Switzerland.

Tunisian tourism infrastructure seems focused on **all-inclusive** tourism. Expect tacky offers. I used the english 2012 Lonely Planet guide to navigate interesting sites and was more satisfied than with the 2022 german Marco Polo.  
I like being comfortable during my vacations. In Morocco, I had mixed experiences, spending 35-50 Euro/night for riyadhs and wanted something a bit cleaner and comfy this time.  
The **hotels** in the capital were rather pricey, we stayed a night in the Belvedere Fourati, the best stay during the Tunsia trip, but also the most expensive with 72 Euro for a double room (at least we got a suite upgrade). Taking advantage of the established hotel industry, we managed to get half board deals at different Iberostars in Djerba and Sousse for around 40-50 Euro/night for 2 people, which I consider great value. We also stayed a night in the desert in Ksar Ghilane at the Diar Ghilane, facing the desert, for around 50 Euro half board (bring a towel). Considering it is in the middle of nowhere, the infrastructure of the hotel was great, but keep your expectations realistic! The only water source is loaded with sulfur and Originally we were going to stay in Camp Zmela but got stuck in the sand with our car and couldn't reach them by phone, so we were helped by the local Gendarme quickly and professionally.  
I came across Ksar Jouamaa, located on a hill, in a fascinating star wars like ancient structure, which hosts cozy and renovated rooms with private showers and a shared toilet. The food, view and vibes were fantastic, I wish we had time to spend a night. Half board around 160TD/47 Euro. It was quiet and overlooking a great valley, felt very authentic.

To have a more adventurous experience, I advise bringing or renting a **car** and getting a good insurance, Tunisians are not exactly safe drivers. The rentals and gas are cheaper than in Morocco. We did not have any accidents nor witnessed them. Fuel was inexpensive compared to Europe, around 70 Euro cents per liter. LPG/Autogas is cheaper, but not the easiest to find, some Agil stations had it. There are many road checks for Tunisian license plates, while foreign license plates are virtually invisible to most cops in the north. Many checks to get into Djerba and some along the way in the south, keep your passport ready. Tunisia suffers from occasional fuel shortages, close to border regions you will find lots of smuggled Algerian and Libyan fuel being sold at the side of the roads. Other road shopping includes fruits, date wine (in the south), baskets, pottery, and dates.

As a female traveler, I got a lot less **harassment** in Tunisia than Morocco (medium with one case of ass grabbing) and Egypt (this was the worst destination for harassment out of 35 countries I visited). In Kairouan there was lots of aggressive selling and some staring, few comments in arabic. In El Jem I was stared at by every single man despite long sleeves and long pants, this was very uncomfortable. Tunis, Sousse and Djerba were chill and I didn't feel out of place. The Medina of Tunis was almost dead at night, so I'd avoid it if you are alone. In Ksar Ghilane they were used to tourists, but I got some stares from people and kids for putting my half uncovered legs up in the car on the way there. Desert towns like Gabes were conservative.  
**Temperatures in November** were between 13 degrees at night and 27 during the day on warm days. Bring both long flowy clothes for conservative, warm cities and regular jeans or dresses for liberal places. I only wore bikinis at the hotel, got some negligible looks by employees. The Ksar Ghilane thermal source should also be fine. I would personally avoid shorts because it would feel out of place in November, while Tunisians wear warm jackets even under the sun. As soon as the sun goes down, after 5 p.m., it will get cold. It will get especially cold in the desert and badly isolated desert hotels or tents. Bring a jacket with you for evenings pretty much anywhere.

**Tunisian Food** in three words: Fried. Spicy. Eggs.  
The food was very tasty. I ate street food several times and had no trouble with my stomach. Still, I avoided fresh salads. Absolutely loved the Brik, especially the one in the jewish neighborhoods of Djerba and in Ksar Joumaa. If you like spicy, try Keftaji. Couscous was good but I preferred the one from Marrakesh (not trying to start couscous wars here, just my personal experience). Coffee was terrible in most places, I advise bringing your own or switching to tea.

**Activities and museums** close early in winter, around 5 p.m. or earlier, plan accordingly. Google maps hours are often inaccurate or display summer opening hours. Google reviews for hotels and restaurants can also be wildly inaccurate, due to religious or personal differences - some hotels had bad ratings for not allowing burkinis, while otherwise being perfectly good, while other people were upset at very decent pubs for not letting them in.

**Drinks** are sold in hotels, some restaurants and bigger supermarkets. Tunisian wine was underwhelming or sadly terrible and pricey. It is not sold on fridays in stores.

**My Itinerary**

Day 1 (Friday)  
I arrived late and had dinner at [**Utopia**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qPVbsvJ1Eewd3RWHA) **in Gammarth**, a hip place with many young people and the best wine I had in Tunisia. I enjoyed the spicy Keftaji a lot! There are nightlife offers and clubs in the area if you like that. As always in Tunisia, don't forget to pay the parking guy. We drove to our hotel in Sousse afterwards to rest.

Day 2  
We visited the **Sousse Medina**, wandered around the markets, visited the **Ribat** and bought a handmade jacket for about 30 Euro after some haggling (they put zippers on it if you like, take advantage of the customization). My personal highlight was the **Sousse Archeological Museum**, which hosts an amazing collection of mosaics, roman and punic artefacts in good condition. I highly recommend it. We had lunch at the [BBQ Kantaoui](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qPVbsvJ1Eewd3RWHA)

between old planes and a helicopter wrack. At night our hotel had a sufi whirling dance show.

Day 3  
We took this day to relax and spa. My skin has never been softer than after the hammam scrub. We had lunch at the [Al Ghazali Grill](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zctCFfPe5zeY9HPL8)

. Later, we visited the Sousse Marina and bought some wine at the local supermarket.

Day 4  
We visited the 4th holiest city in Islam, Kairouan, with its mosques and mausoleums. Beware of unwanted pushy guides that take you to ""carpet museums"" and other non commercial sounding places that turn out to be shops. You will end up in a government owned carpet shop sooner or later, and you might buy an overpriced carpet. I ended up buying a wool rug at the [House of the Governor](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zsDCdxfvtY7KmyBL9)

, a very pretty former government official house, now carpet shop, ask to see the rooftop and don't forget to haggle, a lot.  
Sights in Kairouan include the **Great Mosque**, the Mosque of the three doors, the mausoleoum of Sidi Abid El Ghariani and the **Bir Barrouta** well with miraculous water drawn by a camel. I was kind of fed up with the aggressive selling after a few hours and skipped the Basins of Aghlabides, as well as the Zaouia of Sidi Sahabi and the Islamic Art Museum in Raqqada. On the way out, we bought some (1 kg) of the famous and delicious sweets of Kairouan.

In need of some roman history, we drove off to El Jem, where the third-largest [**Roman Amphitheater**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Amphitheater+of+El+Jem/@35.2964821,10.7069003,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xf56c08802fb823a8?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjIrfTqt8L7AhXKhv0HHRjPCRsQ_BJ6BQiaARAI)

in the world has survived the millennia. Absolutely do not miss out on this, it's very impressive and a lot less visited than the Colosseum, allowing you to explore each floor of the structure and get lost in it. We had a tasty streetfood called Brik (fried crispy dough with tuna, runny egg, potato and harissa) nearby. Afterwards, we went for a quick visit to the [Archeological Museum of El Jem](https://goo.gl/maps/5Vy5xh3rMqnfL6BYA) to see one of the rare mosaics of the [Goddess Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa_(goddess)#:~:text=Goddess%20Africa%2C%20also%20known%20as,military%20standard%2C%20and%20a%20lion), in the outside structure of the museum, covered in dust. The conditions roman mosaics are kept in Tunisia is often a sad sight. Some of the mosaics were on the floor, exposed to the elements, with people stepping on them.

Walking in El Jem was a particularly uncomfortable experience as every single man was staring at me despite long clothes.

Day 5  
This morning was dedicated to the myth of the former president Habib Bourgiba in his city **Monastir**. We visited the [Bourgiba Presidential Palace Museum](https://goo.gl/maps/fjiDuwNixtovmDFMA)

and the [Borguiba Mausoleum](https://goo.gl/maps/KDtMDLEEw1mokmk9A), where I was suprisingly let in with a short skirt. His ideology as the ""liberator of women"" must have had a great impact here. His palace was kept in a fancy western 1960s style, with electric blinds, an old mercedes and the rooms he used to live in with his wife and adoptive daughter, including a gallery of photos with famous political figures and gifts from different countries. It gives a glimpse into what his life must have been like. The structure of his mausoleum is also very impressive and displays a completely different, islamic, style.

We stopped in Gabes for some shawarma and continued our drive to **Ksar Ghilane**.  
Sadly we got stuck in the sand and had to call the Gendarme, which recommended us to stay in the Hotel Ghilane, as they thought it was too cold for tents - they were right. (It was completely our fault as we trusted another traveler's feedback about being able to reach Camp Zmela by car and decided to try.) Our dinner at the hotel was pleasant, some brik, fries, chicken and dates. We managed to sit on the dunes for some **star gazing** and watched the moon go up, nights in the desert are incredibly beautiful and the stars shine as bright as I never see them anywhere else. It's a magical experience to enjoy with some Amazigh music (I like [Tinaweren](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ3wH-v5zOcq4ZZWI58TGKA)

) and warm clothes, as the desert gets freezing at night. You will see a lot of tacky cultural appropriation of Berber/Amazigh culture here and elsewhere, just be aware it is not often authentic.

Day 6  
Woke up early after a cool night to see the sunrise in the **desert**, then walked to the thermal water source where some tourists were swimming. We rented a quad and a guide to ride to the Ksar (berber granary also used as roman fortress) of Ksar Ghilane, in the middle of the warm sandy dunes. From there you have a stunning view of the desert and can admire an old roman inscription in the Ksar.  
The Quad managed to burn my poliesther pants, make sure to wear something resistant and wrapping a cloth around ur head is recommended to minimize inhaling dust. The sand in this desert is as pretty as it is fine and will get everywhere, socks, lungs, hair.

On the way back we checked if some sites mentioned in my 2012 guide were still visitable: Ksar Tarcine and Bir soltane are not reachable by car and the Bir Soltane Cafe seems to have closed down. The gas stations on the map do not exist, there are closed down wooden booths which used to sell gasoline in plastic tanks. Make sure to have a full tank before riding there. Often there will not be many gas stations on the way, especially in the South.

We managed to visit the fantastic [**Ksar Jouamaa**](https://goo.gl/maps/xWai7a7prwdVCBBz8)

and have a very tasty lunch with a stunning view there. I wish we knew about this place earlier and had booked a night here. There was almost no one there, it felt very peaceful after a night with the whirring of the diesel generator in Ksar Ghilane. The owner and his business partner were very friendly and helpful. This is my new happy place, remote, quiet and with positive vibes. The wide view over the valley is incredible.  
We also visited Ksar Hallouf on the way, which was more touristic (charging highly for drinks and toilets) and had a nice view over the palms in the valley.

Another improvised stop on the way to Djerba was the [**Gigthis Archeological Site**](https://goo.gl/maps/Wrat2S4iAxx1QL6w7)

, one of the least visited sites in the country, a crime not to come here. It is a huge roman city with temples, a port, bathhouses, a forum, an arch, etc. and there is almost no one visiting. There are mosaics exposed to the elements, partially uncovered, partially covered by earth, completely accessible. Many mosaic pieces and other roman fragments, vase parts, etc. lay around. It is a dream and a nightmare at the same time for anyone interested in archeology or roman history. Another very sad example for the neglect of Roman Sites in Tunisia.

There were many police stops on the way to the island from the bridge (originally there was a roman construction), this slowed us down a little. We had dinner at our Iberostar in Djerba and enjoyed the comfort of modernity.

Day 7  
One of the special things about Djerba, along with the Ibadi faith group, is the presence of a Jewish community since antiquity. This day was dedicated to discovering some of the jewish sites of the island. We went for some souk shopping, fixed my burnt pants at a tailor and talked to some of the jewish jewelers in the **Houmt Souq**. We also checked out the pretty **Hara Seghira** neighborhood with its beautiful wall art & flowers, and peaked into the windows of an abandoned Yeshiva (jewish religious school). There we had lunch at one of the kosher street food restaurants, the [Warda Resto Djerbahood](https://www.instagram.com/wardarestodjerbahood/)

. We tried a variety of things and they were all incredibly tasty, do not miss out on the brik and kefta!

We dropped off our dusty desert laundry at a ""Pressing"" in the neighborhood to pick it up the next day, they did a great job and charged way less than the hotel - still not little.

The **El Ghriba Synagogue** is a sight you will read about in most Djerba guides. I was surprised to have to take my shoes off and cover my head, as this is unusual for jewish temples, but this particular one is deemed to have a special holiness due to being either constructed with part of the old Jerusalem temple or other legends surrounding it.

We decided to skip hotel dinner and have a bbq in the active jewish neighborhood of **Hara Kebira**, in a [street full of local restaurants](https://goo.gl/maps/3K2zP3iNf43QKAeRA)

. I highly recommend the home made merguez and brochette. Something special in this neighborhood are the many blue wall paintings of a version of the amazigh ""yaz"" reinterpreted to look like menorahs on both ends. It is a very non-touristic neighborhood most of the year and safe after dark.

Day 8  
We picked up our laundry and had lunch at the Hara Seghira again, the Brik was addictive. We went for a quick stop at the Souq and then straight to the beach to enjoy the warmth. Even after dark, at 10 p.m., I managed to have a night swim in the crystalline water.

Day 9  
We relaxed at the hotel a bit, then visited the Guellala Museum (Cultural heritage museum). It was overall interesting and helped me understand local culture better. I think it closes at 18:00, the website says 20:00.

Day 10  
The drive to Tunis was long. We left early and had late lunch in Sidi Bou Said, at Chez Weld Moufida. We watched the sunset near the punic ports and ventured into the medina at night. It was very dead, except for a street well visited by young locals, where we had a tea. We also managed to see the [Ez-Zeitouna Mosque](https://goo.gl/maps/218WtL1ZfoxbQcTVA)

's courtyard with its roman columns. I would not venture here alone at night.

We spent the night at the Belvedere Hotel, which was excellent.

Last Day  
We ditched the overpriced hotel breakfast and went to [**Punic Art**](https://goo.gl/maps/PGZpDBRcTpZGXXpk6)

instead to enjoy a magical seaview and a huge breakfast for 30TD for both, right next to the Punic Ports. This was the perfect way to start the day and say goodbye to Tunisia and its sea.  
We managed to see some of old Carthage, visit the Punic Ports and the Tophet Sanctuaries. Carthage Museum was mostly closed, we got to see some ruins, but by far not as impressive as Gigthis! The nearby cathedral was closed, we still enjoyed seeing its architecture from outside.  
There can be traffic to the airport, so start early."
