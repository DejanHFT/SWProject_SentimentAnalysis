Why did Polynesians inhabit isolated islands with no significant resources?,raptorman556,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6bixx5/why_did_polynesians_inhabit_isolated_islands_with/,764,4849,"The most prominent example I can think of is [Henderson Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson_Island_%28Pitcairn_Islands%29?wprov=sfla1).  It has no significant resources, and even today its uninhabitated.  I've seen plenty of other islands like this too.  I can see no point in setting up a colony here, but they did.  So why did the Polynesians, and other groups, set up these seemingly pointless and difficult settlements?

EDIT:  A second island of the like that has been brought up in the comments is [Anuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anuta).  I've seen some good answers on Henderson, but I'm hope to get some good insight on why Polynesians settled on such resource-poor islands *in general*, not just these specific islands."
