Quentin Tarantino's 'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood' - Review Thread,BunyipPouch,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/brg7cc/quentin_tarantinos_once_upon_a_time_in_hollywood/,596,1636,"Tarantino's *Once Upon A Time In Hollywood* just premiered at Cannes tonight and reviews are starting to come out. They're realllllllly good so far and this sounds like it's gonna be another QT classic. He'll once again have the buzziest/most-hyped title out of Cannes. Probably an early front-runner for the Best Picture Oscar next year and many are comparing it to his best work. Also reports of 5+ minute ovations but that's not exactly groundbreaking at Cannes lol. Many calling it Tarantino's funniest film so far and one of Pitt's best performances.

**Rotten Tomatoes Score**: [94% - 8.12 Average Rating - 32 Reviews](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/once_upon_a_time_in_hollywood)

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/21/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-tarantino-dazzling-dicaprio-pitt)

> Five Stars. Quite simply, I just defy anyone with red blood in their veins not to respond to the crazy bravura of Tarantino’s film-making, not to be bounced around the auditorium at the moment-by-moment enjoyment that this movie delivers. 

[Cine Vue](https://cine-vue.com/2019/05/cannes-2019-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review.html)

> Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is bold, beautiful and brutal. It’s Tarantino’s best film since Kill Bill, perhaps even since Pulp Fiction. 

[Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/upon-time-hollywood-review-tarantinos-ode-pre-manson-la-pure/)

> There’s a gleeful toxicity here that will launch a thousand think-pieces – Pitt’s character is capital-P problematic, absolutely by design – but the transgressive thrill is undeniable, and the artistry mesmerisingly assured.

[Screendaily](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/once-upon-a-time--in-hollywood-cannes-review/5139676.article)

> Once Upon A Time….in Hollywood is beautifully made. Beyond all the ‘Tarantino-esque’ touches of the action, the banter, the violence, the constant movie references, there’s a real craft at play here. Quentin Tarantino’s ninth film is a visceral, expertly-crafted homage to the Hollywood’s heyday. 

[BirthMoviesDeath](https://birthmoviesdeath.com/2019/05/21/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-tarantino-leaves-tinseltown-burning-in) 

> Tarantino Leaves Tinseltown Burning In His Wake. It’s the end of an era, and QT plans on going out in a blaze of glory.

[Indiewire](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/05/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-quentin-tarantino-1202143431/) 

> Quentin Tarantino’s Weirdest Movie Gets Lost in History. Tarantino's ninth feature is a hangout movie that takes a liberal approach to Hollywood history.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/cannes-film-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-quentin-tarantino-brad-pitt-leonardo-dicaprio-1203222012/) - Spoiler warning, probably.

> DiCaprio and Pitt fill out their roles with such rawhide movie-star conviction that we’re happy to settle back and watch Tarantino unfurl this tale in any direction he wants.\

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-cannes/)

> All the Tarantino hallmarks are here - the jet-black humour, fine-tuned dialogue, jukebox soundtrack and, yes, bare feet.

[The Standard UK](https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/film/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-cannes-2019-a4142946.html)

> If not a career best, it's an extraordinary career summation.

[Collider](http://collider.com/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review/)

> Pitt and DiCaprio Set Tarantino’s Fairy Tale Ablaze.  Tarantino,  has never made a film that ends up as sweet and nostalgic as his latest, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.

[Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/05/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-quentin-tarantino-brad-pitt-leonardo-dicaprio?verso=true)

> This curious fairy tale may not be the truth, and it may prattle on too long. But when its stars align, and they let loose with their unmistakable shine, Hollywood movies do seem truly special again.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-film-review-a-contemplative-quentin-tarantino-still-blows-the-roof-off-cannes/)

> It's a grand playground for the director to further fetishize old pop culture, to break things and hurt people, and to bring a wide-eyed glee and a robust sense of perversity to the whole craft of moviemaking.
