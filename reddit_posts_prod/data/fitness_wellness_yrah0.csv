Note to people keeping track of their calories (applies to macros as well),mrnotoriousman,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/yrah0/note_to_people_keeping_track_of_their_calories/,29,50,"I've been getting much more strict on my calories and diet in general recently, and one thing that I have noticed is that the nutrition labels on many foods can be misleading. 

For example, my jar of peanuts has a serving size of 28g(about 1/4 cup).  For a while I was eating 1/2 cup at as a snack and counting it as 2 servings, but when I went and actually weighed it out, 1/2 cup was about 75 grams.  The same thing happened with various other foods such as my turkey sausages were actually 25% bigger than the estimated serving size on the package, slices of bread were much more, etc.

This is mostly relevant to people who are on a deficit and are thinking they are eating x amount of calories and then wondering why they aren't losing weight, but variations of 20%-30% in what you're eating can really alter your macros a lot.  Kitchen scales are fairly cheap and after a while you don't really need to use it as much because you can just eyeball the foods that you eat every day (I still weigh everything, but after 8 weeks I come extremely close with my estimates anyways)"
