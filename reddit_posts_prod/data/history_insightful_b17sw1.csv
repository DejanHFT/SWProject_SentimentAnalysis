It seems like both the UK and France were unprepared for WW2. France was conquered by 1940 and the UK were dependent on the US for supplies and arms despite an empire. Why were the British and French militaries underprepared while the Nazis appeared to take on the world?,Tmclaughlin8407,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/b17sw1/it_seems_like_both_the_uk_and_france_were/,43,5,"Why were the British and French militaries underprepared for defense while Nazi Germany was more than prepared for global warfare? 
What led to the UK being dependent on the support of the USA leading to the Land Lease Act and such? The economies of Europe were all hurting yet Germany was still able to produce a massive military despite the Versailles Treaty and reluctant Allies . Churchill becoming PM certainly helped get England resist Hitler and rally his people.  Thanks, Iâ€™d appreciate your time and insight "
