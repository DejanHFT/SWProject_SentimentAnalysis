Games that have ruined their genres forever?,thewalkindude,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17vmgcn/games_that_have_ruined_their_genres_forever/,1366,1678,"I was playing the 2016 version of Master of Orion, and it's a perfectly fine game, something akin to Civilization in space, it's just not nearly as complex or interesting as Stellaris. Stellaris has created the ultimate space strategy game, and keeps adding new mechanics and features. I don't really see why anyone would need to make a space strategy game again."
