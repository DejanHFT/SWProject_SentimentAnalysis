Reviews:

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/oct/26/five-nights-at-freddys-review-halloween)

>A competently made yet maddeningly dull attempt to bring the hit video game to the big screen makes for an instantly forgettable night at the movies.

[Ign](https://www.ign.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-review)

>Slam the door on this animatronic monstrosity.

[Colider](https://collider.com/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-review/)

>There are moments where it feels like it could have become a more gleefully mean-spirited horror ride by really sinking its teeth into the story and acutally biting down, but it remains hamstrung by the rating as well as a lack of creativity.  
>  
>The film fails to capture the terror and simplicity that made the game successful, resulting in a forgettable and banal horror flick.

>The creatures—a motley, distressed-looking ensemble that resembles shipwreck survivors washed ashore from the island of misfit toys, or mangy mascots for teams playing in a *Twilight Zone* league—will be familiar to fans of the videogames. But everyone else will likely feel like they’re being introduced to murderous, mangy, misunderstood Muppets. Maybe that’s because they’re full-size creations designed by the late Muppet-master Jim Henson’s iconic puppetry company.  But I don’t remember Kermit the Frog ever opening his mechanized maw and chewing up someone’s face, *Saw*\-style.

>There are jump scares, but no real thrills. There are jokes, but no genuine laughs.

[Film Stories](https://filmstories.co.uk/reviews/five-nights-at-freddys-review-a-thoroughly-toothless-video-game-horror/)

>It’s an uninspired adaptation, afraid to break free from its source material but also unable to translate what makes the game compelling into cinematic form.

[Mark Reviews Movies](https://www.markreviewsmovies.com/reviews/F/fivenightsatfreddys.htm)

>It's not funny, despite a ridiculous and fairly clever gimmick, and it's definitely not scary.

>When 'The Banana Splits Movie' got there first, and did it slightly better, you’re in trouble."
