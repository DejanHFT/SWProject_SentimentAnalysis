Insomnia Editing Critique,tstepanski,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/m6ry3l/insomnia_editing_critique/,11,2,"Rewatching Insomnia (2002), I was really jarred by the conversation on the ferry. The constant cuts between the two and the obvious ADR/dubbing is terrible and very obvious. Iâ€™m convinced it was an availability/time-crunch thing between the two actors, but still. Otherwise, I love this movie. That one scene was a real suspension of belief for me this time around. Anyone else feel that way?"
