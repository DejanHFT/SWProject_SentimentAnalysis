How to not get too inspired?,spcbfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/15cu9fz/how_to_not_get_too_inspired/,1,0,"So I am planning an article about a big topic on my website, and I am now in the research phase, learning as much as I can about the topic, I've read books and and watched videos and all is good.

up until I watched this video about the topic that is so good that I can't stop thinking about it, and I feel like I want to structure my article like it (i.e. use the examples he used in the same order because his video strucutre kept me so engaging. but doing that would be cheap and unprofessional and of course unethical, so what can I do to make something that's relatively original?

This is precisely the reason why I sometimes avoid watching or reading similar articles about a topic I am writing about so that my work doesn't get too inspired from them, but since this is a deeply technical topic I couldn't help but do it"
