Blooket: Learning Reimagined,BlooketGodYT,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/tby8sc/blooket_learning_reimagined/,3,0,"Welcome to the World of Blooket: a new take on trivia and review games! ^((Kahoot but better))

  
The way it works is that a teacher/host picks a question set and a unique game mode. Then, we generate a code that players can use to join the game on their own devices. After the game starts, players will answer questions to help them win. Thatâ€™s where the fun starts, because we offer a variety of games to keep students engaged and excited!

At Blooket, we are striving to change the way students learn. While reading and studying an oversized textbook is certainly one option, we like to opt for a far more fun alternative. However, Blooket isn't just fun, it's also incredibly effective. By creating memorable experiences with classroom content, students learn the information without even noticing (and without paper cuts).
