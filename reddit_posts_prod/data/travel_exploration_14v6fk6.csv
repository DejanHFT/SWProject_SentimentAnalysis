Exploring the French Riviera without a car?,Geikamir,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/14v6fk6/exploring_the_french_riviera_without_a_car/,42,19,"Part of our trip to France will be around the coast, most likely (?) stationed in Nice for most/all of the time. We'll be in that area for about 6 days. I know that public transportation is great for getting around the major spots to hit, but how much of a challenge will it be to explore some of the hilltop villages like Grasse/Gourdon, St. Paul, etc? Should we rent a car or not? I've read that parking can be challenging in Nice, especially since we will be there at the busiest part of the year.

Should we plan to spend some nights further west from Nice, like Frejus/Saint Tropez or similar, to have easier access to these locations? 

Side question: Which of these places are your favorites that we should be sure to explore?


Thanks for your help!"
