Story is inspired but my words feel meh,Pangolin_Beatdown,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18zdwhq/story_is_inspired_but_my_words_feel_meh/,7,6,"My novel in progress is historical fiction set in a period I know a lot about. There's a story in my head that I've been evolving and telling for years for fun, and as a result I usually know exactly what scene comes next and why it's important. 

The problem is that sometimes because I know exactly what happens next, my writing feels perfunctory. Not always. Sometimes it sings, and that feels glorious. But sometimes it feels like I'm sitting down and writing out the facts as they occurred, like a homework assignment that's due tomorrow. 

Here's the scene that's triggered me, from yesterday. It's a dinner party that demonstrates how masterful her mother is at exercising power through clothing and environment, how different the two competing male protagonists are by having them respond differently to the same events, how lively and naive the protagonist is before the Terrible Thing happens, and that has her sing the song that will play a pivotal role in the plot much later when the Good Thing happens. It's a lot of weight to carry.

Well, it felt like I was writing a police report. The scene is so sparkling and delightful in my brain. Even as I was writing it, I could see and hear and smell it like I was there. Yet it felt lifeless as I laid it on the page. I sat down and wrote my words on schedule, which I know is great, but I almost feel like I should have waited until I felt more inspired.

I worry that because I know my characters and story so well I am missing out on the spontaneity a lot of writers seem to have with stories and characters that emerge as they write and ""tell their own stories.""

Is this a normal thing, that you sit down and write your words and it feels bleh and you don't know how to fix it? Am I having a feeling that other writers have when they have a fully plotted story? Can I fix it in editing? Should I just carry on and have faith it will all work out? I guess I'm looking for encouragement, but I'm open to criticism of my process as well.
