I miss the old PC strategy games,treemister1,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/urqhvp/i_miss_the_old_pc_strategy_games/,13,2,"Really feeling nostalgic and missing the old games like Warcraft 3 and Age of Empires. It's a shame no one really makes games like that anymore, as they were a huge part of my childhood. I feel like once blizzard decided they were done with it the whole genre just disappeared."
