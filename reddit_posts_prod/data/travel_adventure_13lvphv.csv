Suggestions for an adventurous late November trip.,YourLS,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/13lvphv/suggestions_for_an_adventurous_late_november_trip/,5,6,"We have about 10 days total, flying from Texas.

Looking for somewhere with nice weather, but not a strictly beach vacation.

Options we be come up with- Patagonia area, Chile/Argentina,
Nepal, Croatia, Egypt, Vietnam

Any suggestions?

Very adventurous travellers, don’t want to waste too much time with transit as we don’t have that many days.  Not interested in Italy, Spain, France, UK, typical European destinations, Costa Rica or Mexico.  Would love to do an African Safari but not sure if it is in our budget for this trip. 

We’ve done Belize, Guatemala, Equador, Jordan,  Panama, Japan, Morocco together.
Jordan and Guatemala were our favorite as they felt more off the beaten path and adventurous. 

I’ve been to S.Korea, most of SE Asia, China, Hong Kong, , Colombia, Brazil, a lot of Europe, South Africa."
