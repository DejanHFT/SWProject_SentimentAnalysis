UPDATE: Supporting my boyfriend has gotten me into debt and he can't pay me back,maximus_capacity,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/183gdpe/update_supporting_my_boyfriend_has_gotten_me_into/,52,527,"So, I ended things.

Thank you to everyone who commented on my last post and provided some clarity.

I feel pretty broken right now, but I know I'll be okay. It's been an incredible year of growth and transformation and I'm telling myself this was a necessary step to continue my journey to a better life. I haven't been single for a while so I'm really terrified of being alone.

I did get my money back. I asked him to take out a loan in his name and transfer the money to me. I did this first and most importantly to get my money back, but I also wanted to see how he would approach the debt if it officially belonged to him. He was in the process of selling some things to acquire the money to pay me back (after my endless 'nagging'), but I do think the process sped up and became more urgent. This said a lot to me about his priorities and disrespect regarding my finances.

The last straw was:

1. That he took out a phone contract for an iPhone 15 despite not having enough money to pay me back, but rather spending that money on a new device.
2. He conveniently remembered that he had 40% of what he owed me in a savings account that he's now withdrawn and putting towards his loan. This was after we had a conversation about a month ago about not putting anything towards savings until my debt was paid off. Even after this conversation, I found out that he put some money away and was upset about it because of our agreement. I wasn't putting money into savings because of this. He then transferred that money to me. I asked him a couple of days ago if he had any savings and he said no, only for this large sum of money to be revealed. I think he genuinely didn't have the thought to use this money to put towards my debt, but that's the whole point - lack of consideration.

Leading up to the breakup, I was thinking about what things are relationship essentials for me. I realised that too many of those boxes were unticked. The relationship was making me feel neglected, and disregarded, like I'm too much and annoying, unsupported, like I couldn't trust him, betrayed and like there was a breakdown of communication. These are all pillars of a good relationship for me.

I told him that I don't think he's ready for a serious committed relationship which means sharing your life with another person. I told him to go live for himself for a bit and experience not having to worry about anyone else but him. He agreed that he needs to go do some introspection and figure this out. He said he's really mad at himself for ruining this, but he understands where I'm coming from and hates that he's caused me pain which has pushed me to do this. He said he thinks that I deserve the best in life and he's sorry he couldn't step up to be that for me.

I don't think that he's a bad person or did any of this maliciously. I just don't think he's ready to be part of my team. Right now, I need to focus on myself and reach out for support.

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far.

TL;DR: We broke up after more developments, I got my money back and I'm hurting but I'll be okay.
