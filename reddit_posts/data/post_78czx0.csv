What are known technical hurdles that AlphaGo Zero would have to overcome before being able to play go on arbitrary graphs?,rpglover64,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/78czx0/what_are_known_technical_hurdles_that_alphago/,7,6,"[AlphaGo Zero](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/) recently demonstrated impressive success in AI by training a winning neural net from only self-play. I read somewhere (can't find the original source) that there is reason to be skeptical of how much of an advance this really is, since the resulting network won't be able to generalize its knowledge to even slightly different games, like ""go on an 18x18 board"". It seems like one possible next step is to fix the rules but to allow the topology to vary. My limited knowledge of neural nets suggests that this would be hard.

What are specific hurdles to constructing a neural net that can play go over arbitrary graphs (supplied at the beginning of game play)? What are avenues of exploration for overcoming them?"
