"During the 1930s, there was a race between British, Nazi, and American mountain climbers to summit one of the great peaks of the Himalayas. I just published a book about it. Ask me anything!",ScottEAuthor,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/f6v86f/during_the_1930s_there_was_a_race_between_british/,325,5973,"Greetings from Ann Arbor!  My name is Scott Ellsworth, and I am the author of THE WORLD BENEATH THEIR FEET: Mountaineering, Madness, and the Deadly Race to Summit the Himalayas, which was published this week by Little, Brown.   It's a book about obsession, courage, nationalism, tragedy, and triumph that takes places in the years just before and after World War II.  Set in India, Tibet, Nepal, England, Germany, Switzerland, and the United States, it tells the story of the largely forgotten men and women who tried to climb to the summits of some of the highest mountains on Earth, including Mount Everest, K2, and Nanga Parbat. 
 
I'm a writer and historian--and former climber--who spent four years researching this book on three different continents.  Please feel free to reach out, and I'll do my best to answer any questions about what I believe is one of the great lost adventure stories of the past hundred years.  Fire away!
