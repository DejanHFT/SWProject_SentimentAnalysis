Motivation to Get in the Gym,PennStateAlum8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3nlf1t/motivation_to_get_in_the_gym/,22,0,"I (M23) am overweight (5' 10"" and 271 lbs.) and it is starting to impact my health.  So recently I had a personal trainer build me a complete health plan.  He planned my daily diet as well as a work-out schedule. And I was excited to get started.  The diet lasted for a week and going to the gym didn't even last that long.  I am a full time college student and I work two jobs.  With all that going on I use my free time to relax on the couch instead of going to the gym.  My question is, where can I find motivation to lose weight instead of sitting on the couch? How do you guys do it?

tl;dr: I am busy and I can't find motivation to go to the gym in my free time."
