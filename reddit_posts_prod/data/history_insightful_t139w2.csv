About the recent events in Ukraine,creesch,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/t139w2/about_the_recent_events_in_ukraine/,14,1779,"Hi everyone, 

We are seeing a lot of posts in our moderation queue about the recent events unfolding in Ukraine. Which is understandable, however these still break our rules about modern politics and modern events. 
As this subreddit is not for discussion of current events and as there are other better suitable places on Reddit for that sort of discussion, we hope you do understand. 

Of course, it is still allowed to submit posts about the history of Ukraine, Russia, The Soviet Union, etc. as well as the relations between them in these periods. 

/r/AskHistorians also recognized that many people want to better understand the historical context of these events. They posted a [megathread about the recent events](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/t0gj2p/megathread_on_recent_events_in_ukraine/) which already contains a lot of great answers and insights from experts.


So to be clear: 

- Our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_rules) about modern day politics and current day events are still in place (Rule 2 and 5). 
- Posts that seek to understand the historic context of these events are still allowed (given they follow other rules as well)."
