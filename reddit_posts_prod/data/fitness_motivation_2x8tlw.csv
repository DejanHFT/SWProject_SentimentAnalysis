Newly found motivation...Running to Military cadence tracks.,urbngrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2x8tlw/newly_found_motivationrunning_to_military_cadence/,31,44,"I don't love running but I am training for a LEO PFT. Started running to boot camp chants and it has helped tremendously if for no other reason than that I'm focused on the pace/tempo and not how my legs feel. You can find the track on iTunes, spotify, etc."
