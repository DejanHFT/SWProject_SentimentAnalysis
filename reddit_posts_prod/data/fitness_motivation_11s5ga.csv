Motivation?,JZNelson,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/11s5ga/motivation/,19,1,"First time posting in /r/fitness. I'm not an unfit guy, a little muscular but not overly so. I'd like to get more of a physique going though. A six pack, better pecks, arms, and I'd like my legs to be proportional. No big top small bottom syndrome. My problem is I find exercise incredibly boring and can't stand to do it at times. Do you guys have any suggestions on how I can make it more enjoyable or a way to make me dislike it less? Thanks in advanced for all your advice!"
