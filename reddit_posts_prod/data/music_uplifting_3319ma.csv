Uplifting/Inspiring Scores?,poopoobagoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/3319ma/upliftinginspiring_scores/,4,5,"Looking for songs very similar to ""Rebirth"" by Two Steps from Hell. I am a filmmaker/screenwriter and ""Rebirth"" has sparked many ideas for me to write. It's extremely moody and inspirational. Anything else like this? I've given a lot of TSfH a listen to, and could only find a handful like that."
