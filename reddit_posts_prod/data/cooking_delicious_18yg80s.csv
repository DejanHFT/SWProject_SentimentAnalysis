Creative & Delicious Use of Stale Bread,pigsdoflyhigh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/18yg80s/creative_delicious_use_of_stale_bread/,94,132,"Thanks to this sub, I was given the idea of soaking my stale bread overnight in milk then pan frying it for a tasty breakfast. This tactic went above and beyond what I expected it would be. 

I had a loaf of sesame whole wheat bread from She Wolf (if you are in NYC, this is a must try bakery). Sadly, couldn’t eat it all in its rather short shelf life (the best bread doesn’t keep for long). I didn’t want to waste it, so I came here for advice. 

Long story short, I soaked the few slices that I could manage to break off the loaf in a whole milk egg mixture over night in the fridge and threw them on my carbon steel pan coated with butter this morning. Delicious breakfast. Still that savory eggy toast flavor that I was looking for. Thanks to this community for the brilliant idea. 

TLDR: stale bread soaked in milk and egg mixture overnight and pan fried in the morning makes a delicious breakfast."
