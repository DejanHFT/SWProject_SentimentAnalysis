You can literally mix anything into mayo and it tastes delicious,Mindless-Dependent27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/tadhop/you_can_literally_mix_anything_into_mayo_and_it/,88,80,"I just made some hot dogs and to spice it up I made some indian, mexican and chinese inspired ones. 
So to get the spices on there just mix anything with the mayo. Garam masala, cumin, curry powder, chili crisp everythings just delicious! 
Maybe that would work also with ketchup and Im just too into mayo but I doubt it"
