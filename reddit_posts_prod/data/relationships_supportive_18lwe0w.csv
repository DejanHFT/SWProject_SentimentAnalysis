Cancer home support struggles,icsk8grrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18lwe0w/cancer_home_support_struggles/,2,3,"Please be gentle as I’m mentally struggling already. Grammar may not be great, it is what it is. 

I (35f) am the Caregiver to my husband (40m)who is going through chemo for recently diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-cell). We have a 5 month old daughter as well. My family has been able to provide some support with baby mostly on weekends, his mom is moving up but isn’t super helpful or reliable. He lurks here, so honey if you read this, just know I love you and we’ll get through this. 

He was doing inpatient for 3 weeks to start, then was released home for a weekend before readmission for another 4 days for additional chemo. He’s allowed to be home (attending an outpatient transfusion center) for a couple of weeks prior to his next hospital stay. He hates the hospital, so being home is important to him. 

That being said, I’m having a hard time motivating him to consistently eat, bathe, hydrate, take his meds, or just let me help him in general. I assume he wants to do his normal routine to likely help take burden off my shoulders and feel more in control of his life. I continue to remind him that allowing me to help him and doing his best to focus on eating drinking and resting IS helping me more than getting himself overwhelmed and dehydrated/undernourished. 

I have offered him a variety of protein shakes, gotten him anything he’s craving or thinks he’d try, I got him a big water bottle with a straw, I put snacks by his bed, I make him meals and bring them to him in bed, bring him his meds. He never finishes his food, despite small portions, he barely touches the protein shakes, drinks only a few cups of water a day (water intake has always been an issue with him even pre-cancer), and sometimes doesn’t finish his meds (especially pills because he has a gag reflex issue). He does better at getting himself to do all of these things in the hospital, which is frustrating because I’m trying my best to be his support person while also caring for a baby and it is so much pressure. I feel like I’m failing but you can only bring a horse to water, as they say. 

He’s lucid, he’s able to walk around, we’ve been able to go on short outings, he’s able to watch TV and hold long conversations, attend webex work meetings, take calls, play a little with his daughter etc. Despite this he won’t focus on taking care of himself or letting me do it, and it’s like pulling teeth to get him to do the bare minimum despite him knowing if we can’t get him to do these things then he can’t stay home. We’re waiting on a call about setting up a home health nurse, but for now - what do I do? He knows he needs to do these things, he’s just checked out and it’s getting overwhelming for me because the burden of forcing him to listen to me is getting very heavy. We aren’t giving up, but I need advice. Thank you.

Tl;Dr: husband (40m) of 10 years has leukemia. I’m (35f) his main caregiver while he’s not in the hospital, but I can’t get him to consistently take care of himself or allow me to do so. We also have a baby (5monthsf), cue exhaustion and frustration."
