Where do you write and keep your workout plan as well as progress?,-i3arty-,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/dlyey6/where_do_you_write_and_keep_your_workout_plan_as/,125,60,"Hi all
I been wondering how you all keep your workout plan organized as well as progression.
I have Google docs, mainly because I can access on phone and pc, but with time it got messy, I have different workouts, a lot of exercises different ones, this one better this one for this better etc references, but it's all clumsy.
I wanted to use hide and expand exercises I don't use that much in Google docs but it doesn't work such feature there. So I been wondering where I could reorganize my workout plan so it looks neat by taking ideas of other people.

So where do you have your workout plan and progression, how to you manage it and why?

Thanks all"
