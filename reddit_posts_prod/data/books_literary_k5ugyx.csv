Literary Booktubers/ Instagrammers,erintdoyle1,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/k5ugyx/literary_booktubers_instagrammers/,28,18,"I’m looking for booktubers/ influencers that cover more literary and classic fiction. I’m not a big reader of genre fiction/ YA and they seem to be the only ones who have YouTube channels.

I’m subscribed to ‘Supposedly Fun’ who does the kind of content I’m talking about. Does anyone have any similar recs? Would be much appreciated!!!"
