Non-musician vs musician: sense of melody,Tasty_Comfortable_77,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/17f4xqw/nonmusician_vs_musician_sense_of_melody/,10,7,"I'm a non-musician. I've made a few attempts to ""learn"" music, but if the truth be told I just don't have the patience, and I have an alternative creative outlet. Nevertheless, I really enjoy music itself.

Probably my favourite melody (if that's the right word) is in Kraftwerk's ""Tour de France"". It sounds like a fairly simple line to me (I count about 12 notes in all), but being a non-musician, I wouldn't know. I also don't know *why* I like it, only that I *do* like it.

For people who *are* musicians, can you ""appreciate"" a melody without the need to know everything that's going on in it? My ""alternative creative outlet"" is photography, and when I see a photograph I like, I can usually figure out why, but if I can't, that doesn't make me like it less.

Or do you judge a melody on how much musical knowledge it demonstrates?"
