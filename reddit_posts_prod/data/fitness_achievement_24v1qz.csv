What can I achieve by going to the gym every day (or 5-6 days a week) for 3 months?,LookingForAHaircut2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/24v1qz/what_can_i_achieve_by_going_to_the_gym_every_day/,53,23,"With a lot of free time on my hands during the summer I decided to buy a 3 month subscription to my local, well-equipped gym for the June-August period. I want to make the most of it. How do I go about it? I want to get as much muscle as possible and get fitter in general. Whole body training. And diet + lots of sleep of course. I want to be in best shape possible by september."
