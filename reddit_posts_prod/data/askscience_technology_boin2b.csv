Could solar flares realistically disable all electronics on earth?,ejoch,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/boin2b/could_solar_flares_realistically_disable_all/,638,5714,"So I’ve read about solar flares and how they could be especially damaging to today’s world, since everyday services depend on the technology we use and it has the potential to disrupt all kinds of electronics.
How can a solar flare disrupt electronic appliances? Is it potentially dangerous to humans (eg. cancer)? And could one potentially wipe out all electronics on earth? And if so, what kind of damage would it cause (would all electronics need to be scrapped or would they be salvageable?)
Thanks in advance"
