What literary experience in your life do you hold most dear?,KoniginLW,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/v7n3da/what_literary_experience_in_your_life_do_you_hold/,66,63,"Doesn’t have to be a specific book you read or anything, maybe just a time in your life when books really helped you. I’ve just been thinking about this lately since I’ve finally had time to return to reading and I feel like a joyful, curious kid again. 

For me, it was 2nd to 5th grade. They were some of the worst years of my life. I went to a private catholic school during this time and being the only kid who didn’t believe in god got me targeted for bullying by both students and teachers. The only staff member who was kind to me was the librarian. We generally had a strict rule, only up to five books per week. I’m not sure if anyone remembers but back in the early-mid 2000’s, we had AR reading. Basically an online test you’d take for the book you checked out from the library. After a couple weeks of checking out the maximum books, passing the test perfectly for all five and doing it all over again the next week, the librarian took notice and started talking to me. I was mute at the time, terrified to talk for four years due to the bullying + undiagnosed autism. She started letting me take out ten books to try it out. Passed every test, read them voraciously. Eventually she allowed me to check out up to fifteen books a week. When I got home, during breaks and lunch, during my detentions (which I got a lot of for not having my math homework. Most detentions were done in the library, she allowed me to help shelve books which I loved) I read constantly. I read every instalment of Goosebumps in about a month. It was a k-12 school, and we technically weren’t allowed to check out books above our grade level, but by the time I was in my last year there before moving to public middle school I had read every book in the library, including the grade 12 books like the Lord of the Rings series and so on. She loved me, and she was the sweetest woman. When I was having my last day at school, she gifted me several books that were her favorites. Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, Solipsist by Henry Rollins, Lolita by Nabokov, Sabriel by Garth Nix, Phantom of the Opera by Leroux, and Les Miserables by Victor Hugo. She told me to save a few of them to read when I’m older of course, but I read them that summer. They’re all still some of my favorite books and so dear to my heart. I still have them, the Henry Rollins one is even signed and he soon became my favorite author. 

Though that time in my life was so rough, that little school library was my ray of light. I’ll forever be thankful to that woman for not only giving me that freedom to learn and grow doing something I loved, but also gave me the hope that not all religious folk are like the teachers and classmates I had. She gave me hope that I can meet kind and wonderful people anywhere. We still talk to this day, even though she’s retired and I’ve moved to Germany we often exchange phone calls and written letters."
