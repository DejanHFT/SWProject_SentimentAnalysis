I'm trying to work out what kind of designer/creative I am,Technical-Turnip,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/gqnvrq/im_trying_to_work_out_what_kind_of/,6,1," 

Hello. I sort of trying to work out what kind of designer I am and what sort of category I fall under.

I'm  a weird jack of all trades. i started off as an art student who was  interested in animation got offered a job working with Flash (the devils  tool) building elements and helping build websites and  animated/interactive elements. I was dubbed a web developer/jnr designer  (although my design skills sucked and I didn't do much designing there)  I also started designing websites for my own clients mainly in Flash  but then moving over into HTML/CSS static websites.

I  did some work with some other companies doing website layout designs  for them while continuing to do websites. I more and more got into doing  the whole project process by myself. Meet with clients, develop the  projects, sitemaps, wire-frames, site design, coding, seo, launch etc.  I've always liked doing each stage myself and not handing it off to  someone else even though I'm not an ace in anyone field.

i  then started doing a lot of web banner (flash/gif/static) for a while. I  did a lot of this and seem to do ok. I really liked bringing in  animation/motion design into these banners even though I was never  really an animator. I was also given a bit of graphic design work from  this company too but never considered myself a good graphic designer.

During  this time I got hired by a web company and loosely got dubbed web  designer/web developer although I would see it more like a jnr web  position. Most of the job was building web templates for WP/Joomla, some  web page design, updating older static sites, showing clients how to  update their sites and other mundane daily activities.

More  recently  I still do web design/development. I'm not a great coder and  most of my coding skills ins HTML/CSS and I mostly build static sites  and themes for WP. I don't do any full on backend coding or even much  JS. I'm not the best designer but can do a decent site design. I don't  do banner work anymore as that work has died out am now using Adobe  Animate to do instagram video ads/promos I can edit video (Premier) I  can use Photoshop and have spent time taking photos for businesses of  products and touching them up in PS.

So  I guess I'm trying to work out what kind of designer I am? I'm not a  graphic designer, a web dev, UI  and motion artist . Do I fall into that  Digtial Designer title? I'd love to hear some input from some people  who are smarter and more experienced than me where I fit in.

I'm  planning to start focusing more on my front end web coding skills and  web design skills (or UI) and put more time into learning motion design  with After Effects and Animate and maybe also start building my graphic  design skills.

Thanks!"
