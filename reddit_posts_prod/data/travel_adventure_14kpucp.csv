My question is HOW,halloweenhoe124,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/14kpucp/my_question_is_how/,486,474,"HOW do people have the time off work and the money to spend and the people to go with them on these adventures around the world?? I know girls my age (27) who have been to so many countries and have all these amazing adventures and I just don’t understand how. I work a full time job, don’t have friends to travel with, and don’t have the money to spend so I’m just wondering how you all do it?

Edit: I live in America if that changes anything. I appreciate all your responses!!!"
