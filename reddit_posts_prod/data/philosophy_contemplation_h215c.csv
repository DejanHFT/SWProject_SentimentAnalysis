Philosophy's place in the world at large,posthoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/h215c/philosophys_place_in_the_world_at_large/,9,3,"I wanted to make the title a bit longer and drop in something about how today's world has come to be defined by certain things (rapid technological advancement among other things), but wanted to keep it at that so I don't unnecessarily introduce any bias into the immediate thought process of anyone willing to respond.

That said, a little something about me so you can understand where this question is coming from. I am currently majoring in a course whose core discipline is using Mathematics to optimize processes, systems, etc., as aids in decision making/management. Needless to say, I love Math and the sciences. Even when I'm playing stuff like Red Alert or BroodWar, I'm obsessively trying to find the optimal build times, unit composition, formation, etc. When I'm playing baseballl, basketball, or football, it's the same (I'm also a sports nut) - recalling the highest percentage plays in a given situation, stuff like that.

But Philosophy in my mind is to be esteemed as much as the sciences; Ricoeur will argue as much, and to me, it gives life perspective (cue Socrates). The most elegant solutions to philosophical problems engage me intellectually just as much as an elegant solution to a chess problem, or an optimization problem would. Just like the sciences, the applications in real life are endless; it even suffers the same pitfalls - sometimes, discussion of either field can devolve into endless rabble, and sink into the depths of pedantry, which I despise.
I just find it striking that some of the people I know in real life, good friends of mine, think that Philosophy is complete bullshit. From people who supposedly possess the scientific pedigree necessary for success (i.e., which would include an open mind), this makes me sad; do most people really think philosophy is useless, that contemplation cannot change anything, that an idea cannot galvanize the intellectual giants of our time to try and better the human condition?

So post away; is philosophy still perceived by many to be important to society? Do many people think it is useless now? I don't care which side you take, all I ask is you provide a well-reasoned explanation. Doesn't have to rigorous, although I'm sure it would be appreciated :D"
