What is your reason/Motivation to get/stay in shape?,Patwhite293,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/15d8xe/what_is_your_reasonmotivation_to_getstay_in_shape/,45,8,"I am just curious, mine is out of habit. my friends used to go to the gym and would take me and i fell in love with it. It became routine and to be honest I feel like lifting makes me a much more easy going person than i would be without it. I look good in the summer, I feel good year round and my confidence couldn't be in a more stable place. I just found /r/fitness and am curious, What made you make the decision to get healthy?"
