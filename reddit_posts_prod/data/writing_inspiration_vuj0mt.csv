How do you retain inspiration,Jrapiro,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/vuj0mt/how_do_you_retain_inspiration/,4,3,"I don't really know if I'm using the word correctly here, but I feel like I occasionally get hit with bouts of ""inspiration"" that just make me so much better and more likely to actually get writing done. Like, right now, I'm listening to a song that just pumps me full of it, I hear it and think of a remorseful character, dying as all the memories, good and bad, flood their head and I \*want\* to write, but I can also feel myself already getting out of it.  I have a whole world ready, pages of notes and ideas, and I've made a good start, but I have so much left to do. I know a big part of it is just pushing through, but I work full time now and it's so much easier to just focus on the minute-to-minute. Any advice??"
