Native American Writers - Advice on using Indigenous-inspired characters respectfully,Weirdoi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18acglo/native_american_writers_advice_on_using/,6,2,"For context: I'm writing a high fantasy story, involving a kingdom on two continents. One continent is based on the Americas, the other Europe.

My main question here is, are there any tropes in fiction you notice white people do that are either clich√© or flat-out disrespectful? I do a lot of research into my writings, even in my own culture (Middle Eastern), and I don't like isolating people from those cultures. Certain steps I've already taken are: not using any real nation's names (obviously), not using the names of any real deities or beings (save for things like the thunderbird), using actual indigenous names rather than making up my own, and using actual language translators to figure how to conjugate English to other languages, so my place names don't sound stupid. 

Any other advice you can offer, or tropes you simply hate seeing? To be clear, these will simply be characters in the world. I'm not writing Dancing with Wolves or anything, this is just a fantasy world I created because I found parallels in the Romans calling the Britons ""noble savages"", and constructed a world around that.
