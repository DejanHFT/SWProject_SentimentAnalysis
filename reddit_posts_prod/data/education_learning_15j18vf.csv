Developing a New Tool for Active Learning Using Wikipedia,SquigglyLinesMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/15j18vf/developing_a_new_tool_for_active_learning_using/,0,3,"Hi everyone!

We're developing a tool that aims to turn Wikipedia pages into interactive knowledge maps to help you learn the underlying knowledge from each article. We're seeking feedback from learners that might find this useful.

If you're interested in having a brief chat with us about this, please visit our [website](https://www.enlinked.io/learn-fast-learn-anything) and consider joining our waitlist today!

Many thanks for your time!
