How do people achieve insanely fast progression?,nSunsGod,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7zu7bg/how_do_people_achieve_insanely_fast_progression/,71,30,"Hey, I'm wondering how some people just seem to gain strength so much faster. I'm going 6 days a week, eating enough protein, and being consistent, but some people just develop so fast. Is it in the program? I'm currently following the nSuns strength program so it shouldn't be a huge factor.

Here is an example of Tom Boyden who trains with Jujimufu, a youtuber and lifter - his deadlift went from 265 to 405, a crazy 140lb increase in 10 months. I have only increased my deadlift 80lbs since I began lifting in the end of June. What stops my progression from being as fast? Genuinely trying to learn and hopefully correct some mistakes or habits. Thanks for the advice."
