Question about cardiovascular wellness,Lost_Follower,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5ryb0r/question_about_cardiovascular_wellness/,4,1,"I have been out of the gym for about two years and i just started going back in. I'm going three days a week and doing starting strength and mixing in some cardio. I noticed that while my muscles are capable of lifting plenty my lungs and breathing can't keep up. I run out of breath quickly and even when i stop to catch my breath i feel like i just ran a marathon. 

How can i get my cardiovascular system in shape? "
