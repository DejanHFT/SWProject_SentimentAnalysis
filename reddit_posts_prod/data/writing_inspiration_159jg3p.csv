How much is too much when taking inspiration from another author?,Necrocreature,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/159jg3p/how_much_is_too_much_when_taking_inspiration_from/,3,1,"Hey there, I'm just beginning to start writing (Here's to hoping I can finish it!) and I'm noticing that some of my ideas are very blatantly stolen from other writers. I'm aware taking inspiration is fine, after all, so many authors take from Tolkien, or the story of King Arthur. Personally, the book series I'm currently reading (Joe Abercrombie's The First Law) is what inspired my story, but because of that I'm noticing that I want to take a lot of the features and tone from Joe Abercrombie's work.

So, how much is too much? The thing that set me personally into this train of thought is that my main character is very inspired by one of his minor characters (Maybe too much, I'm still unsure), and I was curious where this sub stands on taking inspiration from other authors."
