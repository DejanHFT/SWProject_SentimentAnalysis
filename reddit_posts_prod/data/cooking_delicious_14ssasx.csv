Does anyone else get that 15-bean soup bag from the store for some delicious hamnbeans?,baconbits2023,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/14ssasx/does_anyone_else_get_that_15bean_soup_bag_from/,23,49,"In America, in the dry bean aisle, they sell this bag of beans called 15 Bean Soup.

As you can imagine it has 15 different kinds of beans (and a seasoning pack)

We also did it this way:

Soak beans overnight.

Then dice onion, green bell pepper and celery.

Bulb of garlic. 

Cook veg then add garlic (as much as you want, I usually use all the cloves, just toss them in whole after getting the skin off, they break down)  and cook a bit more.

Then add - beans, water, and seasoning pack.

Also 2-4 hamhocks. Go for 4, if you buy 2 you will wish you got 4.

Also, add 2 cans of Rotel Tomatoes and a couple of bay leaves.

I also add some sliced pepperoncini and some of the juice.

After a couple of hours, the ham hocks will break apart and you can fish out the bones and fat. (that meat tho makes the dish)

Add salt if needed or use chicken stock and not water.

Can serve this with some nice bread and a side of pickled onions!"
