Is strong AI possible?,DOOF_N_PUSS,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/rgycj/is_strong_ai_possible/,3,5,"I know that strong AI is the goal of artificial intelligence research, but it seems like a very difficult goal to attain. If it is theoretically possible then how far away are we from creating strong AI? I was just wondering if it would someday be possible to have an AI be able to problem solve as proficiently as a human can. I also know that humans use a lot of heuristic problem solving methods which are faster than algorithmic methods, but are less reliable. It just seems to me that it would be hard to make a computer use heuristics. "
