Looking for a historical account of the 1990s in the United States,Ok_Tap3474,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/t7wmjg/looking_for_a_historical_account_of_the_1990s_in/,31,23,"  

Hallo everyone. That’s my first post on reddit so let me know if there is something I need to do differently. 

Recently I have gotten very interested in the time period from the end of the Cold War up to 9/11. From what I have read about it, this decade is often described as having been somewhat carefree and stable due to is placement in history between the two aforementioned historically significant events that changed the world in profound ways. Domestically the US economy was booming, foreign politics was out of tension after the fall of the Soviet Union and Pop Culture was flourishing with exciting new Movies and Music. I know that it wasn\`t really as carefree as often depicted, and a lot of it is probably due to nostalgia from the people how grew up during that time. And I am also aware that you can’t really fit history into convenient boxes like the 90s. Nevertheless, it’s a good way to think about history sometimes. 

Unfortunately, I haven’t really been able to find a good historical book on those topics. I am especially interested in the economic and political side of things, but I would also like to learn little bit more about the Culture in those times. Since Clinton was President almost throughout the whole decade, I also thought about reading a book on the Clinton years.

Any suggestions are appreciated"
