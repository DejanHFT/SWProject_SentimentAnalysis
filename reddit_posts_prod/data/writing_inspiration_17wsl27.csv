Inspiration/ Copying/plaigarism,RuleNaive9971,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/17wsl27/inspiration_copyingplaigarism/,7,0,"I am an aspiring writer, never published anything yet, I have many ideas in my mind, but I do see a pattern, that there are many short films (that are practically out there for audience to watch and enjoy) are behind my inspirations, the way they develop story, the way they do the character development, the back stories and also the elements that hold the whole story (For Eg- a monstrous creature), it fascinates and inspires me to add them in my stories as well.
I am now confused and anxious and fearful of not being authentic. Will this turn my stories stale and make them  cheap copies of the inspiration source, or it is very normal and acceptable to take up ideas from other sources as well.???"
