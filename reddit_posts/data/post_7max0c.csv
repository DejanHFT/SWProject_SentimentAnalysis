Why don't Chess AIs like AlphaZero always lead with the same opener?,themiro,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7max0c/why_dont_chess_ais_like_alphazero_always_lead/,8,13,"After watching a couple of videos of AlphaZero (Google's new AI) playing against Stockfish (the previous Chess AI champion), I noticed that AlphaZero played different opening moves each time. See [this game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1IbEzU28ec) versus [this game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEBMLlIPuM). Why does this occur? Wouldn't the AI prefer to always start with the same optimal move?"
