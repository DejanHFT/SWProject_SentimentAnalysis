"I'm Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer of Microsoft, author, woodworker, perpetual learner, and podcast host. Ask me anything about AI, software development, or what I think about the future of tech.",KevinScottMicrosoft,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/uz33f3/im_kevin_scott_chief_technology_officer_of/,190,318,"I’m Microsoft's Chief Technology Officer. I have a podcast called Behind the Tech where I interview some of today's most interesting thinkers in tech, creativity, science, and entrepreneurship. In 2020, I wrote a book titled Reprogramming the American Dream, which is in large part about my belief that AI technology should benefit everybody. In previous roles, I led engineering at LinkedIn, helped run a startup called AdMob, and worked as an engineer at Google in the early 2000s.

I'm here today to answer questions on the state of technology, particularly AI. I believe that when built and used responsibly, AI is an incredibly useful tool that can transform how we try to solve some of the world's most pressing challenges. I am passionate about building and democratizing ethical technology, empowering its users, and making the world a generally more creative and wonderful place. Ask me anything!
