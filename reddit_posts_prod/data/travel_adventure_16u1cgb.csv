Does anyone have experience with G Adventures tours?,balmondjuice,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16u1cgb/does_anyone_have_experience_with_g_adventures/,6,1,I am interested in the Patagonia 9 day hike they offer. I am 24 and very active and have done solo travel in the past in europe and asia. I am in dental school right now and I am restless but donâ€™t want to plan my own trip.
