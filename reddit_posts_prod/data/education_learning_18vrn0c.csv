"If the intention is really to absorb learning or news, stress on colors and visually appealing images not a noise?",DigitalSplendid,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/18vrn0c/if_the_intention_is_really_to_absorb_learning_or/,0,0,"Finding a corollary between GUI and CLI in computer and the trend of moving away from text books with fewer colors to audios/videos/short texts in learning. In the 1980s as a kid, our text books once passed KG would be text-based with fewer images. Even images were in black & white. If a book colorful, I would smell not intended for serious learners and kind of a lollypop. 

Today, there is perhaps too much emphasis on colorful images and videos. Is our core learning impacted? I fail to understand why a website that will be say focused on learning or even news stories needs to have a visually appealing website design. After all, if the intention is really to absorb learning or news, are other things not a noise?"
