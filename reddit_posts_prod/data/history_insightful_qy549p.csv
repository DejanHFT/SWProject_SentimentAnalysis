"Simple/Short/Silly History Questions Saturday, November 20, 2021",AutoModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/qy549p/simpleshortsilly_history_questions_saturday/,267,366,"Welcome to our Simple/Short/Silly history questions Saturday thread! 

This thread is for all those history related questions that are too simple, short or a bit too silly to warrant their own post. 

So do you have a question about history and have always been afraid to ask? Well, today is your lucky day. Ask away!

Of course all our [regular rules and guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index) still apply and to be just that bit extra clear: 

- Questions need to be historical in nature.
- Silly does **not** mean that your question should be a joke."
