What films have a successful Third Act?,boodabomb,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6jexlv/what_films_have_a_successful_third_act/,414,115," A common critique that I see in a *lot* of reviews or even comments here on /r/movies is that a film fell flat in the third act or  ""It was amazing, until the third act."" 


What are some examples of films that were wildly successful in their third act or are known for the strength of their third act?"
