The modern Existential crisis,i_inhale_repellents,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ppo77/the_modern_existential_crisis/,261,289,"As a white, American, upper-middle class college student who faced relatively no adversity growing up, my worst enemy is boredom. This has become the greatest source of psychological tension in modern life. We are a generation who constantly checks Reddit and Facebook and can watch TV with no commercials, and reproduction has moved from the top to the bottom of our list of goals as a species. I love learning, thinking, and imagining more than anything, and I enjoy attending class, but I don't have the patience to sit down every day and read a fucking book. Furthermore, our comfortable lifestyle is born from the suffering of others, who don't have the benefits of education and leisure time to contemplate the universe and the self. I have come to understand my identity as an aristocrat, but at same time, I feel like a joke.

I'm currently working on my thesis in the field of Criminal Psychology, which fascinates me more than anything, probably because I grew up in a neighborhood where crime was virtually nonexistent. I like it because it's exciting and unknown, which seems like a pretty vain reason to me.

Sure, I'm happy. I often experience moments of transcendence. I believe in morality and meaning and the importance of life. But I feel as if I'm on a road to nowhere because I don't have the ability to do anything without questioning, and my questions just go deeper and deeper until I have reached oblivion and lethargy, which is such a privileged problem to have. I am crippled not by my socioeconomic situation or physical limits, but by curiosity, which is unheard of to most of the world.

I've made an appointment with a shrink to help me sort out my thoughts (another privilege most people don't get), but I wanted to see if Reddit can help. Who else feels these things, and who has overcome this problem?


EDIT: Thanks for your suggestions. But I want to bring to light one of my inherent problems: I have a really short attention span, and I don't have the capacity to work on anything for very long. I read a lot, but I'm a slow reader and usually space out for long, LONG periods of time whenever I read anything mentally stimulating, going deep in thought about particular parts of the text, sometimes one sentence after the other. I guess this is more of a cognitive issue than an emotional one, so if anyone can help with that, I would appreciate.

EDIT: Thanks for all the AWESOME responses. Sincerely. I'm reminded why I became this way and feel
much less alone. I'm going to try as many of your suggestions as possible. Good luck to everyone else on their journey to self-actualization and thanks for the help!"
