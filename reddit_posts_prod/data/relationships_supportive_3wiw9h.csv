I [23F] feel like my husband [36M] is not supportive of our family. Not sure if I have unreasonable expectations. [Update],SadAndLonelyWife,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wiw9h/i_23f_feel_like_my_husband_36m_is_not_supportive/,72,701,"[Original](https://redd.it/3u0xq4)

So I realized after posting here, then talking to a counselor I was in such a bad relationship. I had gotten a good lawyer that my dad found for me, and he has graciously paid the retainer for the firm he strongly recommended and I chose. (I haven't asked for any money from my parents since I became an adult, so he was very willing to help me out.)

I had gotten an EPO against my husband and moved myself out of the apartment. My name is off the lease as of the day I moved, and the housing director of the campus neighborhood I lived in says that I am not liable for any damage that happens to the apartment since she saw it shortly before I moved out.

I really didn't want to get an EPO, but it seemed necessary. My husband also knows about EPOs, and threatened to kick me out of our apartment using one once. He and his mother also do not take good care of my daughter, but I previously thought if two adults said the same thing about her care, it might be okay. After talking to people such as my attorney and the domestic violence advocate about what decisions they made for her care, they said what they did was wrong. When I didn't agree with what my mother-in-law does with my child, my husband always made me feel crazy when I wanted to talk about it. Ugh. I'm really hoping to escalate it to a domestic violence order on our court date. (He also had several guns.)

I currently have temporary sole custody of my daughter as provisioned by the EPO. I am going to try my best to give my daughter the stability and care she needs. My husband and his mom would not let me get her vaccines (they cause autism?!?) and many other things.

I got my husband and his mom off of all of my cards. Had to change the account number on some of them, since there's no way for me to get them back and he could still use them if I didn't. (Didn't think to take them, d'oh!)

Right now, I'm living with my parents. I fortunately still have my job (and my boss is super supportive about the situation). I'm picking up the pieces, going to try to pay off the relatively massive debt my husband has put me in. I've gotten my academics in line; I got a post midterm withdrawal granted based on my situation, so I won't be suspended from the college I'm pursuing my degree in.

Bracing myself for any retaliation. I think my case is excellent, and I have a great lawyer on my side.

Thanks, reddit. You've been a great help.

tl;dr: Got out of a bad place and covered my behind financially and academically. Getting my daughter the care she needs. Shit status: together."
