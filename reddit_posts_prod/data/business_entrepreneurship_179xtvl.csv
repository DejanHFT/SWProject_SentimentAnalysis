Currently, I'm thinking about pursuing computer science at a non-prestigious university. I'm curious, where can I gain knowledge about entrepreneurship? Is diving in and starting a business the best way to learn, or are there other effective approaches? I've heard mixed opinions about whether studying for an MBA is beneficial for starting a business. What's your take on this?"
