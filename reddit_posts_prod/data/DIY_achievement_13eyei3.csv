What is the appropriate tool for putting a 90 degree flange on brass pipe/tubing?,LATechSpartan,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/13eyei3/what_is_the_appropriate_tool_for_putting_a_90/,6,6,"What is the appropriate tool for putting a 90 degree flange on brass tubing? I’m only finding 45 degree flaring tools in my searches.

I’m working on a project where I’m utilizing some brass and copper pipe and I want to put a 90 degree flare on some of them. 

The fastest description of the project is that I’m basically making a small arduino controlled organ. The idea is to use a 90 degree flange to attach and secure custom made mutes to the end of each pipe/tube if desired.

A friend of mine asked me if I could build them a one off instrument of sorts and I’m trying to put together a cost estimate for them at the moment. I have the majority of tools that I’ll need. But I don’t have anything for creating this flange.

I’d like to be able to put together a mock-up of a couple of tubes to help determine how to achieve the desired sound.

I’m sure there is a hand tool set out there that will allow me to achieve this. But for some reason I’m not finding one while searching via google.

I’d appreciate any help!
Thanks!"
