Are Humans Really as Violent as History Suggests?,LoveaBook,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/eh0jt5/are_humans_really_as_violent_as_history_suggests/,303,921,"Human history is full of horrific, violent actions. But is this because we record the worst things we’ve done in the hopes of learning from them and avoiding them in the future, or because our species is so genuinely violent?

I mean, it seems to me that good things happen all the time, even in the worst places. And I’m not trying to discount our violent natures, I’m simply wondering if our history tends to show the worst of us? And if so, is there danger of such a one-sided discussion of human history reinforcing an idea that human violence can’t be avoided?
