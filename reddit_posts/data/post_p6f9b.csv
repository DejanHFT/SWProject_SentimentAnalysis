"Reddit, help a reporter: Have you applied for jobs that ask for your log-in information for Facebook? ",manuelv19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/p6f9b/reddit_help_a_reporter_have_you_applied_for_jobs/,1625,1348,"My dear Redditors,

I'm a reporter for The Associated Press.

I've seen several posts here of people taking pictures of job applications that ask for log-in information for Facebook, MySpace or other social networking sites.

Are you one of them? If so, you should email me at mvaldes@ap.org (or post here).

I'm hoping to write a story about this, even if it's isolated.

For you to be in the story, I will need your first and last name, as well as the name of the company that asked for the personal information.

Bonus points if you refused to give your passwords and you didn't get the job.

Again, reach me at mvaldes@ap.org

I've reached out to a few of you, and gotten some responses, including a redditor who was asked this information by a restaurant.

Many thanks, M

EDIT: Thank you all for the feedback (except for that one troll). I can't believe it made the front page on Wednesday. Once I have everything I need for an article, I'll surely post it on Reddit."
