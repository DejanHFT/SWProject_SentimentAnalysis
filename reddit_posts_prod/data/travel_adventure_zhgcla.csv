"Cold, snowy mix of romance and adventure in April 1st?",Those_Lingerers,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zhgcla/cold_snowy_mix_of_romance_and_adventure_in_april/,3,0,"Please help me find the place I imagine in my mind for our anniversary! We are flying from Dallas and want to stay in the States. I'm looking for a cold location, preferably with snow still on the ground (not necessary because it's early spring). Romantic, like a bed and breakfast, but with activities nearby, like snowmobiles, hiking, even fishing would be great. Ideally, a hot tub or hot spring to soak in! Also, I prefer more upscale lodging and level of service. We don't ski so I don't really want to stay at a ski resort. Budget is $5000 for 3-4 nights. 


We are going for a mix of luxury romantic and adventure."
