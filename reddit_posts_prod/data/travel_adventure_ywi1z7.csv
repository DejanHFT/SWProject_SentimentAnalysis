Has anyone here done any guided adventure vacations?,promiscuous_cactus,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ywi1z7/has_anyone_here_done_any_guided_adventure/,3,1,"I would love to do an ""adventure vacation"" that includes things like kayaking, mountain biking, hiking/trekking, or something of that sort. I feel like that's the kind of thing that would be best for me to do on an organized/guided trip because I'll be traveling alone and want to go somewhere that's very out of my element like Patagonia or Southeast Asia. Has anyone done a vacation like that and what did you like or not like about it? Also, does anyone have any specific travel companies they can recommend for this type of thing?"
