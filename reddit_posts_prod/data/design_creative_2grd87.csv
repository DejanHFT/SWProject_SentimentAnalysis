Getting Adobe's Creative Cloud day 5,SirDidymus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/2grd87/getting_adobes_creative_cloud_day_5/,28,21,"This week I intended to buy Adobe's Creative Cloud solution because, let's face it, when a client gives you files created in CC, you can only weep in silence or get the CC version. So I decided to go for it, buy Creative Cloud for my business and pay for their annual membership fee. It took me eight attempts to get past their payment system (apparently, the problem I was facing is ""under investigaiaon"", so no worries there), after which the console told me the ""order was processing"".

I got no email or invoice whatsoever, and was eagerly awaiting the order to come through. (I've been using Steam over the past years, so I figured online software retail ought not to be difficult). Skip ahead 3 days, order is still ""processing"". Contacted their support, and the employee told me my credit card would not accept their charge. It's a perfectly valid credit card, it only bounced because they attempted to set me up with an annual fee. 

He then told me I ought to allow my bank to allow for payments to Adobe, but could not give me an amount, a due date or an invoice. I then said I had to verify some things first (being somewhat reluctant to allow a company to charge my credit card for any amount they're not willing to disclose) and asked him to cancel my order. He assured me he would, and 24 hours later I'm still getting the ""order being processed"" message. 

This is really worrying me. Adobe is a company that has bought out most valuable competitors, and I'm really relying on their products for most of my job. How do the rest of you go about this? 

(Sorry for the wall of text. TLDR; I'm not sure I trust Adobe software anymore after every single aspect of their suite stopped functioning.)
