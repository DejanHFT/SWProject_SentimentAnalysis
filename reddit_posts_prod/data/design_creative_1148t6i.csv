Are there creative roles where Psychology and Design intercept?,Ger_berd_10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/1148t6i/are_there_creative_roles_where_psychology_and/,23,23,"I have just completed my Bachelor of Psychological Science, however, most jobs that I’m encouraged to apply for don’t excite me as a career path. When I talk to careers counsellors I’m directed to jobs like school counsellor, HR, ABA therapist etc which I unfortunately don’t have the interest in applying for. I was extremely invested and excited about my electives which were Design (object) and Graphic Design subjects where I did quite well. Can anyone suggest roles, jobs or organisations where creative design and psychology intercept?

Edit: A massive thank you to everyone for incredible insights!! I’m now off on a research quest."
