Looking for an adventure in Africa, something wild- crossing the Sahara, climbing mountains, exploring the jungles etc. 

Don't have much money and seems like the most expensive thing about Africa is getting there. 

I'm in Morocco right now but flights seem to be cheaper from the colonial rulers to the African country (Ex- France to anywhere in western Africa). 

US citizen btw so can't enter a lot of African countries without a visa

Thanks for the ideas"
