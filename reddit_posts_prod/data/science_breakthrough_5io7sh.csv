"Science AMA Series: Hi, we're editors and writers at Science Magazine, currently working on the Breakthrough of the Year issue. Ask us anything!",AAAS_Breakthrough,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5io7sh/science_ama_series_hi_were_editors_and_writers_at/,236,2215,"Hi reddit!
 
2016 was an amazing year for science, and much of the breakthrough research appeared in the pages (both physical and digital) of Science Magazine.  Now, we're working on a special end-of-year issue that will bestow upon one scientific achievement the title of ""Breakthrough of the Year.""
 
Every December, Science magazine announces a Breakthrough of the Year and a short list of runners-up. We, the writers and editors, comb through the year’s scientific advances--with help from the Board of Reviewing Editors and other scientists--and judge which have done the most to benefit humanity, answer long-standing questions, or pave the way for fruitful new research.
 
It’s a tricky task. Many discoveries take years to catch fire; others seem exciting but never fulfill their promise. And even when something big happens in science, it’s not always obvious exactly when and where the “breakthrough” took place. Here is our list of ""greatest hits.""
 
All that said, we also have [People's Choice award](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/vote-your-scientific-breakthrough-year), and this year, we wanted to come to Reddit to talk about the year in science and what you think might deserve the Breakthrough of the Year award.
