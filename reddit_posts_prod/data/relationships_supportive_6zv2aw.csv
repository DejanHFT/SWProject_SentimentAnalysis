I (20F) want to marry my boyfriend (24M) and not tell my family. Boyfriend is supportive of this idea,newnhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6zv2aw/i_20f_want_to_marry_my_boyfriend_24m_and_not_tell/,35,0,"I grew up in a large city. There's always things to do, new foods to eat, and beautiful sightseeings. But my parents hate living in a city, and they think it's not worth the money. So they packed up and moved us to a tiny town. We've lived here for about 7 years now. 

I've been unhappy ever since we have moved. I've tried accepting the place, but I'm bored out of my mind every single day. There's literally nothing to do. No good restaurants, no taxi, no bus, no fun place. You have to drive if you want to find something small to do. 

1 year ago, my boyfriend moved here to be close with me. But he also doesn't like it. I know this sounds stupid, but it feels like we are fish out of water. Maybe no one can understand, but it's not fun. If you love the city, it's hard to live in the country. 

This situation has been adding to my depression. I told my boyfriend, ""I just want to do something crazy and move away to somewhere busy."" The thing is, I feel like I'm trapped here. I know I'm more than old enough to move out, but my mom always guilt trips me about it. 

I've always been extremely close to my parents. They have been my best friends since day 1. But any time I try to do something on my own my mom gets upset. My dad is supportive, but he's still sad. When my brother moved out, my mom cried for weeks and told me ""don't even think about leaving me"". Eventually I told her that one day I'm going to have to move, and she got literally mad and sad ""wow I'm so glad everyone is deciding to leave me, I cannot believe you."" And she just makes me feel guilty to the point where I push it off. 

At this point, I'm sick of it. So my BF said, ""Marry me and I will start another life with you, wherever you want."" At first I didn't want to, because I'm so young. But my boyfriend has done *huge* sacrifices for me, so now I don't care. 

But I don't want to tell my parents, because they don't ever agree with the things I want to do. I just feel really bad about keeping them in the dark. I'm conflicted. I asked my boyfriend what he thinks, and he's really upset that I ""have to even consider this"" but he said he will support me in whichever decision I make. 

I really want to do this, and I am scared about my parents. But one day I'm going to have to grow up and do things on my own (or with my husband)

TL;DR **My parents like living in the country, but my boyfriend and I prefer a bigger city. I've been extremely unhappy and depressed so my boyfriend wants to marry me and move. I want to do this because I love him and he has made huge sacrifices for me, on his own ideas. But I'm afraid of telling my parents because they will be upset and disagree. I think since I'm the youngest, my entire family tries to control my decisions**"
