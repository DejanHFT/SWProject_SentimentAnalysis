Can I find inspiration for my characters from some from movies?,Kichiwas-Hargan,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/wimtwm/can_i_find_inspiration_for_my_characters_from/,5,1,"I thought up some ideas to make my characters for my future projects after I drew inspiration from some characters that are kinda mediocre in my opinion from some movies I saw. I'm saying this because I don't want to feel like I'm ripping those characters off, I was just interested in how they are and what they do, which gave me some ideas for the characters I want to create in my novels.

Also, I don't know if coming up with a character that's inspired by nothing would be okay since I looked up characters from some well-known novels are inspired. I thought that they wouldn't work the way I thought they would. I don't know, is it okay to find inspiration from some characters from movies I've seen before? Cuz it's easier to do that than to do it with anything from my life to be honest."
