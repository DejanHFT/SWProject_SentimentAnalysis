"Tactical and Strategy games that play ""fair""",InflamedLiver,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/x17zoe/tactical_and_strategy_games_that_play_fair/,12,1,"Most of the time when I'm playing any strategy game, the board is stacked against you.  Either a limitation of turns so you can't move your team in the most efficient and safe manner, or just the typical Player Team of 4-6 character VS 20+ enemies that are thrown at you 4-6 at a time.  Or games like Fire Emblem where there's permadeath, so even if you kill all 20 bad guys, losing a key top character in one skirmish pretty much guarantees you lost the war.  

Is there a game where it's a matter of actual skill VS skill to at least a marginal extent?  Most everything from X-Com to whatever these days feels like you're trying to play chess, except the enemies have 2-3 times your pieces, and if you lose even a single rook or bishop you pretty much failed even if you win the match."
