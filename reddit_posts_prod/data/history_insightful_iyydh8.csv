Why didn’t Spain hold onto the Two Sicilies,dondon98,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/iyydh8/why_didnt_spain_hold_onto_the_two_sicilies/,42,1351,"I’m trying to find the reasoning why as
If I remember correctly the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was ruled by a member of the cadet branch of the Spanish bourbons. Why was it not ruled by the King of Spain proper? 

I originally thought that this was due to the Napoleonic Wars but Spain and the Two Sicilies were ruled by different members of the House of Bourbon before this.

Wikipedia says that it was due to a treaty that the countries could not be ruled by the same sovereign but I cannot find any treaty that says so? Can anyone explain or give me some insight."
