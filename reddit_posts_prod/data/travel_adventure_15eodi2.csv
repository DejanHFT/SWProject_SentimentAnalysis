G Adventures trip: Is it worth it?,stelman2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15eodi2/g_adventures_trip_is_it_worth_it/,42,47,"Hey everyone,

I just discovered G adventures and they have some trips on last minute deals which seem really good deals. However I have no idea the price of these trips usually or if they are worth the money...

My question is: Is it worth it?  
I was looking to do the  ""Botswana and Falls Overland: Wildlife Walks & Safari Drives in Botswana, Africa - G Adventures "". 

Has anyone done it? Do you reccomend it or reccomend G adventures in general?

I am a 24y male looking to do a memorable trip in a medium budget(\~1500 eur) travelling from the Netherlands fro around 2 weeks. If you reccomend smth please tell me!"
