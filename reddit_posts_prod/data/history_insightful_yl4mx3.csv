How did slavery work in imperial China?,War_Hymn,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/yl4mx3/how_did_slavery_work_in_imperial_china/,16,20,"I was under the assumption that chattel slavery (to differentiate it from indentured servitude) wasn't common in China during the Ming or Qing, but after taking a read of the translated Qing Penal Code, I find a lot of laws that referenced ""slaves"" and their rights under the law. For example, such slaves as denoted were not allowed to marry under threat of punishment by Qing law. Slaves were also not allowed to leave the households of their masters without permission as well.

All this hints that Qing society (and I assume other dynasties as well) had some form of chattel slavery system going on. Was it on the same scope as slavery in colonial Americas? Where did slaves come from? How can slave free themselves? Any insight or literature will be appreciated."
