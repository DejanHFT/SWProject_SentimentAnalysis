Does anyone else notice their mood drop considerably when they have not been eating well or exercising?,Captain-Friendzone,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1usljz/does_anyone_else_notice_their_mood_drop/,685,2792,"I have been eating badly since christmas and have not been to the gym in a few weeks (I do walks at night, pushups/pull-ups and recently got a spin bike so I have not been completely inactive) but I have noticed a shift in my mood and wondered if this was normal or if it was related to the lack of fitness in my life?

Any thoughts or explanations would be nice :) "
