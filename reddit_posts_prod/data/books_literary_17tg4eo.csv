How (if at all) do you think literary education in middle/high school should be done?,ksarlathotep,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17tg4eo/how_if_at_all_do_you_think_literary_education_in/,47,10,"I've seen more than a few comments on other posts talking about how forcing middle schoolers and high schoolers to read dry and inaccessible literature (even if it's important) spoiled their love for reading, or put some people off of reading for good.

Now I'm not a US native so my impressions regarding the US ""required reading"" education is second-hand, but I've had this talk with an American friend multiple times. He absolutely detested having to read The Scarlet Letter and As I Lay Dying and The Catcher In The Rye and said it basically ruined literature for him for 10 years.

I totally get that. And it's similar in Germany where I went to school - you read some *really* old texts for their historic importance and to learn about the evolution of literature, and then some more contemporary ones which can be... dry. Not what you want to be reading at 14 or 15 or 16. But at the same time I think there is value in exposing teenagers to literature that they otherwise might never pick up, especially older literature and classics. Maybe nine out of ten kids will hate it, but it might be an eye-opening experience for one in ten. And I mean, some of the point of school is just to expose you to things so you can learn what interests you and what doesn't.

So I'm torn on this. Personally I liked most of the stuff I had to read in middle school and high school, but then I was a voracious reader and very interested in (art) history and philosophy and all kinds of nerdy things. I was wondering what this (book-positive, literature focused) subreddit thinks? Should all literature education be opt-in, or is there value in making everybody give it at least a fair shot? Should education in literature be done differently? Are there any books that you had to read that you think are particularly bad or good choices? "
