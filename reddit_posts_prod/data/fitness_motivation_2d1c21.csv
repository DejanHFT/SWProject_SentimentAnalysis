What was your motivation to get fit?,thepearld,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2d1c21/what_was_your_motivation_to_get_fit/,27,2,"What was the ""thing"" that made you make the change? That you thought about whenever you didn't want to go to the gym or run that extra mile? I ask because....well, I'm having difficulty finding my own. As a mother of only one little girl and the wife of a husband who works his ass off, I have yet to find that ""thing."""
