Door hinges that hold a door open at 10-15 degrees?,Gutchies,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/18hme0u/door_hinges_that_hold_a_door_open_at_1015_degrees/,5,0,"I need to leave a door open for my cat but I also need to control both privacy and sound in my bedroom/office at will. A big hole in my door for a pet door isn't really conducive to that. I also don't have permission to destructively modify the doors (renting) nor the money and space to replace the door for the duration of my tenancy.

My current solution is just a 5 lb dumbbell that I catch the door within the handle of, and even if I think it's clever to have it catch the door, it's not really an good solution. A wedge or weight is also an inelegant solution for my bedroom/office when I can be in and out several times an hour.

What I'm wondering is if there exists a door hinge that can hold my open door at that 10-15 degree angle without requiring a door wedge. Something that would passively spring towards that angle. The door still needs to be able to close, of course.

I found friction door hinges and automatically closing door hinges on the Home Depot website but these both wouldn't achieve what I want (even if a closing hinge leaves the door cracked, that's not enough - my cat wouldn't be able to escape my room)

I do little projects but I'm not familiar with DIY on this scale - I could make a spring loaded solution to this probably but I'm mostly wondering if a product could make it easier for me."
