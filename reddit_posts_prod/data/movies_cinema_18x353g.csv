"Movies where they went off the deep end, but still thought they were making great cinema?",thebigeverybody,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18x353g/movies_where_they_went_off_the_deep_end_but_still/,465,733,"I was just thinking about a Jaws rip-off called Orca: The Killer Whale. It's stuck in my mind all these years because it's the perfect blend of executives trying to cash in on a trend while filling it with as many exciting things as possible, not giving a damn if the story makes any sense or not.

The plot is about an angry killer whale that attacks a small town and blows up buildings trying to get revenge on a fisherman who killed the whale's wife and son. It's not a comedy, camp or anything remotely self-aware.

What are some movies you've seen where they take themselves perfectly seriously even though what they're putting on screen is totally barking mad?"
