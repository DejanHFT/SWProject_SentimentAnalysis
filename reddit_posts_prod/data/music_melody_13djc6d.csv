HELP ON WHAT THIS MELODY OR PEICE OF MUSIC IS CALLED,Gloomy-Credit-3551,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/13djc6d/help_on_what_this_melody_or_peice_of_music_is/,1,0," Can someone help me, what is the subtle effect at [0:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D8b74x6pg4&t=21s) called? It sounds absolutely amazing and I have heard similar effect in the anime class room of the elite season 2. But since I did not know what it is called I have been having a hard time finding more examples of this.   


Here is the link to the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D8b74x6pg4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D8b74x6pg4)  


It is 'Random Jam #46 \[tranquil hip-hop w/ ERAE Touch, Digitakt & Microcosm\]' by Aldo  


Thanks in advance"
