Written Reviews:

[The AV Club - A.A. Dowd](https://www.avclub.com/turns-out-that-a-boring-tomb-raider-movie-might-be-wors-1823772814)

> *...this Tomb Raider is a competently staged origin-story reboot, grounding the character’s globe-trotting, puzzle-solving adventures in something like a physical and even emotional reality. What’s missing, quite critically, is the sense that anyone involved saw more than a renewable franchise and milkable intellectual property in the exploits of an X-treme spelunker. When it comes to what should be the reliably dumb fun of tomb raiding, maybe there are worse crimes than insulting viewers’ intelligence or bombarding them with crappy special effects. Boring them? Now that’s a felony offense.* **C**

[The Chicago Tribune - Michael Phillips](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-tomb-raider-review-0314-story.html)

> *The Lara Croft reboot “Tomb Raider” isn’t half bad for an hour. Then there’s another hour. That hour is quite bad. It’s no fun watching your action heroine get shoved, punched and kicked to the sidelines of her own movie, while the menfolk take over and take turns overacting before expiring.* **2/5**

[Empire - John Nugent](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/tomb-raider/review/)

> *And in its desperation to maintain a relentless pace, even mundane events such as a bicycle race are recalibrated into pulsating action sequences. It’s 90 per cent dramatic peril, and competently shot, but it leaves the dialogue scenes feeling suspiciously similar to video game cutscenes.* **2/5**

[Entertainment Weekly - Leah Greenblatt](http://ew.com/movies/2018/03/14/tomb-raider-review/)

>*The latest big-screen iteration of the blockbuster video game isn’t a film for the ages, but it’s actually pretty good fun; an old-fashioned treasure-island adventure tale gilded in circa-2018 wokeness (Lara Croft’s breasts no longer command a lead supporting role) and anchored by an Oscar-winning actress far more gifted than the story requires.* **B**

[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/14/tomb-raider-review-alicia-vikander-dominic-west-lara-croft)

> *And throughout Vikander maintains a kind of serene evenness of manner. Blandness is Lara’s theme.*

[The Hollywood Reporter - Todd McCarthy](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/tomb-raider-review-1094069)

> *It's a new package for old goods in Tomb Raider, a grimly determined by-the-numbers rehash of the same sort of plots and action moves that animated the first two Lara Croft films back in the early 2000s. Brandishing impressively packed abs and enough upper body strength to pull herself out of countless jams, Alicia Vikander gamely steps into the kick-ass role twice played by Angelina Jolie, but the derivative story and cardboard supporting characters are straight out of 1930s movie serials.*

[IndieWire - Kate Erbland](http://www.indiewire.com/2018/03/tomb-raider-review-alicia-vikander-video-game-adaptation-reboot-1201938846/)

>*When “Tomb Raider” digs into its more creative action, including a breathless bike race through London and a genuinely queasy shipwreck, it’s about as entertaining as popcorn entertainment gets these days. It’s when the film falls back on the old tropes that things grind to a halt.* **C+**

[The Los Angeles Times - Justin Chang](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-tomb-raider-review-20180314-story.html)

> *It's hardly the first or last time Hollywood has plundered one of its own long-dormant properties, but it's also a reminder that not every resurrection has to feel like a desecration.*



[ScreenCrush - Matt Singer](http://screencrush.com/tomb-raider-review-2018/)

> *To her credit, Vikander works hard and looks the part. She also has some chemistry with Daniel Wu, who plays the guy who helps Lara get to the island and then sort of becomes her sidekick. (Then he says “I’m not leaving Lara behind!” and vanishes completely from the movie for about 30 minutes. Oh well.) By the standards of video game movies, Tomb Raider is not terrible, but by the standards of video game movies Plan 9 From Outer Space is practically an Oscar winner.*

[Slate - Inkoo Kang](https://slate.com/culture/2018/03/the-new-tomb-raider-movie-starring-alicia-vikander-reviewed.html)

>*An obligatory setup for a sequel slows down the final moments, but until then, Tomb Raider feels like a perfectly paced trio of espresso shots, with a shot of adrenaline to the heart as a chaser.*  

[USA Today - Brian Truitt](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/03/14/review-dull-tomb-raider-doesnt-do-its-wonder-woman-alicia-vikander-any-favors/423058002/)

> *But there are some fun moments that are welcome when they come, and Vikander boasts amazing abs and insane traps for a highly physical role that diversifies her résumé compared with the more thespian-ready stuff (Ex Machina, The Danish Girl). That said, her leaping in superhuman fashion over a crumbling crevasse tests the limits of belief suspension.* **1.5/4**

[Variety - Owen Gleiberman](http://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/tomb-raider-review-alicia-vikander-1202722123/)

>*The exciting surprise of the new “Tomb Raider,” directed by the Norwegian genre specialist Roar Uthaug, is that it doesn’t tamp down Vikander’s inner flame, or the three-dimensionality of her talent; it doesn’t fold and insert her into an overly gymnastic and CGI-happy thrill ride. The movie is full of vine-swinging, bow-and-arrow-shooting, ancient-spirit-meeting action, but most of it is staged on a convincing human scale, one that’s been expertly tailored to its star’s understated directness.*

[The Verge - Scott Tobias](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17119790/tomb-raider-movie-review-2018-alicia-vikander)

> *The 2018 Tomb Raider does well enough to satisfy a video game and movie franchise simultaneously, but the two aren’t easily reconciled. When Lara is pinned to a stone wall, trying to figure out which colored gem goes into which slot, it can’t help but feel like some offscreen controller is managing her actions. She isn’t a movie character anymore, she’s an avatar. As a machine-tooled diversion, however, this Tomb Raider improves considerably on the previous films, if only by dialing down the tacky excesses.*

[The Wrap - Alonso Duralde](https://www.thewrap.com/tomb-raider-film-review-alicia-vikander-2018/)

> *Since the genre of video games-turned-into-feature films has inflicted some real doozies on audiences, “Tomb Raider” towers above most of its peers by being merely OK. By any other measure, this is a saga of fits and starts, and we can only hope for smoother sailing if the film inspires the sequels it clearly hopes to engender.*"
