What can I (30M) do to be supportive of my partner (28F) while she's pregnant?,prideofneptune,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/j6jjas/what_can_i_30m_do_to_be_supportive_of_my_partner/,75,141,"Kind of an obvious/ stupid question, I know. My fiancé and I are expecting our first child, she's about 7 weeks now and isn’t shy about the fact that she’s horrified about becoming a mom. I try to calm her fears as best as I can, but I'm just as lost (if not more) than she is right now. 

I'd really like to be involved in the ""miracle of life"" process that she's going through right now in any way that I can. The concept of impending fatherhood in the near future still seems so abstract to me, so I hope that being more involved will give me more of a connection to our unborn child and give my wife-to-be peace of mind.

Anything I can do to help her be as happy and comfortable as possible during these next few months and beyond would be helpful to know. Small gestures, changes I could make to my daily routine, or thoughtful gift ideas? I can't go in with her to doctors appointments, which sucks... but there's not much I can do about that.

TL;DR: I’m looking for ways to make my fiancé feel appreciated and special while she’s pregnant, and after our child is born because we’re both feeling pretty confused right now."
