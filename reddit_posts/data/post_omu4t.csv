"Reddit mods, can we see some traffic stats after the blackout ended?",lancepants42,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/omu4t/reddit_mods_can_we_see_some_traffic_stats_after/,285,1389,"Maybe it's just my friends and me, but we thought it would be interesting to see the details on the onslaught of traffic after the site opened back up after the blackout. Any kind of data welcome.

**Edit:** Thanks for the feedback so far! I'm really surprised, actually. It seemed like most of the frontpage posts on major subreddits had an absurd number of votes immediately after the blackout ended, but the stats don't seem to show exceptionally high traffic; some are on par with any busy weekend day, yet some show a decline. I have no idea what it means, but I think it's interesting. Keep it coming!

**Edit 2:** I messaged the Reddit Gods asking for overall site traffic data. I'll be sure to post results if they deliver. I'm excited to see it, personally. Also, I'll add links to the graphs you have provided in the main post (in no particular order, for now, but I may rank them roughly by size if I get ambitious.)

**Another Edit:** Since I'm now on a data frenzy, I'm contacting other popular time-killing sites, asking for their traffic stats, to see if there is any statistically significant increase during the Blackout (bear in mind we weren't the only site to go down, so there actually may be something) [](and collecting data on trending topics on Facebook, Twitter, and Google Trends relevant to the blackout. Once I have more, I'll post it all, if there's demand. Credit for the idea to look at other sites goes to [mtfw, in this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/omu4t/reddit_mods_can_we_see_some_traffic_stats_after/c3ihyds)

**Update:** ~~I've yet to hear from anyone outside of Reddit about providing stats from around the web, but in retrospect it's only been a few business hours.~~  The gentlemen at Explosm.com replied to my email. They didn't put any analytics code in their blackout page, so there isn't any data during that period, but I asked if they had anything that shows before and after the blackout.

**Let's go somewhere with this.** I really like where this went, and I want to run with it. I made [another post on r/SOPA](http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/oo7ki/statistically_how_effective_were_the_blackouts/) explaining what I want to discern from all of this. If I get a fraction of the support this post got, we could do something big.

**FURTHERMORE** unless I hear complaints, I plan on rehosting all of these pics onto my imgur account. No I'm not going to take credit for them, no I'm not going to steal your identity. It's just so I can have them all in one place. If that's not ok, let me know. Otherwise, [here's the album](http://imgur.com/a/pMHe4) for those who like all their pics in one window.
