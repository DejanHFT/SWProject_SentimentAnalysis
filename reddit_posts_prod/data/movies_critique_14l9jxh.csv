The Wickerman (1973),Apprehensive-Cup2728,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/14l9jxh/the_wickerman_1973/,55,70,"Last night I watched a restored version of The Wicker Man. I’ve never seen it before. in 2020 I watched Midsommar and it became my favourite film ever. But WOW !! The Wicker Man absolutely blew it out of the water. I want to watch it again and then midsommar as it very much felt like a predecessor to it. Not a single second of that film is wasted. It is to me what The Exorcist is to many, it’s the best horror film, and maybe best film I’ve ever seen. The only critique I have is that I wish it dealt with male nudity the same way it did female. What are your thoughts on the film, do you have any critiques?

edit: every single response has been wonderfully interesting, thank you so much !!"
