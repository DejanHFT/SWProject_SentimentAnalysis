Who is your least favorite literary character?,teaontherocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18xw79x/who_is_your_least_favorite_literary_character/,495,206,"If you had to think back to all the books you've read over time, who was your least favorite character? It doesn't have to be an evil character, just someone you dislike. People sometimes like evil characters. For example, I wouldn't be surprised if some people liked Professor Moriarty, the criminal mastermind and Sherlock's enemy. So, the least favorite could be just a boring, annoying, complaining, or ineffective character. A friend dislikes Hamlet, for instance, for those kinds of reason.

Or someone selfish, animalistic, brutish, who lacks self awareness, which brings me to one of my least favorite characters, Stanley Kowalski from A Streetcar Named Desire. A brute of a man, he is sort of what I really dislike in people in general. He is a selfish, abusive, and an all around rough character. It helps that in the movie the character is portrayed by Marlon Brando and I get some people are drawn to him for that reason, to a handsome, masculine type of guy with raw animal energy, but otherwise, what an unlikable character! At least in my humble opinion..."
