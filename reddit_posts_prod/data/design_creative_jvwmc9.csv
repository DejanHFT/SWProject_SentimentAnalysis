Collaborate in young artists' creative project!,bbeeaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/jvwmc9/collaborate_in_young_artists_creative_project/,0,1,"Hello! Im a New York-based art school student currently working on a  **creative video** based on a **poem**. Since the pandemic started, there is  much less going on and it is getting hard to find inspiration, which has made many artists desperate (like- REALLY desperate) to find creative material to work with.

I am basing my video on a poem I wrote, and my intent is to raise  **existental questions** with it. I am driven by various philosophical works, such as those written by Camus or Jean-Paul Sartre.  I was  thinking of including some **horizontal de-saturated** shots that convey the  idea of **existentialism, isolation, self reflection**, etc. Some ideasinclude: Shots of people passing by on the street, people on the subway,  shots of a mirror reflection, shots of people walking by seen through  the reflection on a glass window of a shop, shots of scenes daily life  with lines of the poem written in it (ex. Shot of trash in the street  with line of the poem written on a piece of cardboard of trash), etc. It would help  me enormously if you could send me any shots that the poem inspired you to record, they could be as long as you’d like. **This project will be  shown to a big college audience, so it could be a great opportunity  since any work will be credited!**

Please send me any material to [beacotera@gmail.com](mailto:beacotera@gmail.com) , and your social media or contact you’d like me to credit. Make sure to also send me the  contact you regularly use so that I can send you the final video! Again,  any help would be enormously appreciated, and I sincerely thank you for your valuable help.

I attach an extract of the poem. Feel free to read the entire poem but use only these sentences in your shots!:

*Isn’t it ironic. We’ve been played. We may not have all the answers, yet  we’ve certainly been provided with a mind to speculate on them. We  don’t know more than our immediate reality, yet we have traces of the  universe all around us. We have senses, yet they do not serve the  purpose of infinity. Someone or something has thrown us into the world,  or maybe its the result of statistics. Either way, we have been thrown  into an abyss of uncertainty.*
