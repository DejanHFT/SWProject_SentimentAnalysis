Music recommendation with unique melodies,crapunzel965,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/xira7j/music_recommendation_with_unique_melodies/,5,0,"the title says it all, i’m looking for something that won’t bore me because i’ve heard it too much before, for example maybe even including orchestral elements (example cody fry). 
i’m thinking something along the lines of memories by conan gray,, goodbye yellow brick road etc. something that’ll move my feels   
it could be any tempo and stuff like diverse things (i listen to all sorts of music genres)
Just something rly unique that’s special in a way yk"
