Does anyone else ever feel Like they're all out of creativity?,Davie_Doobie,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/7i4i1f/does_anyone_else_ever_feel_like_theyre_all_out_of/,14,6,"I've been struggling with my artwork for years now. When I was younger I would draw things from sunup to sundown. Nowadays I sit there in front of a blank page and consider myself lucky if I ever make a mark on it. I get frustrated at my lack of ideas or my perfectionistic mind. To anyone else who deals with this, how do you get past it? I want to draw again, I want to develop, but I can't seem to overcome these obstacles.
