Finding inspiration when you are drained,Illustrious-Chest-52,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1601mu3/finding_inspiration_when_you_are_drained/,5,14,"In the beginning of August I finished the first edit of my manuscript. I was far from thinking it was perfect or that this is the final version. A few days after I finished, I started getting ideas on how to better my manuscript. I've been writing them down but I have absolutely zero inspiration. 

At the same time I feel weird when I am not writing. It sort or became a habit."
