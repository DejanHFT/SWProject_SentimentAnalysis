"TIL about Jim Rice, who in 1982 rushed the stands to help a 4 year old boy that was struck in the head by a line drive off the bat. Rice carried the boy onto the field, through the Red Sox dugout and into the clubhouse, where he was treated immediately. Jim's swift response saved the boy's life.",starkfr,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Rice#Community_activities,183,7863,No text content
