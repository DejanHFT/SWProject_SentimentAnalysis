However I don’t want it to stop there. So I want to write a part 2 but I am stuck with what the plot should be about so I want to ask if anyone’s got an idea. 

Here’s the plot of the original story:
A girl named Sarah lives a normal and quite boring life. But one day a boy takes her away from her Town, she and everyone in her town is in danger. Turns out an evil prince from another world is using everyone’s soul to create an army. In this world there is a prophecy that a girl named Sarah will help them. She agrees to help them in order to save her parents. After a long and dangerous journey they succeed in saving everyone and stopping the evil princes’ plan. She then returns to her own world, now with friends from another world and a whole kingdom that is grateful to her.

Where should it go after that? 

Appreciate any ideas<3"
