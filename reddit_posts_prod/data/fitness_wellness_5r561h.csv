Stalling on PPL after 8-9 months. Lift numbers are awful as well. Some other quick Qs as well.,dingleboot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5r561h/stalling_on_ppl_after_89_months_lift_numbers_are/,32,0,"I run the beginner PPL and my lifts are just awful after this time:

bench 40kg > 65kg

ohp 30kg > 42.5kg

DL 90kg > 115kg

squat 80kg > 100kg

barbell row 45 > 75kg

My bench press has stalled for around 3-4 weeks on 65kg. Some days I can do it for 4x5 and some I need to lower the weight. My diet is fully in check. I've been tracking every single day at 2850-3000cals. I'm 5ft10.

Bench press and OHP seem to be the only lifts that stall.

I'm not sure if it's the routine, but am I better off on another one? I've tried ICF. My goal is to put on mass and be athletic at the same time."
