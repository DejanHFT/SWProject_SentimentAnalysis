Does anyone know the status of Quantum Telescope research?,2FalseSteps,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/z809n2/does_anyone_know_the_status_of_quantum_telescope/,8,0,"I'm curious how far the development of Quantum Telescope tech/science has come, over the years.

Most of what I've found is several years old, and have found nothing up-to-date on the research and feasibility of such devices, today. Or, at least, any baby steps they've taken."
