My name is Bella and I want to talk to you about my weight loss journey

However, before I can talk to you about today, I have to tell you about the past. Looking back, I can tell you that this all began in my early childhood years. There were 3 serious factors that lead to my obesity. 

Number one was a serious lack of activity. The second factor was that I learned to use food as an emotional “coping” mechanism this meant that every time I was dealing with an emotion – sadness, happiness, boredom or anxiety – I would eat. The third issue was that I learned these habits directly from my family. This meant that I had no one to show me anything different, and the problem remained a problem for many years.

A few years afterward, I went to a follow up visit with my OBGYN and I was astonished to find out that I was in the 240’s – but amazingly enough, I still did nothing about it.

It wasn’t until 2010 when a routine doctor’s visit revealed that I still had impaired glucose levels that something finally clicked in my head. I knew that I had to get healthier, and I had to help my family learn healthy habits as well. That’s where my true weight loss journey began. I learned everything that I could about healthy eating and proper exercise and after some months i noticed that my weight is decrasing and now my weight has come to normal ; I’m still learning new things every day! I shared this information with my husband and he got on the bandwagon. Since then, my husband has made amazing progress; he is quite close to his ultimate goal and is dedicated to a healthy lifestyle.

On a personal note, I am well aware that I have made incredible progress, but I also recognize that I have a long road still ahead of me. I have to consistently remind myself why I am doing this and every day that passes it becomes more and more the norm in my life. I know that if I can do this anyone can… and I hope to inspire people to follow along to get healthy and feel great!

Thank you for taking the time to read this,
Bella
