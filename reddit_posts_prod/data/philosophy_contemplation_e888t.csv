"Yes, but is it really really real?  ",illogician,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/e888t/yes_but_is_it_really_really_real/,11,0,"Lately I've been contemplating the idea that the term 'real' should always be specified to a *context*.  Consider a few of the contexts in which we might encounter the term 'real':

'Real' sugar usually refers to a product of the sugar cane plant, as opposed to an artificial sweetener such as saccharine or aspartame.

A 'real' planet is one that has a certain size and a certain position in the solar system (e.g. it can't be orbiting another planet).  

'Real' breasts are those that grow 'naturally' on women - when enlarged by hormones they presumably maintain their 'reality' but when enlarged by silicone, in the common parlance, they are no longer 'real'.  

'Real' philosophy when invoked by a philosopher in the analytic tradition refers to analytic philosophy and when invoked by a continental philosopher is meant to apply to continental philosophy.  

'Realness' can be used to contrast virtual reality simulations with our 'ordinary' experience of our environment, fictitious stories with ones based in actual events, hamburgers made with beef with ones made from whatever the hell McDonald's uses, and well-established religions such as Christianity with farcical ones such as Pastafarianism.  

I have trouble seeing exactly what all these 'real' things (and various other purported 'real' things) have in common, so it seems to me that 'realness' should be specified to a context and the failure to do so creates semantic confusion.  

Even the grand idea of 'reality', when you examine it more closely, usually turns out to be specified in terms of our native human sensory instruments and/or the 'artificial' instruments we use to extend them, and what we notice or say about it seems to have a lot to do with *our* interests.  Is there an implied context here?"
