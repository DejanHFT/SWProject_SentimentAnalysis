Worlds Oldest Body Builder. Huge Motivation.,browncoww,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2zu735/worlds_oldest_body_builder_huge_motivation/,39,118,"I stumbled upon [this video](https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10153116315471469&pnref=story) this morning and what an inspiration to all of us. You can truly live longer and a fuller life with fitness. It is not just a fad, it is a way of life. You can stare death in the face and laugh. Just really motivated me and hopefully it will motivate others as well."
