"Mimicry, or Inspiration?",PeacefulSlumber,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/yenuzk/mimicry_or_inspiration/,19,5,"I have been infatuated with H.P Lovecraft’s descriptions and unorthodox writing style. His works “Dagon” and “Colour out of Space” are by far my favourites. I am currently in the process of writing my own book, maintaining the cosmic horror themes that are core to the works of Lovecraft’s literature. 

However, there are some things i am still unsure about. Lovecraft is know for his verbosity and unorthodox style, yet he has stated that he was not a fan of how he wrote. That is combined with his often exhausting description of minute details as seen in “At the Mountains of Madness”. 

Should I imitate his writing style? or utilise my own while maintaining essences of verbose descriptions and archaic language."
