What makes roasted veggies so tasty?,rickmickman,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/4bnacn/what_makes_roasted_veggies_so_tasty/,13,11,"Why does roasting make vegetables taste so amazing?  Just a little olive oil, salt and pepper and some time in the oven and you get some of the most delicious sides with practically no effort.  What's the science behind it?  Is it caramelization, dehydration and the concentration of flavor compounds, these and/or other processes?"
