Do you need motivation?,bat_dragon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/19n1dp/do_you_need_motivation/,17,35,"I was trying to find a way to inspire people around me to workout (I am self motivated/ lone wolf and have no problems myself). It's tough to find examples that you can use to motivate others.

But then, you come across someone that completely makes every excuse you make in life irrelevant.

I saw a quadruple amputee (has no legs or arms, probably lost them in war or something) wearing blades and running (Kind of like Oscar Pistroius but with no arms) . He had an mp3 player on but didn't have a place to strap it to. So he had it hanging around his neck and it was strapped around his chest.

We should have no excuses folks! "
