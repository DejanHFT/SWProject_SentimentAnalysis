"Informative Books on WWI, and Specifically the Sinai and Palestine Campaign?",LordOfTheGirth,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/8pdf7s/informative_books_on_wwi_and_specifically_the/,8,9,"Hi all,

Not sure if this post works in the vein of what is normally posted on here, but I need advice. I'm a sixth form student currently writing an IA on the Sykes-Picot Agreement. Can anyone recommend some informative books on either WWI or the Sinai and Palestine Campaign? I am looking to ground the essay in the wider context of the war. I also want some personal reading for the summer so any particularly interesting/insightful reads would be much appreciated.

NB: My main resources are 'The Balfour Declaration' by Jonathan Schneer and 'The Seven Pillars' by T.E. Lawrence."
