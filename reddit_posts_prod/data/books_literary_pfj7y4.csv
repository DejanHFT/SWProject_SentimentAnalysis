What is a book you heard a lot of good things about but were disappointed by after reading?,DJA1982,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pfj7y4/what_is_a_book_you_heard_a_lot_of_good_things/,6121,4210,"Is there a book you can remember hearing a lot of good things about, be it from friends, family, literary critics or social media, that yoy ended up reading yourself and were disappointed with because it failed to live up to the hype?

Was there any particular aspect that you felt did not live up to the hype? The plot maybe? Or the main character?

I remember all the hype surrounding The Da Vinci Code. The way it was marketed made one think it was the greatest literary achievement in the history of the written word. Needless to say it was a gigantic letdown after reading."
