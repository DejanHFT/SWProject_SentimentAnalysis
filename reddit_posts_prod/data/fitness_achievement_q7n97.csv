Achieving fitness through amateur sports,loser_face,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/q7n97/achieving_fitness_through_amateur_sports/,17,0,"Fitit,

I've been into sports/active my whole life and only recently got into the 'fitness for fitness sake' as I've phased into adulthood.  It's goddamned boring.  I find that, mentally, I need a *reason* to be fit.

What are some good intramural or amateur sports that are good for lifters to take part in? Something where strength plays a factor, but doesn't require a lot of equipment - here's a run down of what I've got:



T&F, Swimming, Soccer - Too cardio oriented and big slow people suck (hey, I still want to be *reasonably* competitive)

boxing/MMA/MA - No 'amateur' clubs nearby, potential partners all want to be pros someday, nothing just for fun.

football/hockey/lacrosse - Too much equipment needed.

LARP - Too nerdy, not enough exercise (I bet I could manage a great big axe pretty awesomely though)

Anything else theres a club for: Not fitnessy enough.

The only thing I've tried  that  might work is climbing.  I joined a club for a bout 3 months but the gap between 'beginner' and 'intermediate' seems to be jigagantic and it's not very team oriented.
