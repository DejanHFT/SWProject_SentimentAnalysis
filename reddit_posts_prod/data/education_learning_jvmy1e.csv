Combining Machine Learning and Learning Styles Theory,originaleditor,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/jvmy1e/combining_machine_learning_and_learning_styles/,7,1,"Hi, we're a team of data scientists and educators who have teamed up to build a platform to use machine learning and AI to create a bespoke educational experience. Our goal is to go deep on the machine learning side and provide a hyper-tailored environment. We're looking for folks to provide us with feedback, insights, beta test the product, and collaborate. Our goal is to sell this service, but to offer it free in lower income communities and where schools have teacher shortages.

If you know anyone interested, we have a few more spots in our beta program for Algebra 1 kicking off in January 2021.

thanks!"
