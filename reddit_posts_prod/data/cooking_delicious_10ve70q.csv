To make this, pour some salt and chili powder on chicken fillet, fry with olive oil a little and then leave it aside. now chop 1 garlic and 1 onion to small pieces and fry a little with 20 gram butter, then use 50 gram barberry(optional) and add some chopped coriander and mint and fry it for 1 and half to 2 minutes. Now add the juice of two blood orange or simple oranges to it(prepared beforehand). now add some soy sauce and chili flakes(optional). simply stir a little and put the fried chicken on top and there you have the food :D try it and you'll fall in love with the taste!
