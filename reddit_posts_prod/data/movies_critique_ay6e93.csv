Are we getting a too hostile when it comes to criticism?,Donna201299,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ay6e93/are_we_getting_a_too_hostile_when_it_comes_to/,198,196,"Media criticism is in a really unfortunate place right now and I don't think it will ever meaningfully improve until we (as a whole) start seriously thinking about not just the way we express our opinions in public forums but also how we form those opinions and how much effort we put into seriously considering those opinions and their true value in a discussion about a given piece of media/entertainment.

To put it rather bluntly. I think that we (as consumers) have a distorted perception of the value of our opinions on a individual level. Moreover, I think we have fostered a environment where we reject more structured, professional critical methodology in favor of emotional reaction and (more destructively) how entertaining the critique is even if that critique has evolved into outright personal insults, abuse, or even (in some cases) targeted harassment.

The kind of content we see from youtube Movie pundits is influenced by the extreme and often hostile positions that moviegoers take in just about every issue. As a result, when those very same respected and heavily followed pundits repeat those same cathartic, hyperbole-laden opinions back, that behavior becomes reinforced. Heck, even the (highly influential) streaming scene follows a similar setup where moviebuffs get the most extreme opinions reinforced because those are the opinions that get subscribers, views, and donations.

At this point, movie buffs who want serious movie discussions that are based on researched, factual, and emotionally balanced sources are a extreme minority that are constantly pushed down while the most extreme, most cynical discourse takes center-stage.

The sad part is that this is going to keep going. We have already influenced a whole new generation to not only continue this but to take it even further.
