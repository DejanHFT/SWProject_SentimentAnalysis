[UPDATE] My (24f) bf (27m) doesn't support my decission about my face and I don't know what to do anymore,ThrowRA_15698,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11ot709/update_my_24f_bf_27m_doesnt_support_my_decission/,88,1439,"You can find the original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11kj06k/my_24f_bf_27m_doesnt_support_me_in_my_decission/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

So, over the last few days I have been thinking a lot about this and I have had a serious talk with my boyfriend. By thinking I realized that I don't want the surgeries for myself, rather than to please strangers and having them to accept me. These are not good reasons for permanently alter your face. In addition, surgery scares the hell out of me. To sum up, I won't go under the knife. As soon as I can I will try to speak to a therapist about my self-steem issues. 

I feel a little sad, because it means that I will always have a weird face, and many people will judge me and reject me. But I don't want to lose myself and I don't want to risk loosing my boyfriend.

I then talked with him and made sure he knows that I understand why he reacted like he did and thanked him for helping me to see the truth. He was happy to know that I wasn't having surgery (He took my face in his hands and spent 5 solid minutes kissing my nose and my cheeks). He asked me not to do countouring on my nose nor getting my hair on my face with the purpose of hiding anything.

TLDR: I won't go under the knife, but I will see a therapist and I reconciled with my bf"
