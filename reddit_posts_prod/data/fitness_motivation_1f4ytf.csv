[Transformation Pics] 250-190lbs (5'11/M/18) Fat to Fit GREAT MOTIVATION,23x3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1f4ytf/transformation_pics_250190lbs_511m18_fat_to_fit/,337,1543,"http://i.imgur.com/V3klyKj.jpg

I've had an issue with my weight my entire life. Last year Jan2012 it was at its worst. I was over 250lbs and 1/3 of my body was fat, I knew something had to change. I got really motivated and dropped 60lbs in six months... I started to run and eat right during the week. The weight started shedding off and I kept true to my regiment no matter what. I was in great shape before I even knew it. When I started running (250lbs), I threw up after my first 1/2 mile run. Gradually I worked my distance up until I hit my longest run at 9 miles. I just hope this serves as inspiration to most, in a non-narcissistic kind of way. If you set your mind entirely to something, then you can and will succeed. Don't sit around and let things bother you, **FIX THEM!**

WEIGHT LOSS [-64lbs]:
*Jan 2012- (253lbs)
        to
*June 2012- (189lbs)  

DIET: Low Caloric and Low carb whenever I hit a plateau 
I didn't have a set diet regiment, I would eat boiled eggs every morning... it sucked but I had to. For lunch I'd pack a turkey sandwich w/ WHEAT bread and some fruit and veggies. For dinner I would just have whatever my parents made. 

ROUTINE: Diet doesn't matter so much when you're burning a crap ton of calories. I ran long distance to keep my heart rate elevated for long intervals and increased my mile distance weekly. Directly after running I would go immediately to the gym. I just did my thing in the gym. 
Mon- Chest, Triceps, Inner/Outter thighs, Neck, Abs... Tues- Back, Biceps, Quads, and Calfs... Weds- Shoulder, Traps, Lats, Lower back, Hamstrings, Abs.... Thur- I'd targeted specific areas I felt were being neglected. That's pretty much it... OH yeah and insane self-discipline  "
