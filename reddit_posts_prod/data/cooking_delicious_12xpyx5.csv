I’m in need of delicious recipes (meals/snacks/desserts) that Can be made in 20 minutes or less.,ThinProgrammer6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/12xpyx5/im_in_need_of_delicious_recipes/,30,37,"Long story short, at the start of last year I Got covid And ever since, i’ve had bad mental fatigue and headache. Before i Got sick, I enjoyed being in the kitchen. I am not the best, but i Can make good tasting stuff. The doctor recommended i cook, so here i am looking for recipes that take about 20 minutes or less. Oven or airfryer time not included
So far i Can only Think of Hash Browns and Swiss Roll.
Thanks in advance"
