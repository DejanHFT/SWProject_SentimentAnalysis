Marriage of Psychology & Neuroscience with Entrepreneurship. Participate in this research to make the most of your traits!,johanwiklund12,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/bc914z/marriage_of_psychology_neuroscience_with/,0,1,"  If you are running your own business or trying to start a business or just being involved in a new venture, you are invited to take part in a new exciting research project linking insights in psychology and neuroscience to entrepreneurship. The project is called *Entrepreneurship and Neurological Diversity*. It focuses on certain psychological traits, self-care, and entrepreneurial outcomes.

As a participant, you can receive your own personal profile, as well as a written summary of the findings so that you can benchmark yourself against other entrepreneurs. Some entrepreneurs are attracted to uncertainty and enjoy taking risks while others like planning. It is extremely important for you as an entrepreneur to understand yourself and make the most of your traits!

Please note that your responses are anonymous. Only aggregate data are analyzed and presented, and no individual can be identified. Here is a link to the survey:[ Entrepreneurship and Neurological Diversity](https://syracuseuniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cZoZZ9Sk2F23Tal)
