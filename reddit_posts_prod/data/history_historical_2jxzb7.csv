"""What can I do with a BA degree in history?"" Well, I'm a historic site manager for a county historical society in Minnesota. And here's how I'm trying to keep our organization relevant...",bruskadoosh,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2jxzb7/what_can_i_do_with_a_ba_degree_in_history_well_im/,205,1029,"Howdy /r/history,

I'm one of the lucky ones.  I've got an undergraduate degree in history and, amazingly, I'm actually working in the field.  

I've been the site manager of the [Warden's House Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Territorial_Prison) for the Washington County Historical Society for the last 2 1/2 years.  We're one of the oldest historical societies in the state and sit in a fortunate location which allows us to cover the earliest European settlement in the area. 

Now, when I came on board, I became the youngest site manager of the museum since the house opened as a museum in 1941.  When the other smaller historical organizations of the area occasionally meet-up, I'm generally the youngest person at these meetings by 20-30 years.

So I'm trying to do things a little bit differently than my predecessors.  Previous site managers arranged a heck of a lot of tea parties and book signings with very low attendance.  I've made it a major goal to try and regain some of our lost public interest.

I've held movie screenings, hosted the current Warden of the Minnesota State Prison, and this Saturday an amateur ""ghost hunting"" group is going to give a presentation on the Theories and Techniques of Paranormal Investigations...in a world where I'm competing against Netflix, we just have to try different things.

Which is why I'm posting on /r/history today...

First - to simply say that ""Yes!"" you can get an undergraduate degree in history and stay in the field. 

Second - to show off our totally remodeled [website](http://www.wchsmn.org). When I took over the role as the museum manager I also inherited writing and editing the society's e-newsletter...well since ""e-newsletters"" are very 2002 I'm transitioning our ""Historical Messenger"" to more of a blog-like model.  If you're interested, check out today's issue - ""[Finding History in Ghost Stories](http://www.wchsmn.org/historical-messenger/finding-history-in-ghost-stories/)"".

Third - Can I answer any questions you have? Minnesota history? Working with volunteers? Getting a job in history? Anything you'd like, I can at least take a stab at answering!

Thanks!

EDIT: Obligatory: ""Wow, I had no idea this would get so much attention!"" comment.

Thank you all for all your awesome questions and for helping generate a few more ideas for me to try at the ol' Warden's House Museum.  Since I've now been answering questions for 5 hours, I'm going to have to call it quits for the night and get some rest before I head back into the museum in the morning! If you're in Minnesota and near the Cities, here's my one last plug for our [Paranormal Event](http://www.wchsmn.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/smaller_paranormal_flyer.jpg) this Saturday, October 25th. It's going to be interesting folks.  Even if you aren't a believer, the Johnsdale guys have some pretty neat gadgets they'll be showing off.

In the morning, if there's a few new questions I'll try to address them, and if not, thank you guys again! I really appreciate all the well-wishes!
