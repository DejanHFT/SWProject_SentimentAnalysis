My [29F] boyfriend[22M] of just over a month thinks he may be asexual. help me to understand what it is and how to be supportive?,alianablueshadows,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/57s3hh/my_29f_boyfriend22m_of_just_over_a_month_thinks/,88,55,"My boyfriend is very sweet, kind, attentive and smart, funny and oh gosh is he just the most wonderful person..But he told me he wasn't sure he had a sex drive when we met. The other night though, things got a bit..heated and we messed around a little, heavy petting, manual stimulation etc. neither of us orgasmed though.


 On the long drive home from having dinner with his parents, he said suddenly that he thought we went too fast. I apologized, and I told him I felt badly that he was uncomfortable and that it was ok to step back and go back to the handholding we've been doing.That's when the following was said. ""I don't feel sexual desire for you. I've never felt it for anyone."" 


After some questions he ended up breaking down and crying. He said he felt like a freak, because seeing me naked did nothing for him. He said he didn't think I was ugly, just that he didn't have a desire to go ""past first base"". He felt like there's something wrong with him, and he's been ""looking for someone to give me that spark of desire that people talk about."" so i asked him if he felt it with me and he said no. He called me an hour or so after he got home from dropping me off and told me he wants to be with me, and he knows he cares, but he doesn't know what to do about the lack of desire for anything besides handholding and kissing, when his body responds like he wants more and makes us both confused. So I came here. 


I really want us to work, and I've never dated anyone who wasn't interested in at least oral. I don't know what questions to ask to make sure he's ok. I don't know how to help him feel better other than try to be comforting. and I know NOTHING about asexuality. so...what do i need to know? what can i do to help him feel less upset? how can i be supportive?

  **tl;dr**: boyfriend is asexual and i know nothing about it. said on the way home he feels like a freak. what do i need to know/do to be a good partner?

EDIT for clarity: i appreciate the feedback from all sides, but the question i have is how to be a supportive partner to an asexual person. not whether or not i should leave him. so i would appreciate less comments telling me to leave him when that wasn't what i asked. thank you!"
