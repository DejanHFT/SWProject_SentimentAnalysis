"[Serious] People with depression and anxiety, how do you find inspiration?",friendlius,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/7n7iqz/serious_people_with_depression_and_anxiety_how_do/,112,135,"I've seen many people say that they suffer from anxiety and depression and that writing helps them deal with it. I personally sometimes have attacks of the same but can't bring myself to write about anything because the same thing keeps occupying my head (i.e. the cause of the anxiety).

I am very curious to know, how do you people arrive at what to write about and how do you find the inspiration to write about it. "
