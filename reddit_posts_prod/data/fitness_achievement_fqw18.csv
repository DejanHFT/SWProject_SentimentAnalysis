I unlocked an achievement today...,punker2828,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/fqw18/i_unlocked_an_achievement_today/,49,33,"I finally got up to my first goal of benching 100 lbs. Coming from just curling 20's I'm pretty pumped. My next goals are 120, 180, and 270. My girlfriend and family are already noticing the difference, so that is always encouraging. I'm also training for the half marathon this year. 

It's hard to remember the person that used to get tired from walking up some stairs. And would play WoW all day. And eat so much everyday that I forgot what it felt like to be hungry. And not have a girlfriend. And have no purpose in life except new gear for my shaman. 

Thanks fittit. And seddit. "
