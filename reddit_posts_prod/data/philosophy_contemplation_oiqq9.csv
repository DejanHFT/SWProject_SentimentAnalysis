Any on-again of-again philosophy students out there?,DKdonkeykong,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/oiqq9/any_onagain_ofagain_philosophy_students_out_there/,4,1,"I always find myself going back to philosophy after a taking break from it. I read some books, ponder life, and engage in philosophical discussions on online forums. Then I become more and more preoccupied with real life. I eventually stop studying philosophy altogether. Repeat from step 1. Reading books from great philosophers really engages you and opens your mind. And occasionally you realize something extraordinary. But even after apparent revelations, I seem to come back to life unchanged. Perhaps its because of the views I hold. After studying philosophy and wondering through its contents, while trying to discover the truth about God or any ""higher power"", I came to the conclusion that there was no God. I don't know how the universe or life came to be, but it did. After realizing there was no God, I thought to myself ""how can anything *really* matter?"" If it's all subjective, nothing is really better or worse than anything else. I came to a point of nihilism, before I had even heard of the term. I delved into philosophy once more, then discovered the term nihilism, and others who thought as I do. For a several months I was extremely depressed. I saw the rest of the people on Earth as a bunch of folks living their meaningless lives, for no actual purpose. They all thought things actually mattered even though they did not. I realize this post is going off topic, away from my original point, nonetheless here we are... I eventually came out of the stage of depression I was in. But I felt I empty. I realized nothing *really* mattered, but it did not bother me. Since then I indulge in any activity that pleases me, not really giving life any serious thought. Just going through life like a stroll in the park, not really caring where I end up, as long as I am content. Now previously I said I came back unchanged from philosophy, and it seems I have just contradicted myself. I suppose when I said ""unchanged"", I meant ""not as changed as I would like to be."" You see, shortly after coming out of depression I started to read books by Nietzsche, and about his life and his thoughts. So many things he says seem to be grounded in truth. But they do not seem to change my ways. I understand what he's saying, but it does not much affect me. He describes the free spirit as accepting untruth as a condition of life. I interpreted it as nothing is really true, all truths are based on other things which are untrue. No matter how much you think and contemplate, it is all based on untruth. From what I understand, Nietzsche's free spirits find the truths that best suit them. Discovering, or inventing, their truths. The thing is, I am (mostly) happy where I am at, currently.(There are only few things I wish to do, that will put me in a position to enjoy life to the fullest, but I have yet to muster up the courage to do these acts. I suspect I will in the future, but it would mean breaking away from many aspects of my life, ones which been constant in it up to this point and I am having a hard time breaking away. But as they say, no pain no gain.) Well now I just came back from taking a huge shit, and seem to have lost my train of thought. So I'll end it here, and ask: Any students of philosophy find themselves engaged on and off in it, but wish they would be engaged more than they currently are, and don't get around to it as much as they like?                                                                                   
                  tl;dr - Too bad :("
