Strange win made me very motivated.,Jeffrey_Forbes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1hhxqb/strange_win_made_me_very_motivated/,36,32,"I have been trying to lose weight for the past couple months, because I let myself go at least 25 pound my first year of college. My favorite pair of shorts the summer before I started college were a size 34, and two months ago the idea of me fitting into them was a joke, I almost gave them away. However this morning I woke up after a great day of exercising and dieting and decided for some reason to try them on and they fit. I know this seems small and insignificant, but i had to wear 38s most of the past few months and it's great to see that all my hardwork is actually paying off because it's difficult sometimes to see fat loss even if you know it's probably occuring. Any of you guys ever get motivated by strange little wins like this?"
