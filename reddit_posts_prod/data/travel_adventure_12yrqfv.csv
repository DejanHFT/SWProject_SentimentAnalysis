Travel & A less adventurous spouse,JSchecter11,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/12yrqfv/travel_a_less_adventurous_spouse/,16,1,"I'm wondering if anyone else can empathize and share how they handled similar situations.

I've always loved to travel, and I've lived abroad in North Africa and Europe. When I met my spouse, she had never left the continental United States. She travelled a lot with her family in their RV and treasures those memories, which is great. For context, her parents don't like to go out to dinner in the city near us because 'it's dangerous to be out after dark'. Trust me- it's really not, but this was how she was raised so we're dealing with all that baggage.

I have gotten her out of her comfort zone over the past 10 years, but so far she has only been willing to travel to resort destinations in the Caribbean and Western Europe.  

In a recent conversation, she was sharing how she is excited to travel the US with our young child. I mentioned that when our kid's older (currently a toddler) I'd love to bring them with Morocco and share that with them. She instantly freaked out and said I am never allowed to take my child there because it isn't safe. A place I lived in, and loved deeply, to which she has never stepped foot in. 

I kind of always figured I'd just keep gently pushing her boundaries and eventually I'd get her to go to lots of cool places with me- but now I'm concerned that parenthood has actually made her more resistant to travel. We also get limited vacation time form our work, so we aren't the kind to go on vacations without each other.  

I have so many places I want to see in my life, I don't want to sacrifice my sense of adventure but I also value my family and want to share it with them. I'm feeling a bit stressed about it at the moment, so I'd appreciate hearing from anyone who has gone through this or something similar before before."
