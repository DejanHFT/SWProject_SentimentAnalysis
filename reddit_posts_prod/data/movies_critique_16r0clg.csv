What’s up with people using budgets as a critique to review movies nowadays?,Texas_Totes_My_Goats,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16r0clg/whats_up_with_people_using_budgets_as_a_critique/,35,0,"I have been an avid movie fan my whole life. Prior to the last few years, I don’t recall most viewers or critics highlighting a movie’s budget in their reviews. It’s usually all about the story, the dialogue, the cinematography, the special effects,  the direction, or the acting. There are exceptions, like Water World, but the budget was usually the last thing someone talks about when rating a movie.

I notice a lot of the recent budget heavy reviews seem to be against Disney, so I don’t know if it’s political or just part of the recent anti-Disney spam. It’s not as though we didn’t have big budget movies in the past, including big budget movies that were poorly received or failed at the box office. One of the most egregious recent examples I saw was someone calling out Avatar 2’s budget in a review about Mario. Basically, “one of the best looking video game movies of all time and didn’t have half the budget of Avatar 2”. That just seems like a pointless point, considering the movies are different genres, different types, and have little in common. They didn’t even open on the same weekend. 

I thought maybe this was a new Gen Z thing, but I see other Milennials and Gen X taking this new budget stance as well. Though it’s definitely targeted, because movies like the latest Mission Impossible got a free pass by most. It’s also not targeted against box office failures because even successful movies get slammed over their budgets. I wanted to get the sub’s thoughts. Is this new trend here to stay or just the latest troll fad?"
