Looking for G Adventures Central America tour feedback,n-ani,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/yslqbs/looking_for_g_adventures_central_america_tour/,2,2,"Hi there,
I’m wondering if anyone has done the G Adventures Volcano Trail: Waves & Local Ways tour? If so, did you find the long travel to be worth it? And did you ever feel unsafe in any of the places visited (or en route to them)? 

I think the itinerary overall is exciting, but I worry that its going to feel like the whole trip is just spent in transit and everyone I talk to about it thinks I’m crazy for wanting to go to El Salvador and Honduras saying that they are unsafe. 

Alternately, I’m considering doing one of the G Adventures tours that just go through Costa Rica at a slower pace, so if anyone has experience with any of those, I would love to hear it!

For context, I’m a female in my late 20s with a fair amount of travel experience in Europe and Southeast Asia (both through solo and group tours) but this will be my first time travelling through Central America. I’ll be joining the trip solo."
