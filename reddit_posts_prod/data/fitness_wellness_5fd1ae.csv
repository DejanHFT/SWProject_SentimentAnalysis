"M29|5'3"" Progressed well, now time for bulking",usuli,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5fd1ae/m2953_progressed_well_now_time_for_bulking/,27,98,"I started to workout and reduced my intake around some 11 months ago. I am 29 years old and 5'3"" tall. I was about 68kg last December. 

My current weight is 53kg. So I last 15kgs in the last 11 months.

I worked out everyday ((Day 1 - Chest, Shoulders, Arms Day 2 - Ab workouts)) and reduced my intake to 1200kcal a day.  Avoided sweets, dairy and fried foods.

Current Stats(Initial Stats): all stats are in inches

neck- 13.2 (15.2)
Bust - 32.2 (35.5)
waist - 27.4 (33.5)
Hips - 29.2(35.7)
buttocks - 32 (36)
thighs - 17.6 (22.5)
calves -12 (11.5)
Upper arm - 10.2 (13)
forearm - 9.3 (10)



I was happy till I reached 55kgs. But after that I really wanted to build some muscle but I continued losing it. Now my body is hovering around 53kgs. 

And moreover people around me started asking me 'is there anything with your health?'. They were afraid that I am becoming ugly and losing by chubbiness. I initially thought that they were just reacting to my weight loss. But later I realized that they were right. I am loosing too much of weight and I lost the control over my weight. 

So what happened?

When I was cutting I carefully selected my foods and calculated the calories using a spreadsheet everyday to be maintained around 1200kcal. After lost my target weight I couldn't eat more since every time I reach 1300kcal or more I got panicked. I thought I will be slowly putting on weight and end up again where I started.

And I was working out as regularly. More than working out I have to walk to work to and fro. That is about 8km a day. Google Fit says I burn about 400kcal per day through this walking. 

My intake? still 1300-1400kcal a day. (I feel guilty and heavy if I eat more)

So can you help in building up my muscles and improving my weight. 


1. What weight would be appropriate for my height (5'3"")? (Should I follow BMI)

2. How much calories I should consume, considering bulking, everyday workouts and my endless walking? 1500kcal or more?

3. Should I eat clean? I am a vegetarian and what are the foods that may help me to put weight?

4. Should I stop working out for sometime and wait for me to put weight and then continue workouts or continuously workout?

Thanks
