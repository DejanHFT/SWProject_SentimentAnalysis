I can’t understand anything I learn,legend999999999,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/xktcd1/i_cant_understand_anything_i_learn/,23,17,I’m in grade 12 and I feel so overwhelmed currently. All the topics in my classes just leave my brain and I feel like I’m learning nothing despite how important it is to do well this year to get into university. I really enjoy engineering and programming classes but this semester is killing me with calculus 12 physics 12 pre calculus 12 & programming 12. Everything I learn just feels like it doesn’t make sense and I can’t get myself to study. I feel so lost.
