A Case Against Religion,Dewinna_Daraelist,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/8jscfs/a_case_against_religion/,18,5,"A different take on existence


   As we are born into this world we have little to no “perspective”, making us malleable to changing views, but as we mature these different angles at which we view the world begin to get more locked in place, though not necessarily because they’re stuck. It’s just these views of life have been formed from so many experiences that no small experience will move them, similar to Newton's first and second laws respectively. 


   There are countless views we can have on life, political, ethical, ideological, etc. Each view has countless “angles” which you can look from, taking different variables into account each with different relative values. While views can have countless angles to be perceived from, that doesn’t mean every view has been looked at from every angle. This statements most basic justification would be that innovations are inherently made from looking at something in a different way than anyone has before in one way or another. Innovations allow greater access to new angles to view things, much like CPU’s getting improved upon year after year building off the improvements in years past. Views without a physical counterpart on the other hand have less mobility as “improvements” or changes in general aren’t accessible in the same way; we can’t form more complex views upon ideas we haven’t thought of, and we can’t gain access to those ideas without having them shared with us. 


   When it comes to the general view of “existence” I think we as humans perceive it from an angle that’s overrepresented. This is an angle where the universe exists for us, not to say that religion inherently expresses this sentiment, but it certainly perpetuates it. We are born into societies which ask us which religion we identify with, rather than if we identify with religion at all. This sets up an angle on existence that is apparently unlikely to change, one where we are a existentially unique, where we have reason; value which exists outside this universe. I think we possess something existentially unique, but it’s in no way bound solely to humans, and that’s consciousness. It may seem unnecessary to make this distinction that we possess something unique without being unique ourselves, but it’s as important as making the distinction that we are in the middle of the observable universe without being in the middle of the entire universe.


    Here is where it’s easy to fall into the pit of nihilism and say that without inherent value everything automatically has no meaning, but one must avoid this dead end route to reach what I see as a truthful view of existence. This view is that we don’t own our lives and being, that we compose the universe in the same way as rocks, except we are beings which have the ability to perceive. The universe evolves in chaos on a large scale, but within it are (surely multiple) regions of consciousness. These regions if like our own evolve in a different way, rather than losing energy seemingly endlessly, we come from little energy and build; bacteria to societies. This isn’t “us” which builds society though, as it’s dependent on all the evolution which came before us both physically and in ideas. The universe created the societies, just we are the channel it used, not necessarily consciously but not inherently unconsciously. 


    Hopefully this basis for an underrepresented angle at which to perceive existence makes some sense, we aren’t here because we’re special, on the contrary we are just parts of events in a seemingly endless series that began with the big bang (or at least in this universe and as far as we know.) Still might feel nihilistic without intrinsic value set upon us as man seems unsatisfied with accepting value existing solely because we care about what we value, being one of many voids that many of us fill with religion. Yet we only impulsively see this as making us empty and worthless because different views that have built our perspective where the entire universe is in existence for us. Why would it be? Humans aren’t holy, while acknowledging that good people exist, we can’t ignore that many live parasitically, that we as humans don’t provide anything for the universe, only for ourselves; why would the universe be created just so we can exist? That’s an opinion that the conclusion and impacts of this don’t rely on, still just something worth considering to ease the transition if you care to understand my perspective. We aren’t given life like some holy creatures, we possess consciousness that has come from millions of years of evolution that began with beings that weren’t self aware. Like plants we are a byproduct of the chain of events that have made up the time up to now in the universe, unlike plants we are aware, and more importantly we can consciously change the world around us. This has allowed things to exist in the universe that never would have come from unconscious matter; cars and shit. But while we built and created cars (and shit), we are still the universe, thus the universe naturally created cars through us. That is our value, we are expanders of existence, parts of the universe which create new ideas, new technology, if successful we improve our surroundings, become civilizations which rose from the chaotic universe. (Which I find to be pretty remarkable)


   Without religion there’s nothing “above” conscious beings, no “right” no “wrong”, only what we see to be right and wrong. The universe’s opinions on ethics are as chaotic as it’s physical state, and those opinions are the sum of all our own; again, we ARE the universe. Our value as beings which cause internal expansion exists in the universe just as the universe exists in our awareness. Still, outside of the universe, if this value has greater purpose then it’s beyond what we can perceive, as it’s outside the universe and we are stuck inside the universe (or at least our consciousness is for the time in which we live.) This makes ideas of things outside of the universe such as god completely improvable, can’t prove the lack of existence of anything outside the universe either, but it’s practical to state existence as a quality of the universe, rather than something that can be outside it.


   Our value within the universe exists as surely as the universe itself exists, but that doesn’t mean the universe itself (thus us) has value outside itself. What’s at the end of this seemingly endless stream of events? If nothing then what started it all to begin with, as before we can even think about “why” we need to know “how” for theories to be anything but shots in the dark. These questions I don’t intend to have an answer for in this life, but they aren’t relevant within the universe so practically there’s no use to ponder them until further development on the “how”. Instead, be grateful to be able to be able to experience pleasure, that existence has so many good qualities, let happiness come from that and focus on those good qualities, for there’s no true reason to be happy or unhappy, but one is more enjoyable than the other. 

For purpose, expand the universe, spread ideas that you feel to be underrepresented, bring creations into this universe that will forever have existed because you made them, that will be built off of later. Use that unique quality of awareness we possess to its full extent by continuing to build off of what the universe has put in front of you, though you will die, those events will be built off of by generations following us, you will have made your mark. Even if the universe eventually ceases to exist, you’ve made your mark, time only exists in space, space must exist to be space, and to exist is to be in the universe. Even if the universe if a blip of time within a void of nothing, isn’t that beautiful? We were able to LIVE, be AWARE, and hopefully after this life, before this life, after this universe, before this universe, there is more. It may not be apparent as we don’t have access to perceive it, but if what we can’t perceive follows the same rules as what we can then this universe is one event of a series, the answer to “why” isn’t reachable, but there being a reason which we can’t currently know is deductible. It isn’t provable, but that’s where my faith is placed, not in a god but a reason for existence in general. 

    What’s funny is this angle is so close to the same which I feel to be overrepresented. I still feel we have value that exists outside this universe, it’s just the reason isn’t just scribbled in (god) to seal the cracks that we aren’t able to fill. And it’s impractical to consider our role outside the universe rather than within it, that’s not to say ethics is a quality that necessarily exists solely within the universe, but to be ethical is to make the universe more ethical; universe isn’t fair, but neither are we, the more people which act fairly, the fairer the universe is (again, we are the universe.) 


The god angle is problematic for various reasons but there are two which I find most important to discuss. Arguably my view is problematic in its own ways. Social control is one, but what is “control”? We don’t have control of society with or without “rules” which religion make, trying to make society the society you like by doing your part is how society is composed with or without said rules. Taking the rules away we are forced to think for ourselves, it forces self accountability when it comes to views rather than justifying through religion. Shitty people will exist if religion were to be less dominant in society, but they exist now too and many warp religion to justify views which ethically are unjustifiable. The other main reason is suicide, it’s easy to say “don’t kill yourself” but hard to say why. The truth is, to me, nothing should stop you from having that choice, it’s a choice that can’t be undone and I think many times it’s a mistake but it’s a choice which is only your own to make. For those who are in a terrible place and contemplate suicide though, religion telling them not to may keep some alive, but that can prevent them from finding their own “why” as that reason must exist within the universe and if they look to find it through religion, they are trying to look outside this universe and that just can’t be done. 


    Religion has its benefits as well, this is not to discredit religious people, any people, it is not to insult the intelligence of those whose views don’t align with my own. This is for people like me, who grew up scared that they have evil within them because they just can’t believe what they’re told to believe, in something that doesn’t make sense to them. This is to let people like that know that they don’t need  to believe to be a good person, that they can choose the ethical choice without a book to validate their reasons, and that making the right choice isn’t done by having a god on your side but through self transparency and discipline."
