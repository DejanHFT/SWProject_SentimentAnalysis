How much weight training if any would I need to achieve something similar to these?,BadManneredK1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/243ycz/how_much_weight_training_if_any_would_i_need_to/,34,6,"I'm 167cm and around 135 pounds. I was wondering how much of a diet and weight training would I need to get physiques similar to these? Ohh and I currently do Muay Thai and BJJ training. Should I just stick with those and add a diet with some regular cardio or should I get some diet in there too?
