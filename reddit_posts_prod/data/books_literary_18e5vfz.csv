Who is the best literary villain?,mzingg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18e5vfz/who_is_the_best_literary_villain/,324,388,"I just finished reading Jack London’s “The Sea-Wolf” and damn, Wolf Larsen was such an insane but thought provoking character. The descriptions of his physical appearance were incredible and his philosophical nihilistic dialogue was  mind blowing. And the book itself was a thrilling page turner. He seemed like a calmer, more defined Ahab and the book was a more exciting Moby Dick.

  
So who are the best antagonists of all time? And why? What is it about them that makes them complex, surprising, sympathetic, etc.?"
