>In *Across the Spider-Verse*, Miles’ identity takes center stage, but not totally in the ways you might expect. The film retains its signature tone — moving between humor and sentimentalism with a light touch — but there’s a greater effort now to connect Miles’ origin story to broader lessons about superhero canons. That doesn’t always land as gracefully, and parts of *Across the Spider-Verse* feel weighed down by this need to belabor a well-established point. Still those moments can be forgiven as the story unfurls, revealing that Miles, with his new challenges, remains a hero worth rooting for.

>They’ve done it. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” doesn’t just extend the tale of Miles Morales. The film advances that story into newly jacked-up realms of wow-ness that make it a genuine spiritual companion piece to the first film. That one spun our heads and then some; this one spins our heads even more (and would fans, including me, have it any other way?).

>*Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse* It’s a film that thrives in its complexity and flourishes in its commitment to authentic storytelling. Despite a slightly convoluted plot, it’s a memorable journey where writers Lord, Miller, and Callaham understand how to formulate a comics adaptation. This latest addition to the Spider-Verse canon reminds us why we love superhero narratives — not just for the action but for their humanity.

>Across the Spider-Verse isn't just easily one of the best films of 2023 and one of the best animated films in years, it's also in the running for best superhero film ever, and arguably cements Miles Morales as the best Spider-Man we've seen on the screen so far.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-review) (8/10):

>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse surges with visual inventiveness and vibrance in an undeniably strong evolution of the style established in Into the Spider-Verse. Miles and Gwen’s search for their place in the multiverse is relentless and exciting, almost to a fault, and though the plot is often an afterthought to the pure chaos of creation on display, strong performances and character arcs that feel true to the heroes we met last time help ensure that Across the Spider-Verse is a more-than-worthy follow-up to an all-time classic.

>Visually astonishing, emotionally daring, this spectacular sequel has enough wit, imagination and thrills to fill several worlds. But prepare to be left hanging till the sequel hits screens.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1300967/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-review/) (7.5/10):

>Now Miles is back with ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"" a sequel that's bigger and bolder than the first ... and also incomplete. By making this the first of two films, writers Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and David Callaham have crafted a movie that doesn't really feel like a movie — it's just a chapter. An exciting chapter, sure, but an unfinished chapter that runs out the clock, torpedoing all the momentum it was building in the process.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-review-sequel-1234868823/) (A-):

>”Into the Spider-Verse” was astute and funny, complicated and emotional, unique and daring, and its sequel only grows and expands on those aims. If the first film showed what superhero movies could be, “Across the Spider-Verse” goes even further: It shows what they should be. In a genre built on the literally super and special, these films are unafraid to stand out and do something truly different, something that pushes the limits, to show the genuine range available to this subset of stories and feel damn good in the process (and look, dare we say, even better).

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse/) (5/5):

>Across The Spider-Verse cranks every dial to 11, and somehow doesn’t collapse in on itself. Visually astonishing, emotionally powerful, narratively propulsive — it’s another masterpiece.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-review/):

>“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” doesn’t just tell a Spider-Man story, it takes the whole Spider-Man formula — a chance encounter with a radioactive spider, plus tragedy, equals hero — and transforms it into an oppressive, morally questionable dogma. The leader of the Spider-Men, Miguel O’Hara (Oscar Isaac), aka Spider-Man 2099, believes all their existences are defined by the deaths of innocent people around them. So those people have to die, don’t they?
