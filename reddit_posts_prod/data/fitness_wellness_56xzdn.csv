"Remember my video on how to do the Perfect Lunge to Stretch your Hip Flexors? Well, here is the PART TWO of it so you could progress that stretch to the next level and get even more hip extension!",Antranik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/56xzdn/remember_my_video_on_how_to_do_the_perfect_lunge/,43,1302,"**Background:** A couple weeks ago I showed you[ how to do the perfect lunge to effectively stretch your hip flexors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/54fphc/the_hip_flexors_are_the_muscles_near_the_front_of/) which include [the muscles](http://i.imgur.com/2dsH73F.jpg)  near the front of the thighs and hips.

**PART TWO: How to progress the lunge into a more epic stretch!**

* I just uploaded [the follow-up video, which takes the lunge position and *adds a foot-bind*](https://youtu.be/7D3eyJpUj_o) so you could **fully** stretch all the quadriceps and deeper hip flexors and open up your hips even further.  

* I was almost going to scrap this video but given how much support the original post got, I decided to not be afraid and just do it, so I hope this helps you!

##**Benefits:**

* Many people who don't stretch their hip flexors have often lost all hip extension and need to restore it. Stretching them will help your hips **have more hip extension** (read: the ability to bring your thighs behind you without arching the lower back to compensate).

* Lunges are also a commonly prescribed basic stretch if someone is having lower back pain, because the iliopsoas complex (deep hip flexor) connects the thighs to the lower back, and if they're tight they pull on the lower back. Doing it in a low lunge is a very good start toward stretching them.

* Adding the foot-bind as outlined in the video will help to stretch ALL the quadriceps (as opposed to only the rectus femoris in a basic lunge) and target the deeper hip flexors more.

* The beauty of this progression is you don't really need equipment once you could start grabbing the foot.
