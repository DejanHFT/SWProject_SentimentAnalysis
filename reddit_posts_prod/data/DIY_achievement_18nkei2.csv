Wood glue and foam,Sinister_Minister101,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/18nkei2/wood_glue_and_foam/,5,2,"Hi, I’m new to DIY construction projects (like very VERY new), but in an attempt to try to gain some move life skills, I have endeavoured to take on a task that I might otherwise have tried to get someone to help me with. I just want to complete this project from start to finish on my own and if I do so I will feel a sense of tremendous achievement.

Now that my life story is out of the way lol, I was hoping someone might be able to provide me with some help with a particular question. I’m new to the group so if I’m asking this in the wrong place then please feel free to delete it or ask me to and I will delete it.

My question is whether or not I can use PVA wood glue to stick XPS foam to a wooden background (edge of foam to flat side of wood)? I am aware that some adhesives dissolve foam, and I wasn’t sure if this was one of them. So I guess my questions are, A) will wood glue adequately hold roughly 1ft square piece of XPS foam in place (I also plan to use expanding foam around the edges for additional support, and B) if not, is there anything else I could use for this task?

Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks so much!"
