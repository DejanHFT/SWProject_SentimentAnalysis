I Made Spam Fried Rice And It Was Surprisingly Delicious,gentle_but_strong,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/8vkb5q/i_made_spam_fried_rice_and_it_was_surprisingly/,246,895,"Iâ€™d never tried Spam before and refused to succumb to the rumors of its disgusting effect on the palate. So, I whipped up something everybody loves - fried rice - and topped it with green onion and sriracha. We were moaning with every bite, even after my boyfriend swore up and down that he hates Spam. And the total cost of everything was probably less than ten bucks, so this is definitely a college student friendly meal. 

Edit: I included soy sauce, peas and carrots, diced onions, two large eggs and garlic powder in my recipe! "
