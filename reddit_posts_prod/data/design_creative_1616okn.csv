How to overcome creative blocks,Purple-Corgi-952,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/1616okn/how_to_overcome_creative_blocks/,7,4,"Hey guys , I’m a product designer and this days I just keep feeling all my designs are ugly , I can’t seem to think of anything new , I go to several sites for inspiration but still I’m not getting anything , I have so many project ideas in my head but bringing them to life virtually has become impossible for me , I can’t seem to create beautiful designs anymore or any design at all , I just stare at my computer with no idea how to start , I don’t know if any other designer has experienced this , please I need advice or if there is any book anywhere that can help ,thanks"
