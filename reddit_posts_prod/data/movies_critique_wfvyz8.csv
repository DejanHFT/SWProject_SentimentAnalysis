Too long interpretation of Riley Stearns' Dual (2022) that answers some of the critiques.,PolarOppossum,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/wfvyz8/too_long_interpretation_of_riley_stearns_dual/,9,40,"I watched Riley Stearns' new film Dual and after reading and watching some other's thoughts about it, I think I interpreted the ending a bit differently which possibly answers some of the critiques. Mainly that Sarah should not haven fallen for the poison trick and the film is excessively cruel to Sarah in the first act.

I've seen people talk about how Sarah falling for Sarah Double's trap and drinking the water was uncharacteristic at that point in the film. After all her training and preparation, the Sarah we have at the end of the film never would have fallen for that. But I don't think she did. As soon as Sarah noticed that Sarah Double's brought a bag that was nowhere big enough for the trip, Sarah knew that there were no plans for them to escape and that the Double planned to kill her.

After realizing that, Sarah immediately returned to the mindset and motivation of wanting to cause the Double as much pain and harm as possible. What would cause the Double more misery than forcing her to live the life that Sarah was so miserable in and, in the end, so happy to leave? With her training she could probably kill the Double quickly and continue to escape across the border, but that would almost be giving the Double mercy.  Once she decided she wanted to cause the Double as much pain and hurt as possible, forcing her to live that life would be the most cruel and pain inducing option. She accepts her death to achieve that. That is why she says they will wait until the first break to check for weapons. At this point Sarah doesn't know how the Double is going to kill her, so she is keeping the opportunity for the Double to kill her with her weapon before that first break. It is only after she is offered the water that she realizes it would be poison.

Sarah's entire motivation for living was to get back at the Double for stealing her life. Sarah shows almost no emotion at being told she is going to die in the beginning and even mentions that the fact she is going to die doesn't bother her, it's the waiting and not knowing when that is the worst. The Sarah we are introduced to doesn't want to be alive, or at least is ambivalent about it. She only becomes more livelier when the Double takes her life and she is motivated for revenge. That is her entire motivating force. She doesn't actually want her past life back, she is angry at the audacity of the Double to steal her life and the audacity of her family to chose the Double over her and wants revenge. Once she realizes that the Double plans to kill her, Sarah flips back to wanting revenge. This is also established earlier in the film when after becoming friendly with the Double she immediately goes back to wanting to kill when she thinks the Double is playing mind games with her with the support group. Giving her life to cause the Double misery wouldn't be out of character for Sarah with that mindset. In affect, she is fulfilling her fate of dying a painless death of some nameless ""disease,"" a fate that she had already accepted once already.

It's established that in the support group meeting that a lot of doubles are pretty depressed and miserable with their lives. I think one of them even mentions there is no escape. It is also mentioned that a lot of the time the Double does not end up meshing with the family. This mixed with the scenes where Sarah talks with Peter and the scene where Sarah and the Double have heart to heart, the seeds are planted that the Double is entering the same cycle of misery with cruel and irritating people that Sarah was so depressed in and is likely going to experience the same sadness that the other Doubles do.

This is also why it is so important that the world is so cruel to Sarah in the first act. It establishes how awful Sarah's life is and how unloving and overbearing the people in her life are. It makes the thought of living that life a hell and drives home the misery that the Double is going to have to live with.

The final scene of the film, with the Double breaking down after being overwhelmed by daily existence, lets the viewer know that Sarah did, in the end, end up besting the Double in the dual.

Idk this was probably way too long for a film no one really seems interested in and doesn't necessarily support the themes that I felt like were being touched on, and maybe this interpretation was really obvious to everyone else, but I had a few gummies this evening and this film got me thinking."
