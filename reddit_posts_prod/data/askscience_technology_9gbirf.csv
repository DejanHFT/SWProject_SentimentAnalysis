What are the theoretical limits of thermionic vacuum tube technology?,MisterRzzzzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/9gbirf/what_are_the_theoretical_limits_of_thermionic/,3,2,"As we know, thermionic tubes were largely replaced by semiconductors in the mid-20th century, as the latter technology features a number of advantages, including cost, efficiency, reliability and size... Now suppose, for the sake of discussion, semiconductors were never discovered or invented, and we had to try and improve thermionic tube technology instead. Could thermionic tubes have been made significantly more reliable, and possibly even miniaturized? Is it theoretically possible to build something like a crude integrated circuit with lots of tiny tubes instead of transistors?"
