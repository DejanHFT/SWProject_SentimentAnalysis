A Lover's Critique of Tulip Fever,rainvest,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6xu41x/a_lovers_critique_of_tulip_fever/,0,1,"The first few seconds of the trailer vaulted me from the lunch table to see it.  I hate trailers that try to explain the whole movie - although that should have been taken as a bad omen in this case. Yesterday was a rainy Saturday, and I needed something.  In the one-screen local theater, I sat in a perfect seat, ready to be overwhelmed.

The opening voiceovers did it: I was overwhelmed with irritation.  In fact, the whole first half was painfully ham-handed in the shaping our emotion, trying to use incessant sweeping music and shaky and short cuts to rush through the important points of character and story so we could just feel already.  At times I verbally castigated the director for not holding longer and just letting me look at the gorgeous setting and the impeccable costumes - and the really very pretty cast.

However, by the time the very threads of the story had become all tangled and taut, I was short of breath, watching with my hands over my mouth.  I had no clue what was going to happen and wanted more than anything for it to be resolved - somehow.  Regarding the climax at a distance, I could say that the moral dilemmas could have been more developed and that beats of the painful revelation/resolution weren't tight enough, but in the moment - gahh, I felt my heart wrenched.

Why?  How could something be so inept in its handling of breath-taking material and still have a magic?  Perhaps I was in just the right tender, receptive mood, but perhaps it was that the only flaw was that the right elements were only shown poorly.  In the moment, though I had not had time to fully sit with feelings, I knew what was at stake.  I had churning pot of beautiful images showing those stakes while I was waiting to see what would happen at the birth - the merchant was begging the doctor, if it came down to it, to save his orphaned, picturesque, adulterous wife rather than her child, who was actually the servant's child by the fishmonger who was dragged off to sea after losing tulip money in a drunken fit caused by confusing the merchant's wife for his own lover on a rendezvous with her painter who is at that very moment trying to sell the very same passing rare tulip to run away with the merchant's wife after she fakes her death in this childbirth.  I was enthralled.

It is this trance that the movie is about.  The Dutch tulip craze, perhaps unique in economic bubbles, was about beauty.  With that came all the usual societal markers of ownership, but foremost, the desire to own came from nothing other than appreciation of a fine, natural, ephemeral aesthetic.  The two moments that clinch the climax that absolutely needed more time, even though they were given generous time by the movie's own meager standards, were when the characters at the center of this drama emerged from their fascination - the merchant from his self-possession, and his wife from her passion.  Her last words as she breaks from the plan - the thought must have been developing as the drifted through the mirror-calm Amsterdam canals in a coffin, but I did not recognize it until I snuck back into the theater for a second viewing -her last were ""Tell him the fever broke.""  I too was touched with this fever, caught up merely in the romance of this young unsatisfied wife and her starving artist lover, not sure if I wanted her to succeed with her deception or to reconcile with her pitiful husband, but feeling involved all the same.

The movie's only but crippling flaw is its style of editing.  It could easily have been twenty minutes longer just by letting the shots (which would have been better still) go longer.  I need to sit in a moment to feel a character.  Yes, the tulip-trading scenes are good in their pace, as are the rushing-about-the-town scenes, but when a character chooses to do something, let me watch them mull and consider with them their dilemma, a very rich experience if the viewer has been shown (not explained) the elements of the dilemma.  I credit Tom Stoppard with the set-ups in the screenplay, engineering a well-rounded understanding of character's desires and hang-ups, as well as the original book which I expect created them this fully.  I just wish the film had let us enjoy and get carried away by the moments it was presenting as beautiful.  Otherwise, the tragedy and the recoil of the fever breaking is not wounding, awe-inspiring, cathartic, challenging, even beautiful in itself, and understandable - it is only a phlegmatic illustration of consequence.

I still loved this movie.  Then again, I was looking to be carried away by it - which is what it tried to be about.  Feelings take time, and like a strain of tulip, they cannot be engineered with certainty, only properly cultivated and allowed to grow."
