What courses can I do to learn about business and finance.,Off-Spinner07,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/15aelhk/what_courses_can_i_do_to_learn_about_business_and/,6,1,"Hi everyone,

I'm a computer science engineer and I'm interested in learning more about business and finance. I don't have a lot of business knowledge, but I'm hoping to gain the skills and knowledge I need to run a business in the long term. I'm wondering if anyone can recommend any courses or resources that would be helpful for me. 
I am slightly inclined towards the online courses which are offered by different universities but any suggestions are welcome.
Thank youðŸ˜Š"
