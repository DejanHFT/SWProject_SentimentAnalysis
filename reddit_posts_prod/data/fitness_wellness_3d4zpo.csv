Health and wellness tracking for employees,DavidPHumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3d4zpo/health_and_wellness_tracking_for_employees/,8,3,"Hello,


We are looking at implementing a health and wellness program for our employees. Several of our employees bike and run several miles over their lunch breaks, and we want to figure out a seamless way to track that activity and to encourage more employees to take part. We plan to incentivize this financially, but the technical hiccup is tracking it. Is there any industry standard method of doing so? Smartphone apps? We don't want to track them big brother like, so something employees have to manually trigger when they leave/come back from a workout would be good.


Thanks!

David"
