I (30F) feel absolutely no support from my wife (31F).,throwaway_1589200,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/135tqpu/i_30f_feel_absolutely_no_support_from_my_wife_31f/,27,47,"I don't even know where to begin, but I feel very alone despite being married. My wife is going through a lot--hell, she always is. And I'm always there for her. Trying to do little things to brighten her day, taking on handling the chores so she doesn't have to worry about them, asking her if she's okay, etc. The list goes on. I actually don't even know if she's done the laundry once since we moved into our new place--I'm always the one that ends up doing it. Yet she constantly complains about not having a private washer and dryer (we have a shared one). 

The past few years have been especially tough--we both lost our jobs at the start of covid. She got unemployment. I did not, because I'm a freelancer. So I started doing whatever I could to find work to keep us afloat. Eventually I landed a really awesome job, and I've continuously been employed ever since, slowly making more and more money each year. 

My wife decided to go back to school during covid with my encouragement and a grant that covered most of the expenses. It really was a great way for her to take advantage of passively getting income. She graduated with her certificate within 9 months, and I was so proud of her. She'd start a new career and we could finally start becoming more financially stable. Two years later, she has had 8 jobs, all jobs she finds something wrong with within weeks of starting. Some she held for a mere 4 days, others she held for a few months. Two of them were not her fault for quitting, as we chose to make a huge move to another state, and so she had to leave her job. The other was a contract position that ended. 

After we moved out to the new state, I hit the ground running, thankfully with my job letting me go remote, but taking on extra freelance work to make up the cost of living difference. My wife, depressed that she didn't have a job, spent most days in bed till noon or 1pm. She got a job two months into us being out here, but quit within 4 days, and gave up on her passion she went to school for altogether. She had two more jobs (one with really horrible management), and I felt for her on that. It sucked, but I told her to stick through it because we would not be able to pay our bills if she left. She finally has a really great job, but she complains about it every day and says how much she wants a day off. 

I have been steadily employed this entire time, at points taking on strenuous amounts of freelance work to support us over the years during her periods of unemployment. For reference, last year I made $85,000 and worked about 50-60 hours a week at times. She made $18,000. Not that there's any competition there, but at points I have been so, so tired supporting us. 

She has been having an ongoing battle with her weight, so I made a deal with a gym to do a skills trade to get her and I a personal trainer, because no way could we afford one. She is on a new medication, which unfortunately my insurance doesn't cover, and I told her if she wants to go on it, I will support her. Its about $1000 a month, and I told her we'll be okay, but we can't spend frivolously. She agreed and said she needed it. Her insurance will cover it when she gets her own, so we only have to wait a few more months. In the meantime, she sees friends out on vacations on social media, and she's not even happy for them, she's just jealous and says how she wants a vacation. I understand that's a justified emotion, but she made a a very conscious decision to go on a weight loss medication and said she understood the financial repercussions of that. 

Regarding her entire mood, I've asked her what I can do, that she should consider therapy, anything. She won't budge. She is clearly depressed, and mental illness runs in her family. I have dealt with my own mental health battle, and tell her therapy can really do wonders for her. Her general demeanor is always a poor mood, and I feel emotionally exhausted. I am having a rough go of it lately, and not once does she ever ask how I'm doing, how my day was--she won't touch me, hug me, kiss me, make eye contact with me. I'm always the one to initiate contact. Man, it hurts. She recently said to my brother that she ""doesn't really like any of my friends, and she thinks they don't like her either."" Which shocked me, because in group settings she's such fun. Everyone loves her. 

The breaking point for me was yesterday. We have a friend who is very ill, and has to have surgery to save their life. A friend of mine 6 years ago was in a similar situation and died. This is emotionally wrecking me. She knows this. We had made the decision yesterday to fly out next month, so its weighing heavily on my mind. I had a panic attack while driving us. Thankfully in a parking lot, but I pulled over quickly. As I imploded and struggled to calm myself down, she did nothing to support me. I grabbed her hand to try and help her calm me down, but she gave me two of her fingers. She just sat there in silence while I struggled to gain composure. 

We got home and she spent two hours on her phone, not once asking if I was okay, or if I wanted to talk about it. I tried to cuddle with her, but she never took her hands from her phone--she just ignored me. She did at least tell me to eat, so I got up to make myself an easy meal. 

I feel so alone emotionally, financially, physically. I have talked to her about these issues off and on over the years, but it almost feels like she has a self sabotaging mentality and just doesn't want things to change. I don't know what else to do. I will have to have another talk with her, but I don't know what things will look like on the other side of that. I can't keep making exceptions for her behavior, apologizing to people for her when she's in a bad mood, carrying the both of us financially. This is a pattern of years now, not just a temporary thing. I don't know what to do. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: My wife is emotionally unavailable to me, and I feel emotionally drained dealing with her depression and financially carrying us for nearly 3 years. She refuses to seek help. I don't know what else to do."
