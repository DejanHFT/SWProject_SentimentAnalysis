"If all humans on earth were suddenly moved to an Earth-like planet (same wildlife and natural resources) with no tools or technology, just the knowledge in our collective brains, how long would it take us to rebuild our civilization to reach the same level of technology we have now?",Narcolepzzzzzzzzzzzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/myjsx/if_all_humans_on_earth_were_suddenly_moved_to_an/,45,5,"EDIT:  I posted this here because the discussion involves the process of advancing science, but perhaps since there is no definite answer and it's more of a topic for discussion it belongs in AskReddit instead?

Assuming of course that we actually work to do so instead of just living in primitive anarchy...

The core of my question is really this:  How much of the time spent developing generation after generation of technology that lead to our current state was unavoidable and how much of it was just the time it took for us to figure things out.

For example, even if you already know that you can turn trees into paper, it still takes a long time to manufacture enough paper so that all of society can use and benefit from it.

As a dessert for thought (get it? instead of food? since it's after...hahaaaa ok fine) would the civilization rebuild time change all that much if this hypothetical reboot included a copy of every scientific textbook and paper ever published?  I don't think it would, it would just skip a few years of making paper and everyone writing down everything they know.  Although, some details will surely be remembered by nobodySure, some details won't be remembered by anyone but I don't know.

EDIT:  I meant to describe the planet as basically a ""new"" earth, untouched by humans.  So ""same wildlife and natural resources"" should have been ""same wildlife and natural resources as BEFORE the rise of organized human civilization""."
