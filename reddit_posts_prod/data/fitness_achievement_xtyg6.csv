How to achieve dat ass (and hips... and thighs...)?,scrunchiesmcgee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/xtyg6/how_to_achieve_dat_ass_and_hips_and_thighs/,81,39,"**Female here.** I've lost a bunch of weight just through eating at a deficit and running with the Couch-2-5K program. The problem is that I've lost all my weight in my hips, thighs, and ass (I went from 37"" to 35"" while my waist circumference stayed the same). I tried to run a search and couldn't find much. Can anyone provide some exercises/regimens for me to use (both barbells and machines) so I can get swole down there and widen my hips and ass? I'm on the Starting Strength program, but can I do anything MORE to achieve better results?

I'm freaking out because I used to have a delicious butt and now it's all flabby.. Sigh.
