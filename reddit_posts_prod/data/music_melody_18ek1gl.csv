can you help me find the name of a melody which repeats in various songs?,croqveta,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/18ek1gl/can_you_help_me_find_the_name_of_a_melody_which/,11,6,"hi. some years ago i realised there's a melody that appears in several songs by different artists from different years. i will leave the songs' names and timestamps below.

i looked for it on the internet and found a reddit post which talked about this said melody, and it has a name and a meaning, but i can't seem to find it anywhere now. i know i saw it and would like to share this in case someone can help me...

the songs are the following:

\-led zeppelin - stairway to heaven (you can hear the melody at 6:24)

\-michael jackson - earth song (you hear the melody in every chorus, e.g. 1:27)

\-green day - troubled times (you hear the melody in every chorus, e.g. 0:30)

if anyone knows something about this melody and can give me some information about it.... i would really appreciate it. thanks!

edit - someone commented this is the Dies Irae. it's what i was looking for, in case someone else is interested. :)"
