Is... Jurassic World a critique on modern blockbusters? (spoilers),Cardholderdoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3a48kf/is_jurassic_world_a_critique_on_modern/,21,0,"Ok. So I'm gonna start this out with an opinion that at least doesn't seem popular on this sub.

I hated, *hated* Jurassic World.  I just got back, and I don't think I've been madder in a movie theater since Transformers 2.  A friend and I were talking about it, and the more we talked about it, the more I came to a weird realization about the movie that might save it from... well, being complete and utter garbage.

I think the movie might be a parody of itself, and a criticism of hollywood blockbusters on the whole.

This is a weird thought, but one that might bring this movie up from ""total and complete garbage"" to me, up to the level of ""over-aware hipster bullshit, but at least it has a point"".  To explain...

The movie starts with maybe the longest infodump we've been given in recent memory.  There is just... a lot of information spoon fed to the audience from the early go that takes up at least the first 45 minutes of screentime.  Now throughout that, we're introduced to the heroes, bystanders, and villains of the movie in well... pretty stereotypical fashion.  I could make a drinking game on all the stock tropes and characters they get through, but ultimately what it may be doing is setting the scene for what might be the greatest prank in movie history.  It all starts with one sequence in particular that stands out to me, that has been pointed out several times on this sub- the point where Jake Johnson's character points out the absurdity of corporate sponsorship for dinosaurs.  

The line itself is one of the few gems in the movie where the character talks about ""just letting corporations *name* the dinosaurs, like tostidon"" (paraphrasing).  Its kind of funny, but its the kind of funny that's supposed to be funny to film nerds and almost nothing else.  By itself, its nothing.  But it's presented literally two scenes before a scene where two characters are literally spoon feeding more ""development"" to the audience *in front of a background of product placement* (Bryce Dallas is standing in front of a Mercedes Benz, Pratt is Enjoying a coke in the classic glass bottle, logo visible).

So at this point I think, ""Wow, this is the most unaware movie in the world. How can they make that joke and then basically smash to this scene?  Why would they lampshade it if it's going to turn that quickly.""

Then other things start happening.  Villains give cartoony, mustache twirling speeches.  Tertiary character's flaws are shown to be..  horribly crippling.  Other lampshades to bad movies are shown (of particular note I particularly despised how Pratt outright tells Bryce ""you're not going anywhere in those ridiculous shoes"". Not so much that, its common sense.  What irritated me is she goes the *entire length of the movie still coming out with those shoes looking **fucking pristine** *).  Then, a weird dialog started forming in my head.

What if all this hamhanded lampshading and bad writing was intentional?

Let's start with the most cartoony of villains, D'onofrio's character.  He manages to breeze past every ""military-inspired-captialism-fueled-hippy-hating-warmonger-animal-abuser"" trope we've seen throughout, well, really the last 30 minutes of hollywood.  He has an ulterior motive to use the dinosaurs to what he sees to be the biggest monetary value- in this case (laughably) military applications.  He works in the background to get this done, subverting every stopgap for this type of work by any means necessary.  Most necessary is his alliance with...

BD Wong's character, who reprises his original JP role of Henry Wu.  What's interesting about Wu is how he has apparently changed as a character since the original movie.  In the first, he's at worst an arrogant, slightly aloof character who is an amazing genius who basically fuels the thinktank that made the park possible in the first place.  Sometime over the last twenty years he has clearly gone off the rails with a high end megalomania complex and a disrespect for anyone who really wants to criticize what he's doing... somehow in the face of what happened with the originally Jurassic Park (and the movie makes it clear that the events of the first three movies are absolutely canon).  It's certainly an odd transformation, and one that the viewer would not expect.

Finally, we have Irrfan Khan, who kind of steps in and takes the role of John Hammond.  The movie represents him as kind of an airy, aloof moneyman with naive goals and no idea how to maintain them.  He has people to do that, and *does* want to make a profit, but at the end of the day he also wants to capture the ""wonder"" and ""fun"" that his ""target demographic wants"".  And this is where things get interesting.

During the aforementioned infodump, the movie spends a lot of time describing the environment that causes these three characters to collaborate to create the... *vomits* Indominus Rex.  Audiences are dwindling, people are finding the dinosaurs ""commonplace"".  They wanted to design something ""bigger, better, and with more teeth"", and the walking plot device that is IR is the result of that.

So what does this mean?

I present to you that the three characters above represent the three biggest parties that make the modern movie blockbuster.

Khan represents the directors who have lofty ideals, but little technical experience.  They seek to bring something fun and pure to audiences, but they have to concede to other peoples ideals - stockholders, and in the industry, maybe most importantly...

Producers, whom D'onofrio represents.  These are the cartoony villains of the modern industry.  They have no desire to make something fun or funny or right - they want to exploit new technologies to make the most amount of money they personally can.  They seek to weaponize the creative vision of the director for their own gain.  To that end, they collaborate with...

Wong, who represents modern technical and special effects stuidos.  These studios literally do not care what they are producing, as long as what they are designing is state of the art, new, and gets them notice.

So these three characters get together, and create a big, bad, out of control creation, the Indominus Rex.  Which is the modern blockbuster in it's current state.  It is a huge, unstoppable juggernaut of a force in the industry, and goes out of its way to destroy pieces with artistic merit.  We see this best illustrated by the field full of dead sauropods, relics of the last generation of movies made with less capitalistic intentions.  It's also the source of the creature's (abhorrent) name, Indominous Rex.  It is such a force that it cannot be stopped - not even by those who it would hurt.  In this case, Pratt and Howard represent the modern actors who are mostly caught up in the tide, and have no real power as far as the creative process goes, and ultimately their goals to stop it are pretty much completely fruitless.

What finally *does* in the beast are creatures again, created of a past world of artistic integrity that have iconic value to the ""audience"" - the T-Rex and the Velociraptor.  During the... disgustingly predictable ending these two icons from the past team up to push the Indominous out of their spectrum and ultimately to it's death.

So. Given, I came up with this while being bored watching this pile of garbage, and even if I'm right... it's not doing it much of a favor.  Really, at best, it would upgrade it from ""horribad"" to ""two hours of hipster bullshit"",  but might represent some of the better ""self-aware"" film ever done.

The creators may have *literally* made a bad movie to critique bad movies.  Which is funny...

Just not something I want to sit through.
