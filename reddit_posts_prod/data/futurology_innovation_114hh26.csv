This Sub has Become one of the most Catastrophizing Forums on Reddit,Numerous_Comedian_87,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/114hh26/this_sub_has_become_one_of_the_most/,1750,3113,"I really can't differentiate between this Subreddit and r/Collapse anymore.

I was here with several accounts since a few years ago and this used to be a place for optimistic discussions about new technologies and their implementation - Health Tech, Immortality, Transhumanism and Smart Transportation, Renewables and Innovation.

Now every second post and comment on this sub can be narrowed to ""ChatGPT"" and ""Post-Scarcity Population-Wide Enslavement / Slaughter of the Middle Class"". What the hell happened? Was there an influx of trolls or depraved conspiracists to the forum?"
