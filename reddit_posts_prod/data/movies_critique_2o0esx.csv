Anita Sarkeesian's Manic Pixie Dream Girl Critique,snakyaaron,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2o0esx/anita_sarkeesians_manic_pixie_dream_girl_critique/,10,0,"Before reading the rest of this post please watch the video being referenced: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqJUxqkcnKA&list=PLBBDFEC9F5893C4AF 

So, although I agreed partly with her critique, I strongly objected to the use of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" The idea of the manic pixie dream girl is a woman who enters the depressed male protagonist's life and reinvigorates him. So, at a base level this seems to fit the film. Clem, a wacky girl, enters Joel's life and captures his imagination, providing him with joy and life. However, that's where the conformity stops. Clem isn't a muse-like object, she's a fully fleshed-out character with passions and emotions which often run at odds with Joel's more reserved nature. The film is as much her story as it is Joel's and she in no way serves as his ""muse."" 

At one point in the film she literally outright rejects this stereotype when she says, ""Too many guys think I’m a concept, or I complete them, or I’m gonna make them alive. But I’m just a fucked-up girl who’s looking for my own peace of mind; don’t assign me yours."" For more on this concept I would highly suggest reading this article: http://permanentplastichelmet.com/2011/11/29/characters-i-love-11-kate-winslet-as-clementine-eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind-michel-gondry-2004/

Anyway, I was fascinated by this archetype, but I found it completely inaccurate when she sited Clem as an example as it degraded the complexity of the character immensely. What are your thoughts?
