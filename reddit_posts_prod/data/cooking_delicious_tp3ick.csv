Bacon ends are cheap and delicious. I recommend them.,-ordinary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/tp3ick/bacon_ends_are_cheap_and_delicious_i_recommend/,150,1010,"If you’re not familiar with bacon ends, familiarize yourself. They’re basically the “scraps” that they couldn’t cut into normal sized strips. As such, they’re cheaper. But they’re the exact same quality, and sometimes even more flavorful because they’re from the outer parts of the belly slab (getting more smoke and seasoning). 

The sizes and shapes can be weird, so they’re not always best for just breakfast  strips or whatever, but they’re great for when you’re chopping or crumbling or incorporating into something else. At the same time, most packages have a portion of good sized strips too.

Where I’m from, you can buy Beeler’s bacon ends packaged by the pound at most decent grocers."
