"r/Music, what's your favorite feel-good, uplifting songs?",AnEpicPerson,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/tniqk/rmusic_whats_your_favorite_feelgood_uplifting/,72,30,"So I've been feeling a little down lately for reasons I don't really care to explain. Music has always had a huge impact on how I feel- if I listen to depressing music, I get depressed, if I listen to feel good music, I feel good, etc. So I've been listening to the same. songs. over. and. over. I'm beginning to get tired of them. So, what's your favorite uplifting songs? Any genre is fine, I don't really care, as long as it's light and happy and keeps me moving. Thanks!

EDIT: Thank you all so much! I feel a bit better now. You guys are all good people, except for those who put the most depressing/sad songs ever made in their comment. "
