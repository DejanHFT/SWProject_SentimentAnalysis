Boyfriend not emotionally supportive during abortion,moonchildishh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wmdr9k/boyfriend_not_emotionally_supportive_during/,10,6,"My boyfriend[26M] and I[23F] have been together for 9 months now. Last month we found out that I was 5 weeks pregnant. Moving forward with pregnancy was not anyway an option as we had already talked about our option if we ever happen to land in such a situation. So abortion it was.

I couldn't stop crying since I found out and have been very emotionally distressed about the whole thing. Adding to my distress is that my boyfriend has been acting strange and distant with me from when I had started getting hints of pregnancy. He didn't comfort me one bit or hold my hands or hug me when I went through it. He just sat there and watched me whenever I fell into tears or broke down. He was physically there with me for most of it but never ""actually there with me emotionally"". I had never felt this lonliest in my life. I felt like he didn't really care about me or my feelings anymore. 

I had a conversation with him about this telling him how disappointed I was getting this lack of affection and support from his side. He didn't respond much or even then console me about it, he told me that he was also going through it and was shit scared as to never having experienced anything like this before. Its also not like I chose to abort on my own, he clearly mentioned before it that this was what he wanted too. It made me wonder if I'm at fault for disregarding his feelings or if i'm being selfish.

I feel like this has damaged my relationship with him and I don't know if I would be able to forget this or love him despite everything.

TL;DR - boyfriend not been emotionally supportive during abortion stating he was scared, but the damage is kind of done to the relationship"
