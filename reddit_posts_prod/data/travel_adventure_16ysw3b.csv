Travel in 2024. What this past year has taught us and what you expect for the next adventure,Sane_Lane,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16ysw3b/travel_in_2024_what_this_past_year_has_taught_us/,33,41,"It’s my busy season for work and will spend the winter in Florida planning some adventures for next year. Typically, I’ll begin travel in May expecting the weather to be fair and the peak crowds a few weeks away. Then avoid the summer crowds, and take another trip late September. Current wish list is Euro centric as I’d like to visit Portugal and on another trip do Amsterdam and as a WW2 buff, go see the beaches of Normandy and surrounding areas. 
I’m not a penny pincher or the guy who is ordering the most expensive menu item, I’m in between. Historically, when I go on a trip I usually come home with cash. In 2023, I came home with debt. Of course I paid it off but it taught me that things aren’t cheap anymore. Airfare and accommodations, activities and food are all up across the board. Many of reasons we can all debate as to why. Most popular theory is the post covid demand and all those operators charging us for those years of lost profits. Who knows what 2024 will bring. Which gets me towards budgeting for the next adventure. 
1. The credit card hook. So many credit card operators are offering ridicules perks. These cards usually come with a fee, but could result in a reduced airfare, lounge perks or outright free stays that offset that fee where the balance is in your favor. I would say this is worth it, but is case by case.
2. Airfare? The old buy your ticket on Wednesday at midnight because that’s the cheapest option is a farce. Rates change daily like the stock market. What’s your hack to airfare. Is it still early bird gets the worm?
Or is flexibility the key.
3. Accommodations. All time high and ridiculous. I live in a place where staycations are rejuvenating, not an option anymore. No cheap rates. Not midweek, no off season. This was the part of the most recent trip where I’ll need to refine. When I’m in a city I don’t want to be in the outskirts, I want to wake up in Paris as if I were a resident. But so does everyone else. How can one get ahead to save here. Often I will check rates on a single night and compare if hopping around is worth it, doesn’t seem to be anymore.
4. Food. This is the most variable and least I’m worried about. There’s something for all budgets and a nonnegotiable. Still, I look for deals.
What are you all expecting out of the 2024 travel seasons?"
