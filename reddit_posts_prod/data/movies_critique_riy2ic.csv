what do you think of american beauty?,louistske,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/riy2ic/what_do_you_think_of_american_beauty/,267,363,"I think it's a great movie, a very well done social critique of 90's American families

The actors' acting is amazing in this movie, the cinematography is really good too

The film has a certain melancholy and sad tone especially towards the end with Lester's final monologue. 


I know there are people who criticize the film and  consider an overrated movie but i think it's an amazing movie


It's one of my favorite movies"
