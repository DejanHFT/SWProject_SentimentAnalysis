"Keeping politics and religion out of science is a great idea, so what about keeping science out of politics and religion?",239872437,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1xxlr8/keeping_politics_and_religion_out_of_science_is_a/,12,0,"I know it sounds positively absurd, but think about this. If science cannot sway any opinions in politics or religion, then scientists will have no motive to skew their data to suit their political or religious ends. They will do good, untainted science and only good, untainted science, for the benefit of science. What do you think?"
