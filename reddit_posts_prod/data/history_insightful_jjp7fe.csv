"I’m Thomas Moynihan, a historian, writer, and researcher who studies the history of ideas about human extinction and existential risk.

I’m Thomas Moynihan and I’m currently working with Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute. I completed a PhD at Oriel College on the history of human extinction and am about to publish a book (“[X-Risk: How Humanity Discovered Its Own Extinction](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1913029840)”) that charts how and when our species first became concerned about the fact that it might disappear forever. If that piques your curiosity, check out this expanded timeline from the book that revisits some of the most important milestones in this great, and ongoing, drama of human inquiry: https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/how-humanity-discovered-its-possible-extinction-timeline/.

 
I’m here today to answer any questions you may have about how humans came to contemplate their own extinction. Many of you will instantly be thinking ‘but haven’t humans been prophesying the end of the world since religions began?’, and you’d be right. But, as I contend in the book, the modern idea of human extinction distinguishes itself from the tradition of apocalypse as it is found across cultures and throughout history. Human extinction is a strangely new idea: one that I argue could not exist until a few centuries ago. And, what’s more, I think that our discovery of it is one of humanity’s most important accomplishments…
 

Want to know how our [ideas about aliens](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/world-end-history-cosmos-apocalypse-universe-earth-a9456011.html) have always influenced how we think about our own fate down here? Or how the surprise discovery of dolphin intelligence made us afraid of our own ingenuity and technology? Want to know about the writers who have argued that it is our duty to explode the world (and even the entire universe), or the scientists who boldly suggested that we reorganize not only the whole planet, but also the entire Solar System, so that we can escape that creeping cosmic cold?
 
I’m thrilled to be here (from 12 – 2ish EST) and looking forward to hearing your questions! AMA!
