Personally I think *Master and Commander* is one of the finest historical movie (even if it is based on a fiction novel) I've seen in a long time. There's so many small details that add to the time period, show how ships of the era worked, and set the tone perfectly.

Top it off with incredible cinematography, top notch musical score, and background foley noise that sets the ambiance and mood and we have a great and excellent movie that immerses you in the setting and time.

A close second would be *Patton*, even if it does take a bit of dramatic license with Patton and WW2."
