Hello everyone,
With the New Year fast approaching, like many others I want to get 'fitter' this coming year.
The goal is to strip some body fat and build some lean muscle if this is achievable by running?
I've never been a runner before, but I'd like to get into it - however at the same time would like to build some muscle - all without a gym.
I would like some ideas on how  this can be done and any suggestions on diet / supplements would be welcomed.
Limited to about three times a week as I have recently started martial arts two nights a week.

Thanks in advance,
C
