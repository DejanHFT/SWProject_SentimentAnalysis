Booktuber recommendations?,planoodle,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/195p3q4/booktuber_recommendations/,84,72,"Never thought I’d ask this but I am looking to follow more “booktubers”. I have started following Jack Edwards and up until now he is the only booktuber I have found that reads books that align with my preferences (which is literary fiction that us really discriptive and frankly mostly sad and emotional). When I need a next read, I can almost certainly trust that I am going to love his recommendation. 

So I was looking for more youtubers like him, but every youtuber in my algorithm that I try to watch focuses on YA, fantasy and/or romance. To each their own, but that’s not my thing. 

So do you have any youtubers you think I should check out (or any recommendations in general that might suit other redditers)?

Edit: Wow, thanks for the great response! I have my work cut out for me looking up all these youtubers, but there are some names I have seen pop up a lot of times. Curious to know: have you discovered any new youtubers trough this post?"
