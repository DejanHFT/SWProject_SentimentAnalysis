Could anyone help recommend a product to achieve this finish on a real wood floor? (UK),get_much_higher,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/4c12us/could_anyone_help_recommend_a_product_to_achieve/,13,10,"Hi all! My Dad and I have recently finished putting down a repurposed wood floor from old and new timbers which have been planed to a fairly uniform finish.

We're very conscious of adding a finish that will compliment the grains and finish of the floor - rather than just slapping down any old varnish or preservative.

I have seen this finish in a restaurant recently and really liked the semi-gloss finish and how it brings out the grain and imperfections in the wood. Could anyone recommend what I might use to achieve this? Or any other ideas on how to best achieve a similar, dark, rich finish?

Thanks!"
