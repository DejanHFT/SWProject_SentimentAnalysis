Was the United States founded on Christian values?,dwil6366,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/67lstl/was_the_united_states_founded_on_christian_values/,41,9,I had a history teacher in high school that said each and every founding father was a devout Christian and that their beliefs influenced the founding of the United States. I don't know if that's entirely accurate seeing how the founding fathers wanted to keep church separate from state. Any additional insight fellow history buffs?
