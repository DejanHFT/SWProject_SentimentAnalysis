"Greg Doucette, someone with multiple achievements in bb/pl, says that training for strength is different than hypertrophy and that the rep range differences arent a myth. Thoughts?",Xlaos,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ejcfse/greg_doucette_someone_with_multiple_achievements/,46,9,"You can visit his YT for further info: https://www.youtube.com/user/gregdoucette/videos
 
The point of this post is that he believes that Time Under Tension is the most important factor for building muscle, and the ideal range is around 40-60 seconds (Athlean X also believes this) which usually comes in a rep range of 10-15. He claims that of course you can gain strength without building muscle and he gives multiple examples of powerlifters/weightlifters who arent nearly as muscular as their counterparts in the same weight categories in bodybuilding. E.g. there are 60kg ppl who can lift insane amounts and yet if you saw them outside you wouldnt even be sure that they are going to the gym.

  He argues against a lot of what is currently trending in fitness, like thinking that higher volume trainings are bullshit because they come at the expense of intensity."
