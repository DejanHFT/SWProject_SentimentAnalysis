6 hour layover in Taiwan - explore options?,Usual-Illustrator-56,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15bskdd/6_hour_layover_in_taiwan_explore_options/,4,0,We have a 6.5 hour layover in Taipei next week.  For me thatâ€™s borderline whether to stay at the airport or explore somewhere.   Does anyone who knows the area have suggestions on quick interesting things to check out near the airport?
