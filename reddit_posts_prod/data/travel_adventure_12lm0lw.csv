Anyone here have experience with G Adventures? Particular regarding their “mandatory insurance requirements”?,Material-Otherwise,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/12lm0lw/anyone_here_have_experience_with_g_adventures/,11,0,"I was JUST about to book a trip with them, but I went to the terms and conditions, and I feel so confused by #6, mandatory insurance requirements. This is what is written about to.  $200,000 travel insurance??? I’ve also tried contacting them btw. 

“YOU MUST HAVE TRAVEL INSURANCE WITH A MINIMUM MEDICAL, EVACUATION AND REPATRIATION COVERAGE OF US$200,000 covering all applicable dates of travel with the Tour Operator. This insurance must cover personal injury and emergency medical expenses. On the first day of each Tour, a representative of the Tour Operator will verify that you have sufficient insurance in place. You are strongly recommended to extend your coverage to include cancellation, curtailment, and all other expenses that may arise as a result of loss, damage, injury, delay or inconvenience while traveling. You acknowledge that insurance coverage is not included in the cost of any Tour offered by the Tour Operator and you are required to obtain separate coverage at an additional cost. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have sufficient coverage and comply with the terms of the applicable insurance plans. You are responsible for advising your insurer of the type of travel, destination(s) and activities included in your booking so that the insurer may provide appropriate coverage.”"
