"When you travel internationally, do you prefer to go to as many places as possible, or thoroughly explore a few?",InexperiencedCoconut,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/11pl5xj/when_you_travel_internationally_do_you_prefer_to/,53,28,"In my head, I'd like to see as many countries as possible since I would already be in the vicinity and connecting flights from a hub is much cheaper than flying across the world again a separate time. Like, the ""well I'm already all the way over here"" mindset. But at the same time, I dont want to be rushing my trip and feel like I didn't get to really experience the places. What do you prefer?

For a little insight, I am trying to plan a trip to SE Asia. I want to see Cebu, Bali, and East Java, but I only would have 2 weeks and I feel like I maybe should cut out east java and have more time in the other two."
