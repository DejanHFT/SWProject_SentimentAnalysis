* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_iron_claw_2023) 88% (54 Reviews)

>Powerfully acted and profoundly sad, The Iron Claw honors its fact-based story with a dramatization whose compassionate exploration of family ties is just as hard-hitting as its action in the wrestling ring.

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-iron-claw-review-zac-efron-jeremy-allen-white-1235732693/):

>As a wrenching American heartland saga, The Iron Claw is certainly compelling, and to anyone unfamiliar with the Von Erichs’ history, each jolt of fresh anguish delivered to the family will be startling.

[Deadline] (https://deadline.com/2023/12/the-iron-claw-review-zac-efron-wrestles-with-brotherhood-pain-grief-a24s-relentlessly-sad-true-texas-family-tale-1235663016/):

>This is greek tragedy Texas-style, but it has some significant saving graces in the outstanding performances from a terrific cast Durkin has assembled, led by Efron in a role that may surprise many but this is a fine, often underrated actor.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/the-iron-claw-review-zac-efron-jeremy-allen-white-1235823670/):

>A perfect movie for this moment.

[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/12/12/the-iron-claw-movie-review/71876003007/) (3.5/4):

>The cast is solid down the line, from main stars to supporting players.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-iron-claw-review-1234934419/) (B+):

>I can’t help but feel as if Durkin’s choice to streamline the Von Erich family saga befits the ecstasy of a sport where the line between truth and fiction is body-slammed from the top rope a dozen times every match.

[Collider](https://collider.com/the-iron-claw-movie-review/) (4/5):

>Even if the proceedings sometimes lapse into familiar biopic movie territory, Durkin injects a sense of emotional reality into The Iron Claw that ensures it packs a wallop.

>[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/dec/12/the-iron-claw-review-zac-efron) (3/5):

>The Von Erichs endured so much loss, and Durkin manages to convey some of it.

[AV Club](https://www.avclub.com/the-iron-claw-movie-review-zac-efron-1851041218) (B-):

>Durkin’s gift is as a stylist, with his camera soaking in the grief-stricken atmosphere until it’s dripping with dread.

[Slant Magazine](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/the-iron-claw-review-zac-efron-sean-durkin/) (3/4):

>With scalpel-like precision, the film exposes the agonies of fathers, sons, and brothers.

[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20231212-the-iron-claw-review-wrestling-drama-is-shallow-and-bland) (2/5):

>Who are these characters? Durkin seems to take for granted that they're as fascinating to us as they are to him, instead of engaging us in his long-simmering enthusiasm.

[The Daily Beast] (https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/the-iron-claw-review-zac-efrons-muscles-dont-save-wrestling-drama?ref=author) (Skip This):

>Blame for this sports drama’s shallow leadenness can’t be similarly pinned on the supernatural; instead, its shortcomings are attributable to a one-dimensional script and resultant performances that are far less nuanced than its headliners’ ripped bodies.
