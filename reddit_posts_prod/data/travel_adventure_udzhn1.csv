4 Day Adventure itinerary for Puerto Rico,Travellers0001,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/udzhn1/4_day_adventure_itinerary_for_puerto_rico/,1,2," Hi all! Hope everyone is doing wonderful! I need some insights and expert advice for my Puerto Rico trip during the memorial day May 31 long weekend. We will be traveling to San Juan for 4 days and it's 4 of us. We are looking for more of an adventure trip on a budget than a relaxing trip.   


My initial plan is   
Day 1: Head to Vieques, Check in to the hotel, Sightseeing, hiking, Bio Bay  
Day 2: Check out, Vieques beach, scuba and head to Culebra, Snorkel at Playa Flamenco, and check in to the hotel  
Day 3: Check out, Head to Main Island, El Yunke, Fajardo check in hotel  
Day 4: Check out and explore San Juan (old) and head to the airport late at night.   


This is our rough plan. I would more than appreciate some insights into what's feasible and/or recommendations.   


Also, how is the rental car situation (do we need cars on islands too?), Are there lockers on beech to put valuables in or showers?."
