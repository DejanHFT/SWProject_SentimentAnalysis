Exploration style adventure holiday,4ippaJ,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/f69uqd/exploration_style_adventure_holiday/,20,3,"Hi r/Travel! So I just finished playing Breath of the Wild and I've been fantasising about a holiday where I choose a location and just start walking (well prepared) and exploring on my own without much previous knowledge of what I might find. Would really appreciate some advice!

Firstly - I'm not quite sure where would be best for something like this, I know that only some countries have freedom-to-roam laws so that's an important factor. Ideally I'd love to go somewhere that is secluded but relatively safe and has an interesting mix of terrain and small villages. Currently I'm leaning towards the UK, Switzerland or perhaps Norway? 

Secondly - Has anyone ever had a holiday like this before? Was it a success? Is there anything I should be aware of when planning?  

Thanks for your time :)"
