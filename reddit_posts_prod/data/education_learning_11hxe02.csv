I volunteer with an organisation mentoring kids in schools. We run activities to teach and practice soft skills for the kids {communication, confidence, critical thinking, public speaking, leadership, etc}.

I was wondering if any of you (the honest to god experts and heroes of this) had any activities you do with your class that are either fun, help with a soft skill, or are generally a success with your students.

Thank you!"
