My mind was blown after reading this article.  Can someone tell me about your fascination with cellular automata?,berlinbrown,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/evwom/my_mind_was_blown_after_reading_this_article_can/,23,14,"I was off this last week and decided to refresh my AI knowledge. I was looking for information on autonomous agents and stumbled upon cellular automata. I researched the topic in the past but not much in detail.

For the past week, I really got into it and my mind is completely blown. Basically, cellular automata consists of applying simple rules (programs as Stephen Wolfram calls them) to a on/off cell grid. You start with some initial state and then run the program.  Over time, patterns start to emerge.

In one speech, Stephen Wolfram claims to have modeled space and time with some of his experiments. It is fascinating stuff.

Also, I want to write some applications with real world examples. Could you also help me build some practical? Right now, I was thinking of building a visual turing machine demo.
