Best website/app for exploring new cities?,connorisverycool,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15aj12l/best_websiteapp_for_exploring_new_cities/,1,1,"I currently research every city I travel to by looking for the primary tourist attractions/highlights and then pin the locations in one of my ‘guides’ using Apple Maps so that I can use the map when I’m there.

Is there any other platform that has already done a good job of this?

Thanks!"
