"Kierkegaard’s “The Lilies and the Birds,” Discourse I: “To Be Contented with Being a Human Being”",ConclusivePostscript,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/5ucohl/kierkegaards_the_lilies_and_the_birds_discourse_i/,10,18,"After an unconscionably long hiatus—for which I beg my readers’ pardon—we can finally pick up [where we left off](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/521crw/kierkegaards_upbuilding_discourses_in_various/) in Kierkegaard’s *Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits*. The first discourse of Part Two is entitled, “To Be Contented with Being a Human Being.” Its chief theme is that of comparison (as Patrick Sheil rightly notes in *Starting with Kierkegaard*, pp. 32-37).

Kierkegaard opens the discourse by quoting [Matthew 6:24-34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A24-34&version=NRSV) in full, which sets the theme and tone not only for this discourse but the two that follow it. As the title of Part Two suggests, the verses of central importance are 26-30: “Look at the birds of the air; they sow not and reap not and gather not into barns, and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more than they? But who among you can add one foot to his growth even though he worries about it? And why do you worry about clothing? Look at the lilies in the field, how they grow; they do not work, do not spin. But I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed as one of these. If, then, God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is and tomorrow is cast into the stove, would he not much more clothe you, of little faith?” (pp. 159-60).

The discourse makes clear its culturally Christian audience right off the bat: “Who has not known this Holy Gospel from earliest childhood and often rejoiced in the joyful message!” But this is not “simply a joyful message” for the materially content but spiritually complacent churchgoer. It is “spoken not to the healthy, not to the strong, not to the happy, but to the worried,” and it “has solicitude for them—in the right way.” What is the right way? Well, not that of the happy, the strong, or even the worried themselves: “The happy person does not understand him, the strong person seems to rise above him just when comforting him, and the worried person only increases the cares for him by his contribution.” For this reason, “it is best to look around for other teachers whose words are not a misapprehension, whose encouragement does not contain any hidden blame, whose glance does not judge, whose comfort does not agitate instead of calm.” This is why, asserts the discourse, the Gospel refers us to “the lilies in the field and the birds of the air,” for “these inexpensive teachers … one pays neither with money nor with humiliation” and with them “no misapprehension is possible, because they are silent…” (p. 160).

What is the importance of the lilies’ and birds’ silence? Silence “respects the worry and respects the worried one as Job’s friends did, who out of respect sat silent with the sufferer and held him in respect [see Job 2:11-13]. And yet they did look at him! But that one person looks at another implies in turn a comparison. The silent friends did not compare Job with themselves—this did not happen until their respect (in which they silently held him) ceased and they broke the silence in order to attack the sufferer with speeches, but their presence prompted Job to compare himself with himself. No individual can be present, even though in silence, in such a way that his presence means nothing at all by way of comparison.” The lily, on the other hand, “does not compare its prosperity with anyone’s poverty,” and the bird “does not compare its buoyant flight with the heavy steps of the worried person;” instead, “there is unbroken silence; no one is present there, and everything is sheer persuasion” (p. 161).

“Yet this is so,” the discourse adds, “only if the person in distress actually gives his attention to the lilies and the birds and their life and forgets himself in contemplation of them and their life, while in his absorption in them he, unnoticed, by himself learns something about himself”—for the lily and the bird, in their objective silence, are not enough for the discourse to proceed. There must also be a subjective attention and appropriation on the part of the worried, the anxious one. When this attention is given, he “is free of any and all co-knowledge, except God’s, his own—and the lilies’” (pp. 161-2).

Whereupon Kierkegaard gives the theme of the discourse in bold, urging us to “consider how by properly looking at the lilies in the field and at the birds of the air the worried person learns: **to be contented with being a human being**.” (Once again we see how far Kierkegaard is from the prevalent caricatures of existentialists as broody dudes with angsty moods and ’tudes.) So we observe, first, the lilies, as the discourse provides the worrying one with yet another edifying thought to justify this attentiveness: “Alas, [the worried person], too, is like the abandoned lily—abandoned, unappreciated, disregarded, without human solicitude…” (p. 162). Moreover, it is not as with the rare plants for which a rich gardener might care, where we observe more directly the reason behind the plants’ growth. The “common lilies, the lilies in the field,” do not permit this observational shortcut—for “how can they grow out there? And yet they do grow” (p. 163).

The question is rhetorical, of course. A scientific answer would utterly miss the point. The point is that the lilies are not like “the rare flowers,” which “require so much work to get them to grow,” and yet out in the field, “where the carpet is richer than in the halls of kings, there is no work” (p. 163). Yet the discourse is not afraid of employing, albeit lightly, a bit of science to further its lyrical movements; it smiles at the fact that a microscope, in all its genius, reveals “that even the finest human work is coarse and imperfect,” and yet through the same glass the lily becomes “more and more ingenious.” What’s more, “the discovery [of the lily’s minute detail, its profound artistry] honor[s] God, as every discovery is bound to do, because it holds true only of a human artist that the one who knows him intimately, close up and in ordinary life, sees that he is not so great after all; [but] of the artist who weaves the carpet of the field and produces the beauty of lilies, it holds true that the wonder increases the closer one comes, that the distance of adoration and worship increase the closer one comes to him” (p. 164).

Here the discourse stops again, and reflects again on the maieutic situation of the worried one and the lily. It is precisely because the lily *cannot speak*, and does not provoke comparison by force of *words or conscious presence*, that the worried one is permitted, *in freedom*, to draw an analogy between the glorious contented simplicity of the lily and his or her own situation. For it is possible for any human being to experience the glorious contented simplicity of being human by casting off the Solomonic glories and “meritoriousness” by which he or she is artificially adorned (p. 165).

Here Kierkegaard, as he is [wont to do](https://www.amazon.com/Parables-Kierkegaard-Kierkegaards-Writings-Paperback/dp/0691020531), gives us a parable—in this instance, the parable of *the worried lily*. This lily “stood in an isolated spot beside a small brook and was well known to some nettles and also to a few other small flowers nearby.” It was remarkably beautiful and “joyful and free of care all the day long.” One day a bird visited the lily, and the next day, and a few days later. Its capriciousness, its not staying in the same place, the lily found strangely endearing. Indeed, “the lily fell more and more in love with the bird precisely because it was capricious.” But the bird was a mischievous one. It showed off its freedom of flight, and chattered on about the lilies in other places where “there were entirely different gorgeous lilies in great abundance,” places of “rapture and merriment, a fragrance, a brilliance of colors,” and “a singing of birds” that was “beyond all description.” The bird made the lily feel more and more insignificant, “so insignificant that it was a question whether the lily actually had a right to be called a lily” (p. 167).

The bird added cares upon cares to the previously content lily. It “told it that of all the lilies the Crown Imperial was regarded as the most beautiful and was the envy of all other lilies.” The lily worried more and more about its relative inferiority, though contented itself that it was “not asking for the impossible, to become what I am not, a bird, for example. My wish is only to become a gorgeous lily, or even the most gorgeous” (p. 168). So the bird agreed to remove the lily from its soil and “fly with the lily to the place where the gorgeous lilies blossomed” and “help the lily to be planted down there” so that it “might succeed in becoming a gorgeous lily in the company of all the others, or perhaps even a Crown Imperial, envied by all the others” (pp. 168-9). But no, the parable ends tragically, albeit with humorous abruptness: “Alas, on the way the lily withered” (p. 169). (RIP, poor lily.)

Then, perhaps after the pattern of Jesus explaining one of his parables to his closest disciples (see Mk. 4:34; cf. Mt. 13:18-23 // Mk. 4:13-20 // Lk. 8:11-15; also Mt. 13:36-43), Kierkegaard happily clarifies his parable of the worried lily: “The lily is the human being. The naughty little bird is the restless mentality of comparison… The little bird is the poet, the seducer, or the poetic and the seductive in the human being. The poetic is like the bird’s talk, true and untrue, fiction and truth. It is indeed true that there is diversity [of status, etc.] and that there is much to be said about it, but the poetic consists in maintaining [the view] that diversity, impassioned in despair or jubilation, is the supreme, and this is eternally false. In the worry of comparison, the worried person finally goes so far that because of diversity he forgets that he is a human being, in despair regards himself as so different from other people that he even regards himself as different from what it is to be human…” (p. 169). The despair Kierkegaard refers to here is probably the despair of weakness (on which see 2a and 2b of [my earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/2jr82s/twin_peaks_and_kierkegaard_the_nature_and/) on the nature and varieties of despair with continual reference to *Twin Peaks*). But one could easily spin other versions of this parable (as Johannes de Silentio does with the story of Abraham and Isaac at the beginning of *Fear and Trembling*) in which the worried lily is more complicit, is guilty of a more “defiant” despair.

Of course this is ultimately but a parable, and so Kierkegaard steals it back from us (similar to Johannes Climacus’s move at the end of *Concluding Unscientific Postscript*). For “how do I dare in earnest to accuse the divinely appointed teachers… No, the lily is not worried this way, and this is why we should learn from it.” From the lilies, the worried person “learns to be contented with being a human being and not to be worried about diversity among human beings…” (p. 170).

Before turning to the second part of this discourse, Kierkegaard makes a careful distinction. He remarks that all “*worldly* worry has its basis in a person’s unwillingness to be contented with being a human being, in his worried craving for distinction by way of comparison. One does not, however, dare to say directly and summarily that *earthly* and *temporal* worry is an invention of comparison, because in actual straitened circumstances a person does not discover his need for food and clothing by way of comparison…” With this distinction Kierkegaard makes room for legitimate concerns about earthly life; not all finite worries are “worldly.” Still, he also suggests that the shrewdness of comparison can “equivocally play a part in the definition of what is to be understood by worry over making a living…” (p. 171). (The comparative attitude often uses legitimate worries to justify inordinate ones.)

On that note, he turns our attention from the lilies to the birds, so that we may consider “*how the one whom worry about making a living causes distress learns to be contented with being a human being by properly paying attention to the birds of the air*” (p. 171). Here numerous themes are repeated from the discourse’s discussion of the lilies, which we need not belabor, but several novel themes are also welcomed in. In particular, Kierkegaard observes the lines from the Gospels that the birds “*sow not and reap not and gather not into barns*,” and uses this to introduce the concept of temporality (picking up what was implicit in the distinction just touched upon at the end of the last section). For the birds of the air live “without temporality’s foresight, unaware of time,” whereas the “person of foresight on earth learns from time to use time, and when he has his barn full from a *past* time and is provided for in the *present* time, he still takes care to sow seed for a future harvest so that in turn he can have his barn full for a *future* time” (p. 172; cf. the relation of time and anxiety as thematized in Kierkegaard’s *The Concept of Anxiety*).

The discourse eventually constructs for us another parable, this time one about a “wood-dove” with “its nest in the scowling forest,” and “some of its distant relatives, some tame doves,” living near the house of a farmer (p. 174). Conversation with the tame doves convinces the wood-dove “that it must be very pleasant to *know* that one’s living was secured for a long time,” and “miserable to live continually in uncertainty so that one never dares to say that one *knows* one is provided for.” Whereupon it resolves to hoard a stockpile for itself, waking early and working more busily in order to do so. “Meanwhile there was no essential change about making a living. Every day it found its food just as before, and if it helped itself to a bit less, that was because it wanted to collect and because it did not take time to eat—otherwise it was richly supplied as before. Yet, alas, it had undergone a big change; it was far from suffering actual need, but it had acquired an *idea* of need in the future. It had lost its peace of mind—it had acquired *worry about making a living*.” Consequently, its “feathers lost their iridescence; its flight lost its buoyancy,” and it “was no longer joyful” (p. 175). “It had trapped itself in a snare in which no fowler could trap it, in which only the free can trap himself: in the idea” (pp. 175-6). Like the lily, the wood-dove makes excuses for its worry, noting that it is not asking “for something impossible,” i.e., “not asking to become like the wealthy farmer but merely like one of the wealthy doves” (p. 176).

As before, Kierkegaard explains his parable, this time with emphasis on “making a living.” The parable of the wood-dove teaches the worried one “to be contented with being a human being, with being the humble one, the created being who can no more support himself than create himself.” This is not to deny that there is a place for a healthy sort of prudence and ambition: “It is certainly praiseworthy and pleasing to God that a person sows and reaps and gathers into barns, that he works in order to obtain food; but if he wants to forget God and thinks he supports himself by his labors, then he has worry about making a living.” This is true, he notes, even for the wealthiest man alive (p. 177). This can be read not just as an attack on worldly ambition and greed for material things—Kierkegaard’s direct target in this part of the discourse—but as a general critique of the deification of autonomy. The one who is not content with being human demands “to be himself his own providence for all his life or perhaps merely for tomorrow;” he “wants to entrench himself, so to speak, in a little or large area where he will not be the object of God’s providence,” and “may not perceive, before it is too late, that in this entrenched security he is living—in a prison,” indeed has “trapped himself unto death” (p. 178; cf. *The Sickness Unto Death*).

Even so, the main object of Kierkegaard’s critique remains constant in both parts of this discourse. It is the comparative attitude and not some natural care that generates this all-consuming worry: “worry about making a living is produced by comparison, insofar as the worry about making a living is not the actual pressing need of the day today but is the idea of a future need” (p. 178); it “does not manifest the actual need but the imagined need.” And while the discourse never claims that this comparative mentality is the root of all anxiety and despair and sin, it does suggest that “comparison is perhaps one of the most corrupting kinds of defilement” (p. 179).

As the discourse draws to a close, it ends on a note of equality: both poor and wealthy may have this anxiety about making a living, and in that sense the Gospel does not take sides (pp. 180-81). Nevertheless, there is a hint of special criticism aimed at the wealthy: “What human being can legitimately and truthfully say these words, ‘I have no worry about making a living’? If the rich person points to his wealth as he says it, I wonder if there is a trace of sense in his words! … Would it not be a scandalous contradiction for someone who owned a costly collection of excellent medicines that he used every day to say as he pointed at the medicines: I am not sick!” And so Kierkegaard concludes: “To be dependent on one’s treasure—that is dependence and hard and heavy slavery; to be dependent on God, completely dependent—that is independence” (p. 181). For: “Dependence on God is the only independence, because God has no gravity [cf. Nietzsche’s notion of “killing the spirit of gravity” in *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*]; only the things of this earth, especially earthly treasure, have that—therefore the person who is completely dependent on him is light” (p. 182).
