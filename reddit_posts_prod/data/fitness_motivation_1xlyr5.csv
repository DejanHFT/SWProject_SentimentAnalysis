What is your motivation?,tcole6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1xlyr5/what_is_your_motivation/,984,570,"I am having trouble finding motivation for my fitness. I used to be in great shape, but now I am married, work full time, and perform comedy several times a week, leaving me a lot less fit than just a year ago. I feel a bit helpless and need some inspiration. 

So Redditors, what is your motivation to be fit?"
