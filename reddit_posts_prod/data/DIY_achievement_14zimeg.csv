Trying to figure out a mechanism for a jump scare,Pissfleck,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/14zimeg/trying_to_figure_out_a_mechanism_for_a_jump_scare/,5,0,"I've been contemplating building a jump scare (e.g. for Halloween) where someone tries to grab a treat from a hole in a table. All decoration aside, I envision it as a simple table frame with a bucket underneath, but I want to add some kind of peddle-driven mechanism that can clamp a pair of hands together. This would then grab the arm of the person trying to grab the treat. I'm fairly confident I can get most of this built pretty easily, but I'm struggling to come up with the actual mechanism that connects the hands and the paddle. Preferably it would also spring back once the peddle is released. Does anyone have any ideas on how something like this could be achieved?
