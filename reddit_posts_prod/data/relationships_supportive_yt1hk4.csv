"Me [35F] coping badly with unemployment, husband (40m) trying to be supportive but failing. How can I overcome my depression and help him be supportive of me?",MoiJaimeLesCrepes,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/yt1hk4/me_35f_coping_badly_with_unemployment_husband_40m/,8,1,"I work in tech and I lost my job. It wasn't just me that was let go, but all of my teams. I was the manager, so I had to deliver the news to everybody. brutal.   


I'd like to say I'm coping ok, but I really am not. it feels like a part of my life is gone. am grieving. it hurts.

I've been interviewing for a new job of course, but so far all I failed one interview. 

Of course, I felt bad about the layoff. But now I feel doubly bad that I didn't get the next job. I didn't boil down to my performance, they said, but ""to the right fit"", which seems reasonable and believable.

I appreciate intellectually that none of that is my fault, but my heart is heavy with self-blame, sadness, and anxiety. The pain is bad. I cry a lot. My mood is unstable. I don't sleep well. I dream of the events that have happened, I relive things. I've lost weight already. I can't eat. 

I do receive care for depression and anxiety, and I am aware that it's gotten worse, and that I am dealing with it badly. I just don't know what to do about it, concretely, except for finding a new job!  


Yesterday my spouse told me to just buckle down and do more than what I am doing (which is, brushing up on tech skills, applying for jobs, going to interviews - but he means in terms of working out, taking care of housekeeping, doing hobbies, doing chores about the land, having fun and being fun). He tells me he was expecting me to be more functional than this, and that I had coped with worse professional setbacks when I was younger (which is true, although things were very different). He says that only by doing activities will I get better. When he said all that, I just broke down crying. I said I just couldn't do that, that it's not just a matter of willing myself to stop moping. I cried a lot. He then apologized saying he just thought a kick in the shin would help me, and that in the past this has worked. 

I have friends and they help me with things like practicing coding, or just with being entertained, but they're not able to help on the emotional front. I see them and talk to them all the same since their company is soothing. But then when they are gone I am back to the sadness.   


Spouse is gone for a while to visit his family. I refused to go because I just can't deal with them right now. I had just received another bout of bad news (hiring freeze at a company that could have been a fit, heard from a colleague through the grapevine), and this made me cry even more.  spouse just said ""I will be back soon. the house and pets will keep you company. just do fun things and stay busy. love you."" Am all alone now, and it's been rough.

I understand he's trying to help, and that he doesn't like to see me like this. He's been unemployed for many months in the past, so he knows just how hard it is. I don't know what to tell him about what he should do to help me, since I don't know what to do with myself, even.   


  \*\*tl;dr\*\*: I lost my job and part of my identity went out of the window with it. Am coping badly with depression. Husband is trying to be supportive, but is very clumsy at it (he's asking me to snap out of it). Not sure what to do with myself, or what to tell husband so he can be of effective support."
