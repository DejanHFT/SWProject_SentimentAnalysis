Do you need a return ticket to explore Europe,Smart-Bag-6270,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/11sfj12/do_you_need_a_return_ticket_to_explore_europe/,7,0,"Hi, I'm an American who has a trip scheduled to Europe. I have a flight from USA to Iceland, I'll be spending 2 days there then onward to Stockholm Sweden. My plan was to explore Europe from there, traveling south to Denmark, Germany, etc... but I'm not exactly when I'll be leaving Europe. I know I can't stay more than 90 days visa-free, so obviously not more than that, probably only 3 or 4 weeks. Will I be allowed entry into Sweden without a return ticket scheduled? I'm also planning on staying in hostels most of the time, so my lodging also will not be scheduled too far in advance. I have more than enough money to cover these expenses."
