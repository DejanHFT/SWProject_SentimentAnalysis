Historical accuracy of HBO's Chernobyl?,Antigonus96,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/chomf4/historical_accuracy_of_hbos_chernobyl/,54,27,"I recently finished watching the miniseries Chernobyl on HBO, and from a dramatic/story telling perspective it was fantastic. I am rather curious about its historical accuracy though, I know the writers took some liberties, for example, making up the character Uliana as a composite of several different real life people, and obviously the exact lines of dialogue spoken in private must have been created for the show. However, how accurate was their overall depiction of the accident itself and the broad timeline of events surrounding it?"
