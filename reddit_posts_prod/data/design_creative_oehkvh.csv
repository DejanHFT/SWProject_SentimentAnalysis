"I feel like I am losing my creativity the older that I get, how do I prevent this from continuing?",cabbage-soup,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/oehkvh/i_feel_like_i_am_losing_my_creativity_the_older/,39,105,"I am currently 20 years old in college for design. I look back on my sketchbook from 4-5 years ago and I feel like my art was significantly better back then. I used to be able to illustrate these wild ideas and had sketchbooks full of fantasy characters. I show the art to my friends and they barely believe it’s mine. I can’t produce nearly the same quality of creativity anymore. 

Now, I try to sit down to draw and my mind is blank. Most of my sketches are usually the same abstract faces because I just can’t think of anything different. I miss the creativity I had as a kid. How do I go back to that?

Edit: I should clarify that I am in a design program at a private liberal arts college. I only actually take 3 design courses and like 4 fine arts courses. A lot of my curriculum is random liberal arts core. I see some design school students/graduates who are commenting, but just keep in mind that my school experience is probably a lot different than a dedicated design school."
