AskScience AMA Series: We're Event Horizon Horizon Telescope members who captured the first black hole image. Ask Us Anything!,AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/olel36/askscience_ama_series_were_event_horizon_horizon/,263,2339,"Two years ago, we captured the first image of a Black Hole. Ask Us Anything! We'll be answering questions from 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM Eastern Time!

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) - a planet-scale array of eleven ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration - was designed to capture images of a black hole. Two years ago, EHT researchers successfully unveiled the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow. The EHT recently released a new version of the historic image, now shown in polarized light.

As we continue to delve into data from past observations and pave the way for the next-generation EHT, we wanted to answer some of your questions! You might ask us about:

+ Observing with a global telescope array
+ Black hole theory and simulations
+ The black hole imaging process
+ Technology and engineering in astronomy
+ Recent and upcoming results
+ International collaboration at the EHT
+ The next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT)

Our Panel Members consist of:

+ Richard Anantua, Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian
+ Nicholas Conroy, Outreach and Science Technician at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian
+ Sheperd Doeleman, Founding Director of the Event Horizon Telescope and Astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian
+ Charles Gammie, Donald Biggar Willett Professor of Physics and Professor of Astronomy at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
