"Can you actually make truly delicious food without salt and butter? If so, what?",Aequitas123,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1874ork/can_you_actually_make_truly_delicious_food/,236,91,"Trying to eat healthier, specifically reducing sodium, but also sticking closer to a Mediterranean diet.
