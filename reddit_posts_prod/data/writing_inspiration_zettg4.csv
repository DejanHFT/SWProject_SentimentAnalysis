"Why does writing have to be so hard, and coming up with an idea is easier but you lose motivation and inspiration quickly?",Charrise,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/zettg4/why_does_writing_have_to_be_so_hard_and_coming_up/,34,3,"Hi, I have a question I lose motivation in writing easily but keep getting ideas, It’s not as fun as imagining the idea But I want to write, does writing always have to be hard and not enjoyable? Or does it mean you haven’t found the write process yet? Like writing can be fun when you find your process? Is writing supposed to be hard all the time is it supposed to be hard and not fun after a while? And then you get excited again?  Is there anything I can do to live the writing process and make it fun for me?"
