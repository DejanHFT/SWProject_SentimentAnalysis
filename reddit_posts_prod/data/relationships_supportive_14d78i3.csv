"Confused and forlorn. Am I [F34] being supportive, or just adjusting to him [M42] breadcrumbing me?",OkKaleidoscope1067,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14d78i3/confused_and_forlorn_am_i_f34_being_supportive_or/,3,8,"

I'm F34 dating M42. We're both divorced single parents, my boys 9 and 6, his little girl is 6. I have primary custody of mine, unlike him. We first started talking last Christmas and dating exclusively since Feb '23. After our first trip together, we both decided we wanted a committed relationship. Things picked up quickly as we got along great and seemed aligned in many areas of our lives.  He travels often for his cybersecurity work, and his trips tend to be impromptu. 

I don't know much about cybersecurity work, but there have been times when he traveled and would not call or answer calls for days on end. I have spoken to him about how I communicating helps me feel connected, but I there have been more incidents, even times when he was in town.

Sadly, he lost his mom in March following a brief illness and his dad too only a month after. I really think the man died of a brokenheart. They were both in their 80s and had been together all of their lives. 

These events rocked my BF's world. It broke my heart to watch him deal with grief, especially with his particularly stoic nature. I wanted to do my best to support him through it and even though I wasn't sure exactly how, I just remained the friend and partner I knew I would I wanted when I lost my own dad. 


Now, more often than ever, he 'forgets' things we planned to do or just goes off the grid for days. I have shown grace and patience with him because I understand this could be his grief showing up. When we speak, I tell him how a simple text to let me know he couldn't speak would suffice. But I'm seeing the pattern get worse. As a rule of thumb, I never call multiple times. I call once and send a text message. 

I want to continue to support him and give grace as he moves through this season, but I find myself struggling with anxiety from knowing he was this way even before his loss. The longer I go without being able to reach him, the more I think I could be setting myself up for normalizing mistreatment. This is very difficult for me to navigate, and I do not ever want to seem inconsiderate or insensitive. I start to overthink and wonder why I haven't met any of his friends or family. In April, I told him I would like him to meet my kids. He seemed excited, too. I have, however, held off on that plan amidst all these recent events. 

Last week, he had his daughter come visit from out of state and only texted me a few times during the week. I followed his lead during the work week and wanted to show respect for his time with his daughter.  I called him on Friday night but he didn't answer. I saw that he had viewed my instagram stories and called once again yesterday, but there was no response. I sent him a Father's Day text today and asked him to call me when he could. He called back this afternoon, and I told him frankly that I didn't appreciate being ignored. He mumbled something about his phone breaking and being busy with his daughter. I have heard her in the background and seen her photos, but I've never met or spoken to her. I have never asked either, because I think that should be his call. 

We both started out wanting a committed relationship, but I know that people sometimes change their minds. It makes me sad to think that he might have changed his mind and just does not know how to tell me.  I'm starting to make peace with knowing that this might not work out, but I don't want to jump the gun.When my friends and family ask about him, I change the subject, because I'm ashamed to admit that it might be a lost cause.

I would really like this to work, but I can't do it on my own, and it's hard to know where his head is, especially as he remains so closed off. I love him, but I'm starting to think I've been making room for someone who does not make room for me. I have my kids 95% of the time with a full-time job and house to take care of with no help from anyone at all.  His nonchalance really makes me feel resentful for always making time for him, and I don't want to waste my time overextending myself.

I want to build a healthy relationship with an emotionally available partner who shows up for me like I show up for him, but I feel more alone than ever. Life is way more stressful now that I'm in a relationship because I'm still juggling my very full life while prioritizing someone who doesn't seem to want to do the same for me. 

All our conversations have not resulted in changed behavior. Is it worth holding on, or should I call things off?

TL;DR 
Should I keep holding on to my avoidant nonchalant boyfriend?"
