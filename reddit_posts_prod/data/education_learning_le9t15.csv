Are learning styles a myth?,byvs2013,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/le9t15/are_learning_styles_a_myth/,97,132,"Hi! It has just now come to my attention that new studies are showing adjusting lessons to match the learning styles of the learners does not necessarily produce better results. All of the previous research on learning styles was not focused on the end result. Thus, learning styles are a myth. 

I'm dumbfounded. So many educators and professors speak about planning lessons that appeal to various learning styles. 

Can someone point me to these studies? All I can personally find are articles explaining how many teachers belief this ""myth""."
