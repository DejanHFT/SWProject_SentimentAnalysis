Could use a little motivation,StingRaie13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4a2en5/could_use_a_little_motivation/,25,17,"Basically, for the last two weeks, I've been really cracking down on losing weight because I've been putting off getting healthier for a while now, and it's so hard to stay motivated. I've been counting calories and working out 3+ times a week and I bought a scale today (against my mom's advice), and weighed in at 160, 8 lbs more than where I started. (5'4"" F). Could be the time of day plus food and normal weight fluctuation, but right now I'm feeling really unmotivated and I don't want to give up, but I just don't know how to proceed. Any advice?"
