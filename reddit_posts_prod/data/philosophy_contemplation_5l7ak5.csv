Ernest Becker's existential Nihilism,windthatshakesbarley,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/5l7ak5/ernest_beckers_existential_nihilism/,289,1119,"[For those of you not familiar](http://academyofideas.com/2016/09/the-denial-of-death-ernest-becker/)

To start, I must say that *The Denial of Death* truly is a chilling book. I've read philosophy and psychology my entire life, through grad school, but never have I had so much of my world ripped to shreds by reading a single book. A scary rabbit hole to go down, so buyer beware.

**Becker argues that all of human character is a ""vital lie"" we tell ourselves, intended to make us feel secure in the face of the horror of our own deaths.** 

Becker argues that to contemplate death free of neurosis would fill one with paralyzing anxiety, and nearly infinite terror. 

Unlike traditional psychologists and philosophers however, Becker argues that neuroses extend to basically everything we value, and care about in the world. Your political belief system, for example, is merely a transference object. Same goes for your significant other. Or your dog. Or your morality.

**These things keep you tethered, in desperate, trembling submission, seeing yourself through the eyes of your mythology, in a world where the only reality is death. You are food for worms, and must seek submission to some sense of imagined meaning... *not* as a higher calling, but in what amounts to a cowardly denial in a subconscious attempt to avoid facing the sheer terror of your fate.**

He goes on to detail how by using this understanding, we can describe all sorts of mental illnesses, like schizophrenia or depression, as failures of ""heroism"" (Becker's hero, unlike Camus', is merely a repressed and fearful animal who has achieved transference, for now, and lives within his hero-framework, a successful lawyer, or politician - say - none the wiser.)

At the extremes, the schizophrenic seeks transference in pure ideation, feeling their body to be alien... and the psychotically depressed, in elimination of the will, and a regression back into a dull physical world. 

He believes the only way out of this problem is a religious solution (being that material or personal transferences decay by default - try holding on to the myth of your lover, or parents and see how long that lasts before you start to see cracks), but he doesn't endorse it, merely explains Kierkegaard's reason for his leap.

He doesn't provide a solution, after all, what solution could there be?  He concludes by saying that a life with some amount of neurosis is probably more pleasant. But the reality is nonetheless terrifying... 

Say what you want about Becker, but there is absolutely no pretense of comfort, this book is pure brilliant honesty followed to it's extreme conclusion, and I now feel that this is roughly the correct view of the nihilistic dilemma and the human condition (for worse, as it stands). 

Any thoughts on Becker?"
