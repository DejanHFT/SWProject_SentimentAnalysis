"AskScience AMA Series: I am Scott Solomon, evolutionary biologist, science writer, and university professor, out with a new book on predicting the evolutionary future of humans. Ask Me Anything!",AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/65c3ud/askscience_ama_series_i_am_scott_solomon/,398,3399,"I'm Scott Solomon, an evolutionary biologist, science writer, and university professor. My new book, [Future Humans: Inside the Science of Our Continuing Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/Future-Humans-Science-Continuing-Evolution/dp/0300208715/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1492200514&sr=8-1&keywords=future+humans), considers how we can use science to make informed predictions about our evolutionary future. Recent research suggests that humans are indeed still evolving, but modernization is affecting the way that natural selection and other mechanisms of evolution affect us today. Technology, medicine, demographic changes, and globalization all seem to be having an impact on our ongoing evolution. But our long-term fate as a species may depend on how we choose to utilize emerging technologies, like CRISPR gene editing or the ability to establish permanent colonies on other planets.
