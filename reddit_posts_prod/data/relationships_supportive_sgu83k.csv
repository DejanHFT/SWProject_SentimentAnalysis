Is it normal to be friends with an ex and be vocally supportive of her new relationship?,Rabid_DOG_17,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/sgu83k/is_it_normal_to_be_friends_with_an_ex_and_be/,11,0,"I (27M) dated a girl (25F) for nearly 2 years only to break up last summer shortly before I had to move for work (my first and only relationship). The breakup was amicable as we recognized that long distance was unfavorable and that some aspects of our varying cultures were incompatible with one another. We have remained friends since then, although communication is now entirely limited to texting. 

Due to the amicable nature of the breakup, I still hold her in very high regard and think fondly of our time together and continue to encourage her to be the best person she can be, same as when we dated. 

Now, she has begun to see someone new who is of the same cultural background as herself and I feel conflicted. Unsurprisingly, communication has greatly dwindled and it’s disheartening to experience this slow loss of she whom I’d consider to be my best friend. Still, I find myself supportive of her new relationship and let her know as much for the new guy offers her that which I could not: cultural compatibility. This brings me a sort of somber joy (if that makes sense) to see her happy with someone else as I still care and value her happiness above all else, even if it’s to my detriment. 

That said, is it normal to have such feelings? It seems uncommon to remain friends with an ex, let alone be supportive of her dating someone else. And yet, while I feel remorse for how things ended up, I feel some joy seeing her happy. How can this be? I wouldn’t say that I retain romantic feelings for her, but there’s still a great deal of respect and appreciation for her.

TL;DR Ex broke up with me and started dating someone new, yet I find myself marginally happy seeing her happy with someone else. How can that be?"
