Nintendo isn't exciting anymore.,DickWriter69,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/12w21wk/nintendo_isnt_exciting_anymore/,57,0,"They are too far behind in hardware that it feels like I'm multiple console generations behind

They lack innovation and risk nowadays. Everything about the company feels so soulless and void of personality. This is why the Wii U/3DS Era was incredible: Nintendo actively communicated with the fanbase and they weren't like every other company that didn't try to cultivate a unique and deeper relationship with it's consumer. They took more risks and pumped out more content

Sure, the games were of varying quality, but you'll never strike gold if you always play it safe

I feel like if Nintendo were given next-gen hardware like the PS5 and Xbox Series X, we would have so many groundbreaking video games and an unrivaled lineup of exclusives. Hopefully in 2024 there is actually a new console, because I'm bored of the Switch."
