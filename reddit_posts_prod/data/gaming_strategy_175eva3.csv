Why did Final Fantasy move away from the turn based action?,1chainz88,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/175eva3/why_did_final_fantasy_move_away_from_the_turn/,1238,2097,"The final fantasy games were some of my favorite genres until the moved to the real time combat action when fighting mobs.

To me FF was always more of a laid back strategy game and I really enjoyed that. The fights were compelling to have a strategy for a boss or mobs. It was low stress and you could basically play the fights as fast or as slow as you wanted.

Was there a reason they moved away from this? I really miss it, and I was hoping at some point that a new age FF game would have the ""This side of the screen vs the other side of the screen"" turn based option with all the cool and updated effects of combat."
