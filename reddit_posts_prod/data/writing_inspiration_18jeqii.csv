Tips for fantasy world-building inspired by real-world cultures?,dejjjjorz,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18jeqii/tips_for_fantasy_worldbuilding_inspired_by/,2,1,"I wanted some advice and insight on how y’all might approach the idea of extrapolating world-building elements from ethnic cultures. 

My WIP is currently pulling from my Filipino heritage in the context of a Sci-Fi perspective, and while I want the world-building to be present and clear about its Filipino roots, I also don’t want to misrepresent the culture or use it merely as a world-building device.

Does anyone have tips on how to incorporate cultural elements into world-building in order to create a unique, culturally-representative atmosphere and setting which coincides with plot movements?"
