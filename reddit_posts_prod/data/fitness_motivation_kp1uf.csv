"Fittit, I had a motivation revelation today that I want to share",iPlunder,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/kp1uf/fittit_i_had_a_motivation_revelation_today_that_i/,118,362,"I got out of my class and had a 3 hour break. For a while now I had been meaning to start running, so I thought maybe today. But, sitting there in class I realized why this was a dumb idea. I felt sick to my stomach, I have a bad cold, and there will be way more fit people at the gym, and a lot of them. Then, suddenly, I realized why this was exactly the problem. I ate too much yesterday and feel sick, I have a cold because I haven't been active at all, and if I am worried about what people think, that is why I need to do something about it. Ultimately, if I feel this bad today and run, then any other day I have no excuse not to run. And I did run. And I feel fantastic. "
