Have I already missed the <insert country> mythology inspired fiction wave?,bookrants,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/16mk31q/have_i_already_missed_the_insert_country/,5,1,"For context, I've been developing my Philippine Mythology inspired novel for the past 15 years now and I know that there's been a spike on non-Classical/Norse Mythology based novels that started some five years back. It's something I've been mulling over this past couple of years as I have lost motivation in writing it.

For context, my running elevator pitch is Power Rangers meets Percy Jackson for a young adult audience. Honestly, reading that back I'm not even sure any agent would find it interesting. LOL"
