Hume Discussion Anyone?,spicynihilst,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/h1puc/hume_discussion_anyone/,1,2,"The following is a quote from part II of Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion.


“Look round the world: contemplate the whole and every part of it: you will find it to be nothing but one great machine, subdivided into an infinite number of lesser machines, which again admit of subdivisions to a degree beyond what human senses and faculties can trace and explain. All these various machines, and even their most minute parts, are adjusted to each other with an accuracy which ravishes into admiration all men who have ever contemplated them. The curious adapting of means to ends, throughout all nature, resembles exactly, though it much exceeds, the productions of human contrivance; of human designs, thought, wisdom, and intelligence. Since, therefore, the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also resemble; and that the Author of Nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man, though possessed of much larger faculties, proportioned to the grandeur of the work which he has executed.”

Is this a good argument for the existence of God? What objections (if any) can be made against this argument? Feel free to bring up anything related to Hume's ideas about religion and the existence of God."
