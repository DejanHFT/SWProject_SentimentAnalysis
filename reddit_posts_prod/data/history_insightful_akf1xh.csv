"Recently discovered letter detailing my great-uncle’s death in the US Army at the Battle for Brest, France. Would love to hear insight.",im_a_betch,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/akf1xh/recently_discovered_letter_detailing_my/,2,7,"Hi everyone,

I’ve recently discovered this [letter] (https://imgur.com/a/ZO1TTjJ) that describes the circumstances surrounding my great uncle’s death in France during WWII. He was a captain in the US Army and was supposedly killed during a German ambush. 

My mother doesn’t really know how this letter came to be in our possession as it was addressed to his widow and my mother never had contact with her. The only assumption we can make is somehow my grandfather came into possession of this letter at some point and it wound up in our archives. 

One thing that has my curiosity piqued are that the person who wrote it did not sign it with any military title. I suppose it could be assumed this was a close friend of my great uncle? Or would this be more of a letter a superior officer would write home to the family of soldiers killed in action? We also discussed the possibility of this being a transcription of a written letter someone typed up after the fact. I’ve tried to google the sender’s name but it didn’t turn up much information. 

In short, we have this intriguing piece of family history, and we’d love to learn more about it in anyway possible. If you have any insight or thoughts on the letter I’d love to hear them. 

Regardless of whether we get some leads or further information, it’s still an interesting find for us and we’re glad it lasted through the years. Maybe you’ll find it interesting as well. Thank you!"
