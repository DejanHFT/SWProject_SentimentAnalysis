I achieved my first backflip last night. By the end of the night I landed around 20.,dfort1986,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1o8jgb/i_achieved_my_first_backflip_last_night_by_the/,246,928,"I've always fantasized about being able to do a backflip. It was my second visit at a gymnastics gym and the instructor was pretty confident he can get me to successfully land them. He spotted me on my first try. Second try I landed with no spot. The rest of the hour I was just flipping around joyously. Just proud of the accomplishment and felt the need to share. 
Here's a video of me landing 2
