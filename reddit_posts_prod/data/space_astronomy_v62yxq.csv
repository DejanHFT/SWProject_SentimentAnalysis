How to get started on amateur astronomy??,GlumOrdinary5889,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/v62yxq/how_to_get_started_on_amateur_astronomy/,29,1,"So basically I am really interested at working for NASA but then there is not much I know about space.

I figured that I should try out amateur astronomy to build some knowledge and experience but I am really lost and don't know where to start.

I've found some astronomy courses that gives me credits but I cannot invest that much time since I am still in school (high school).

Not of the YouTube videos I found were step-by-step.

I want some sources that guides me along the path since I do not do so well when I am left alone in an unknown field to study on my own. Even with some minimal guidance, it would be greatly helpful.

Anyone help?"
