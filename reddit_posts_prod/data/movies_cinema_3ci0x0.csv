The Iron Giant is apparently being re-released to cinemas later this year with new scenes added.,smurfy12,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3ci0x0/the_iron_giant_is_apparently_being_rereleased_to/,631,7533,"**TLDR:** The ""Signature Edition"" has two new scenes, is about 10 minutes longer, and will be shown in one-off screenings across the US on September 30 and October 4. No info about other countries or a home video release yet, but a Blu-ray release is very likely as TIG has never come out on Blu-ray before and Brad Bird has [previously stated](https://twitter.com/BradBirdA113/status/459024616896229377) that he wanted to do something special for it. More details coming at San Diego Comic Con (which starts tomorrow).

Brad Bird [tweeted this](https://twitter.com/BradBirdA113/status/618464520504233984) earlier:

>Good to be working with an old friend. See #TheIronGiant at #SDCC & learn more about the #SignatureEdition #rerelease

And [Fathom Events lists](http://www.fathomevents.com/event/the-iron-giant-signature-edition/more-info/details) The Iron Giant: Signature Edition:

>Enjoy this special director’s cut of “The Iron Giant” which has been remastered and enhanced with two all-new scenes.

>Fathom Events and Warner Bros. are excited to bring The Iron Giant: Signature Edition to select cinemas nationwide for a special event screening on Wednesday, September 30 at 7:00 p.m. local time, with an encore event in select markets on Sunday, October 4 at 12:00 p.m. local time.

>When “The Iron Giant” arrived in theaters in 1999, it was hailed as an “instant classic” by Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal and the world soon learned another “giant” had arrived as well: filmmaker Brad Bird, who made his stunning directorial debut with this film and has gone on to win two Oscars, as well as worldwide acclaim for his work on both animated and live-action features. Winner of 9 Annie Awards, “The Iron Giant” is being remastered and enhanced with two all-new scenes! The Iron Giant: Signature Edition will be re-released in theaters across North America for a special Fathom Events screening on Wednesday, September 30 with an encore event on Sunday, October 4.

Looks like there will be about 10 minutes of new content judging by the running time. This will also presumably lead to the film's first ever release on Blu-ray.

More details should be out in the next few days from San Diego Comic Con."
