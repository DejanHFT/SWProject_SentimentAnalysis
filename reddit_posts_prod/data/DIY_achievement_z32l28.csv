Lighting Install Question,hahvaggevabba,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/z32l28/lighting_install_question/,15,9,"Hi all! I’m trying to replace the wired sconces in my house. Directions online looked pretty straightforward… connect white to white, black to black, and copper to the grounded wire or green screw. I was able to achieve the first two steps, but my old sconces only have 2 wires (white and black). It’s an old house, but none of the screws look green either. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank in advance, and apologies if this is the wrong subreddit to be asking in. Thank you!"
