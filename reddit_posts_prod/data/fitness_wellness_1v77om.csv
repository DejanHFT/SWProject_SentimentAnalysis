Looking for corporate wellness program advice,mikeyc252,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1v77om/looking_for_corporate_wellness_program_advice/,1,1,"I work for a 200-person consulting firm. We're lucky enough to have a gym in our building (an old TV studio) and for the past year or so, we've had ""boot camp"" there during lunch. It was put on by a personal training studio, and was mostly circuit training: a lot of body weight workouts, kettle bells, etc. Not a great way to build muscle mass but better than sitting at our desk. 

Now the studio isn't available anymore. Meanwhile, we've added weekly pilates and yoga. So we're at a transition stage, and are looking to replace boot camp with something else. I'm helping pick the new program, and am looking for any thoughts you guys have about effective corporate fitness programs. 

I'd love to do SS or some lifting program, but we need to do the program onsite. We don't have room for more weights, so whatever equipment we use must be transported in and out of the gym. We're looking at Crossfit. Our facility is downtown in a metropolitan area, so during the summer we go outside and do sprints/stairs in a public park--but whatever program we pick has be for all weather...so I think running only is out. 

Anyway, I'd love any advice you guys have. "
