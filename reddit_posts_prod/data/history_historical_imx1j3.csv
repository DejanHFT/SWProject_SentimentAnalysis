Which widely accepted historical 'facts' actually have very little evidence to support them?,lavachequipisse,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/imx1j3/which_widely_accepted_historical_facts_actually/,131,54,"I'm not thinking of falsehoods like the horned viking helmets, I'm more interested in truths that we all accept, but which maybe only have one tenuous source. If you have the expertise, it would also be interesting to hear alternative interpretation of a piece of evidence that has been commonly interpreted in one way."
