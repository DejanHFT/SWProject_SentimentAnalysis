Popular music that has become folk culture,Fizzl3_dizzl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/17qu8a6/popular_music_that_has_become_folk_culture/,467,763,"Just under a year ago Conan O'Brien had Jack White on his podcast. White explains how Seven Nation Army has become a sports anthem (at least the guitar melody has), and he thought it was great. That is pop music, turned folk culture. People can identify it, chant along with it, even though they may not know the origin. Are there any more examples like this?"
