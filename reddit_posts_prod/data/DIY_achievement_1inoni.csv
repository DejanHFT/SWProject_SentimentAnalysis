"[Advice request] I'm renovating a motorcycle helmet visor. I'm at the end, but I don't know how to achieve a perfect, glossy surface.",japko,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1inoni/advice_request_im_renovating_a_motorcycle_helmet/,7,4,"Hi /r/DIY !

My motorcycle helmet visor has gathered small scratches from cleaning off bugs throughout the years. It's made of some kind of plastic. Thousands of tiny scratches evenly distributed in all directions make the vision a bit and at night, the lights  are scattered, rendering the visor useless, especially in the dark.

So I decided to renovate it, using water abrasive papers. I used 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000. I spent something round 8 hours with the abrasive papers, and then I used a polishing paste for automotive lacquer. I polished the surface with felt and I tried out two methods:

- applied paste to surface and immediately started to polish, adding a drop or two of water, when the paste started drying out. Then removed the eccess paste under tap water, then polished to the final gloss with the softest cloth I found.

- the method advised by the manufacturer - apply a thin coat of the paste to the surface, wait for it to dry, then polish.

The first one was almost satisfying. Then I tried the second, making it worse. WTF, AutoMax. Anyway, neither of them gave me the perfect gloss and even after the first method, the visor still gave minor light reflexes from light sources at night. Usable, but not 100% satisfying. I [uploaded a pic](http://i.imgur.com/BLaWOVO.jpg) (it's taken after using the second polishing method. Other stuff there is artifacts, dust or cat hair). I want to get rid of those tiny scratches that are visible around the flash reflection.

How?

**tl;dr how can I polish a plastic surface of a motorcycle helmet visor to a perfect gloss/get rid of micro scratches?**"
