What can be achieved as a natural bodybuilder?,eric_twinge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2m3coq/what_can_be_achieved_as_a_natural_bodybuilder/,248,292,"Alan Aragon recently released the opening article from his August 2014 [research review](http://www.alanaragonblog.com/aarrindex/) to non-subscribers.  

The article is a quest spot written by researcher Eric Helms, who asked that it be made available to the public because it addresses many of the controversies of this highly polarizing topic in fitness and bodybuilding circles. The aim is to provide a rational, organized, scientific perspective - along with plenty of food for thought.

**edit**: I see several people are learning about FFMI for the first time and marveling at their high scores.  You should be aware that the fatter you get the more inaccurate this metric gets.  So if you're pushing 25 and don't look like you lift, it may be time to start cutting...

From [citation #2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7496846) in the linked article:

>Fourth, our formula may not be satisfactory for fat individuals. Because a gain in the fat component of the body is consistently accompanied by some gain in the lean component, it is possible that fat individuals might be able to exceed substantially an FFMI of 25 without steroids.

Note that I pulled that quote from [Lyle McDonalds's review of said paper](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/research-review/fat-free-mass-index-in-users-and-nonusers-of-anabolic-androgen-steroids-research-review.html/).
