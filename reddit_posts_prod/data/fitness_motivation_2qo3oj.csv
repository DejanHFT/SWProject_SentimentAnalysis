What's your Motivation?,RecurvBow,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2qo3oj/whats_your_motivation/,20,0,"With this year quickly coming to a close, I know that the resolutioners will be hitting the gym in mobs in a few days/weeks. That will inevitably spur my ""I'd rather not go to the gym and wait around for a 10 minutes just to lift a weight/do a machine"" feelings which lead to me sitting at home.

As someone who is grossly overweight, I have joined a gym last month and was going pretty sporadically with my brother and his girlfriend. The problem is: I just can't find my motivation. So, what motivates you?

The before and afters I've seen here are amazing! I just cant seem to find my motivation for continuing to spend the money and go to the gym.

EDIT: I guess I should add: I'm more looking to the people who went to the gym to be healthier. The people who were overweight/obese and then stuck to it and reached a goal (or a milestone), not so much the people who were always active or thin and just wanted to bulk up/define. What kept you motivated when you wanted to quit? What kept you determined to succeed? What finally made you go 'No more. Time to change.'?"
