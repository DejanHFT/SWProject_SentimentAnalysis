"Is it pointless to critique movies that are meant to be “dumb, turn your brain off” popcorn entertainment?",xwing1212,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/mf477n/is_it_pointless_to_critique_movies_that_are_meant/,38,0,"When Godzilla: King of the Monsters came out in 2019, movie critics weren’t too kind to it. The movie currently sits at a 42% on Rotten Tomatoes and the critical summary says that while the movie has amazing special effects, the story is quite poor. 

Now, I remember hearing people rebuking critic reviews by saying things like “you don’t come into a Godzilla movie thinking it’s going to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars” or “of course the human characters are bad, the human characters in Godzilla movies are always bad!” 

The same can be said about many blockbuster type movies whether that be Transformers or Fast & Furious but does that mean critics are basically looking at these movies the wrong way? You don’t watch these movies to find the meaning of life, you watch these movies to be entertained!"
