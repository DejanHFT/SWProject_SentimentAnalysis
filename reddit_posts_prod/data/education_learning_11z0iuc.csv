Scholarly learning for non students,c8ball,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/11z0iuc/scholarly_learning_for_non_students/,17,14,"Does anyone know where a non-student can continue learning about topics they are interested in? 

I’d love to keep learning but I don’t trust the internet to tell me what is and isn’t biased research. For example, Ted talks but lectures on learning things/topics/series.

(I am not looking for anything influenced by groups that benefit from sharing skewed/untrue information, Ex: religion) 

Thanks for any recommendations!"
