What is your favorite negative review of a bad movie?,ggroover97,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/qrp9wr/what_is_your_favorite_negative_review_of_a_bad/,3397,14628,"When it comes to reviews of bad movies, some of favorite reviews are short and to the point. For the 2010 comedy Vampires Suck, which spoofed the Twilight movies, Rolling Stone movie critic Peter Travers only wrote ""This movie sucks more."" 

There's also [Roger Ebert's review](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/freddy-got-fingered-2001) of Tom Green's Freddy Got Fingered where he wrote:

>""This movie doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't below the bottom of the barrel. This movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels.""

With that said, what is your favorite review of a bad movie whether it be written or in a video?"
