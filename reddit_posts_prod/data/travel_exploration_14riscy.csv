Dubrovnik to neighbouring countries or explore Croatia?,bayyon,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/14riscy/dubrovnik_to_neighbouring_countries_or_explore/,4,1,"Wife and I are going on a 8 nights trip to Dubrovnik. I’m trying to decide between two options. I plan to stay 4 nights in Dubrovnik, explore old town and enjoy beach life After that I plan to hire a car for 4 days and do either of the following.

Option 1
Drive to Budva in Montenegro, then to Kotor for two nights. Drive from Dubrovnik is about 3 hours. From there, drive to Mostar in Bosnia for two nights. 3 hours drive. Then on the way back to Dubrovnik on the last day, visit the Kravica waterfalls. Flight is late at night.
As there’s crossing borders involved I will need to spend another 120 euros at the car rental on top of the rental fee.

Option 2
Drive to Split then to the national parks of Krka and Plitvice lakes. Haven’t figured out of where to stay, how many days etc. Drive from Dubrovnik totals 5 hours end to end.

Anyone who’s travelled these routes with any input would be much appreciated!"
