"What was your most delicious ""unintended"" substitution?",lindymad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/hh477l/what_was_your_most_delicious_unintended/,45,33,"By ""unintended"" I mean a substitution that happened because you were trying to use what you had, or suddenly realized that you were missing an ingredient, as opposed to buying specific ingredients to try a recipe with a substitution to see how it tasted, or because the original ingredient was not suitable (due to allergies, dislikes etc)."
