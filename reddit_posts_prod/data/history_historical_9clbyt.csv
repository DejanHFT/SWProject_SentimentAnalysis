"Someone recently asked about the worst historical inaccuracies in Hollywood. That got me thinking, what have been the most historically accurate films.",uglyslippers,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/9clbyt/someone_recently_asked_about_the_worst_historical/,78,51,I would say I found the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan to be accurate. Even the way the sound cuts out after an explosion goes off behind him. I had an explosion go off near me once and it was similar to that.
