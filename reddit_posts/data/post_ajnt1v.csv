Why is poker so hard for AIs to play?,benjaminikuta,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ajnt1v/why_is_poker_so_hard_for_ais_to_play/,25,6,"Why is poker so hard for AIs to play? 

I heard that AI still isn't clearly better than top human players at no limit hold 'em. 

Also, in light of the recent Starcraft match, and the Go defeat a while ago, are there any other games of strategy that AIs haven't beaten yet? "
