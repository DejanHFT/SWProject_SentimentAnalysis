Genre fiction vs literary fiction question,Coldboy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/w5cb46/genre_fiction_vs_literary_fiction_question/,15,5,"I've seen questions about genre vs literary get posed here and there on this subreddit, but most of it is just poo poo-ing the snobbery that comes with it all and ""read what you like don't worry if it's profound/intelligent enough blah blah blah.""

My question is this: if you look up the difference between literary vs genre you'll find that one of the main discrepancies is that literary fiction is more character driven while genre fiction tends to be more plot driven. But the only differences to me seem to be a more advanced vocabulary, more complex metaphors/allegories and a dizzying prose (aka just harder to read) in literary fiction. Anyone else find this?"
