Movies to get you motivated,kelevra80,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1ez06g/movies_to_get_you_motivated/,107,33,I watched The Fighter the other day and it really inspired me to hit the gym hard the next day. Does anyone have any recommendations for other good films to get me motivated in the gym?
