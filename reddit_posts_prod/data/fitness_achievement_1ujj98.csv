Simple tips for achieving your 2014 fitness goals - from a long-time competitive athlete. Let's get your tips in here too!,avanoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1ujj98/simple_tips_for_achieving_your_2014_fitness_goals/,55,58,"Some background before I start: I wrestled competitively for 11 years - internationally for 5. During those years I typically had to maintain 3-4% body fat while competing at a high level and maintaining incredible fitness. These three tips then have kept me fit for 9 years since as well.   

1. Fitness is more about intelligence than pain threshold: This may sound like a given, but few people truly understand what it means to work out smarter rather than harder. To achieve the extra numbers, we push through reps, mess up our form, and grunt like our lives depend on it. But the reality is, all that pain doesn't necessarily make you fitter, it could get you injured, and it's not impressing anyone either. If you want to get fit, focus on pushing hard within the context of form (doing exercises right), function (understanding for what purpose you are doing the exercises). 

2. Fitness is 70% what you eat and 30% how you move your body: I know people talk about this on r/fitness, but talking is different from embodying: you are what you eat. Exercising all day won't necessarily get you a fit body... that requires eating well... and eating well for the fitness goals you have. If you want to run a marathon healthy eating for you will be different from if you want to dead lift a lot of weight. Don't get me wrong - exercise is vital to ANY fitness program... and should be a huge part of EVERY fitness program. But many people make diet a far #2 and don't understand why their goals are slow to come. 

3. Burn repetition into your psyche: Find a plan that's right for you, and do whatever you must do to ensure that you follow your plan. With fitness, results don't happen after a workout or a meal. They happened as we repeatedly engage in a well balanced fitness program designed to achieve our goals IF we actually engage the fitness plan. So inspire yourself, get advice, and keep going. I get email reminders to view inspirational images like this: http://placeboeffect.com/rplacebo?id=634 and this: http://placeboeffect.com/rplacebo?id=632 and about 50 other relevant images daily. The little things do a lot to inspire me to stay on track. Find your little things, stay inspired, and KEEP GOING! 

I hope these tips support you in achieving your 2014 fitness goals. I look forward to hearing what works for you too!
