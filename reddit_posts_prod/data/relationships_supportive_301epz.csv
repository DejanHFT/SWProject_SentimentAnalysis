"My friend [21F] is involved with her ex-boss [35M] who is married with 4 children. I want to be supportive of her happiness, but I feel it isn't right.",throwaway22493,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/301epz/my_friend_21f_is_involved_with_her_exboss_35m_who/,88,114,"As in the title, my friend [21F] is in a ""relationship"" with her ex-boss [35M] who is married with children. This has been going on for about 2 months now, but she just recently told me. She seems very happy with him, and as far as I can tell, her treats her well. She just got out of a 5 year relationship that was extremely unhealthy and where she was not happy at all. This man seems to make her very happy, and I want her to be happy, but I am so not cool with infidelity.

I have talked with her briefly about what her expectations are in this relationship, and at this point, she seems to just want to have fun with it. This man makes a very good amount of money and is helping to support some of her life financially, which also worries me.

His wife is suspicious that he is cheating and suspects that it might be my friend that he is cheating with. She tells me constantly how ""crazy"" his wife is and that he doesn't love her and that they were forced to get married because she got pregnant. I can sympathize with someone being unhappy in a relationship, but marriage is no joke, and I don't think cheating is the answer, regardless of how unhappy you may be. He tells my friend that he doesn't care if his wife finds out, but at this point he has no real intentions of ending the marriage. 

The entire situation is completely messed up in my mind, but is it any of my business? I am just worried that things are going to blow up in her face and someone is going to get majorly hurt. I have indicated to her that I do not approve, but I don't know what else I can or should do. What should I do, if anything at all? 



   
**tl;dr**: My friend is having an affair with a married man. I don't approve of the situation, but I don't know if it is any of my business to try to intervene. And if it is, what should I do?"
