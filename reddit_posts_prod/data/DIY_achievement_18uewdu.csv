Please help me with ideas to fix this lamp,Fluffy_Priority_9753,https://i.redd.it/eso2rt8ghf9c1.jpeg,5,3,"This very handy lamp with a battery has snapped at its neck unfortunately. I do not want ro buy a new one since it works as of now. Please help me with ideas of how to fix it. I am thinking of melting plastic over the broken part but it is rather complicated to achieve, maybe this community has some ideas. Thank you"
