"If I do research for the factual portions of my book / gather inspiration from mythology, do I have to give credit, and if so, in what form?",wilderfast,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/f9hllz/if_i_do_research_for_the_factual_portions_of_my/,65,462,"I'm writing an alternate history novel set during WW1 with significant fantasy elements. In order to create a more ""realistic"" book, I have been doing a significant amount of research, watching documentaries and reading history books.  

Do I have to give credit to my resources as I would with a scientific paper (having written one of these, I'm aware of the rules there, but I don't know how they carry over to fiction), especially considering that I'm not directly quoting anything and in most cases I have no idea where I got a specific fact?

I've also been reading a lot of books on mythology and trawling the Internet for sites that describe certain legendary creatures, do I have to quote those (I'm only using sites that describe creatures from myth and legend, not copying fantasy game wikis or anything like that)?

Finally, during the story I'm obviously going to be involving a fair number of historical people going from heads of state to those of the military leadership that are well enough known to be easy locate on the internet as well as writing scenes set in real locations. Is that something that could have negative repercussions, or does the standard disclaimer about the people in the book being fictional or being used in a fictitious manner sufficient to cover my ass?"
