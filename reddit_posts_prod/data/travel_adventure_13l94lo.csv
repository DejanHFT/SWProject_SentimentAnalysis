Sri Lanka in august want to go on adventure travel tour,bambambud,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/13l94lo/sri_lanka_in_august_want_to_go_on_adventure/,2,1,Hello I want to a tour of Sri Lanka in august and I see so many adventure travel companies offering tours there. Does anyone have ideas about who to pick? I’m in my 40’s traveling solo and want to do some active days and exploring and eating. I’ve used g adventure and Intrepid in other countries and found them to be decent.
