"I accidentally bought almond extract instead of vanilla extract and, holy shit, it’s so delicious.",PoopMobile9000,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/imuae1/i_accidentally_bought_almond_extract_instead_of/,363,3884,"I always liked almond croissants and things like that so I knew I liked the flavor, but it just has never occurred to me to actually buy some and use it.  It’s so good.  Have used it for French toast and sugar cookies so far.  I feel like I’m going to use it so much now.

Edit: Wow, seems like I’m not the only one!!  So many great ideas here.  Cookies of course; all kinds of pies, crumbles, cobblers and cakes; custards, creams and creme brûlée; in coffee; as a supplement to any vanilla recipe step at 2:1; and alongside rose and orange water."
