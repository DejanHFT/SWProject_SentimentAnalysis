Having trouble coming up with a melody,Kairi3927,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/10puldf/having_trouble_coming_up_with_a_melody/,3,0,"I can very rarely come up with a melody on the spot. I usually try humming or whistling till I find something I like, but all it takes is two notes for my humming to fall into a song that already exists. And it's very frustrating, cause though I do like to mimic elements of songs I like, I can't bring myself to copy something that someone else came up with, I feel like that would be disrespectful to the composer and unfulfilling for me.

Does anyone have any tips on thinking up original melodies?"
