"Can you help me find this dog a home Reddit?  She was dumped on the Motorway and left to die, please help!",kirmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dcfqm/can_you_help_me_find_this_dog_a_home_reddit_she/,393,423,"Folks I am a one woman Beagle saving operation from across the Atlantic for you USA Redditors. My on line mate from the States is due to have a VERY BIG operation in 10 days time. Last week she was driving down the Motorway and found this beautiful wee girl cowering after being dumped out of a car. My mate has cats and isn't a dog person but she is a truly good woman and wants to save this little girls life. All of the no-kill shelters are full and won't take her and all that is left is the kill shelters. She has tried all options open to her to re-home this little mite but has met nothing but brick walls. She cannot hold on to her for much longer. Please Reddit help me find her a home where she will be loved, nurtured and doted on. And here [she](http://imgur.com/12ZsN.jpg) is and also [here](http://imgur.com/0q6ZU.jpg) aaaand [here](http://imgur.com/UoM1C.jpg)

This is her story according to my mate:

*Do you know why I cannot advertise the pup locally on Craigslist or in the paper? Because dog fighting is HUGE here in North Carolina, and she could easily end up with a group like that being used as ""bait"" to teach much larger, more powerful dogs how to rip other creatures to shreds. It's scary stuff over here. The level of disregard for ""helpless"" creatures is just massive and disturbing. So, gimme your email and I will send you some piccies of the little dear. Here's what I know about her:*

*She's about one year old. She is not fixed. She is a long-legged beagle - this may indicate cross-breeding, or non-purebred lines although her coloring, face, etc. all scream BEAGLE!!! We're kennel training her now, and also working on house training. Like any other dog I've known, she will get into litter boxes (#1 reason I don't like dogs, by the way) and use them as snack carts. She loves chasing cats and tries to convince them to chase her - it doesn't work. She's learning the simple things now, like ""sit"" and ""fetch"" and is beginning to learn that we prefer to let her outside rather than let her pee on the carpet. Our out of town jaunt last weekend blew away any work we'd done with her in the previous week, since our house sitter is an utter git and must have ignored the poor dog all weekend. She crapped and peed all over the house, and I got to clean it up. Now, I get to hire carpet cleaners before surgery to ensure the smell of urine doesn't make me permanently ill after anaesthesia. She is very much the epitome of a beagle - loving, friendly, HIGHLY energetic, loyal, easily bored, easily distracted and she's honestly not the brightest crayon in the box. I think she'll take well to training eventually, but proper training will take dedication. I think she'd do excellently in a house with other energetic dogs, or playful children. She has been tested and found negative for heartworms, and has been given preventative. She is in Winston-Salem.*

If you can help her find a home please send me a message and I'll pass it on to my pal. P.s. no money wanted or required but a forever home instead please. xxxx
