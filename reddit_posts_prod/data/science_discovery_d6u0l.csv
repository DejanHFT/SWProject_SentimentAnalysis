"If you could choose one scientific discovery to be made that would most change our lives for the better, what would it be?",SgtAwesome,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/d6u0l/if_you_could_choose_one_scientific_discovery_to/,728,83,"Human society is a mess in all sorts of ways that seem unfixable within our lifetime. Transformational change would be good.

I cant see past Free Energy. Be it a workable Cold Fusion http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4I5mgBKPZY , a zero point vacuum thing http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaihbfM3C5k , or something based on what Tesla was on about http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRf0UFgJymU , Free Energy would totally revolutionise society.

For starters, assuming the technolgy was widely available, simple to operate and cheap to build and maintain, you could desalinate ocean water and green the deserts, pretty much eliminating world hunger. Eliminating energy costs means massively decreasing our dependence on oil (still need plenty for plastics, pesticide etc). Resources become easier to obtain leading to less scarcity meaning less incentive for conflict. 

EDIT: A few more....

The existence and understanding of (and access to!) other dimensions and how they interact with ours. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkxieS-6WuA
The singularity (not a discovery as such...) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDvdEQJOew
ET disclosure - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh0ByBkhEtQ

EDIT: This has for the most part, reaffirmed my faith in the reddit community. I asked myself this question before I went to sleep last night and had an intense dream where Ringo rode the Queen´s horse and told me about how important the number 14 is. It was too esoteric an answer to understand so I thought I´d ask Reddit. Lots of clever people here. Some great discussions are getting buried so I thought I´d offer links to them. Hope thats ok.

And I meant ""FREE"" energy. ;-)"
