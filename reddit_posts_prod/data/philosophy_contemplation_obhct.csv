I'm reaching out for some guidance for a possible Senior Thesis topic,Perceive,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/obhct/im_reaching_out_for_some_guidance_for_a_possible/,11,3,"I haven't put much thought into what I'd like to write about but what I find myself contemplating a lot about is Knowledge. I'm considering writing something about knowledge but I'm not sure exactly what.  
  
I'd like to include the role of eros in learning/knowing and the importance it serves. But I'm not sure what else I can add. I feel as if it's not enough to write in 20 pages.
  
Besides knowledge, I've been thinking of a thesis topic related to how life and death go hand-in-hand but I don't know anything at all for such a topic.  
  
I'm just asking for some ideas to help me have a more refined thesis topic. I'm pretty much open to anything. I'd really appreciate the help and if you have any books to recommend then please, provide me with info! Knowledge is endless!  
  
Thank you so much!"
