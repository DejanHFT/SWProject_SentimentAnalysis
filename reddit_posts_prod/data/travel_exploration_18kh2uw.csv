Anyway to explore Perito Moreno glacier without going through Hielo e Aventura?,confidenceman00,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18kh2uw/anyway_to_explore_perito_moreno_glacier_without/,1,1,"Hey!

I'm visiting El Calafate Jan 29 to see Perito Moreno and was wondering is there anyway to explore the glacier without paying so much $$$ through Hielo e Aventura (who charge 350 AUD / 190,000 ARS)?

Can I rock up in person and find something? Even a boat tour?

Thanks so much for your help :-)"
