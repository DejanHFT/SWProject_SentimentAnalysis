What is your career and how do you apply your philosophic inquiry to it?,Santabot,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/jykbl/what_is_your_career_and_how_do_you_apply_your/,12,7,"This is a question for scholars of Philosophy or one who simply reads or contemplates Truth, Life and Meaning.

My personal experience in Philosophy started in high school while taking an introductory philosophy course. I later went to university with a Philosophy & English double-major, later dropping the Philosophy program as I found academia to be wholly unsatisfying and mostly full of muck which was no where related to what I had read in many volumes.

I studied far ahead and have read most of the classics through postmodern philosophies, back and forth through influences and the birth of concepts and ideas.. really a thoroughly interesting ride, and truly enhanced my understanding of the world around me and my ability to interact with it. I later dropped out as a senior in English as I felt that it was my true love of philosophy that lead me into the program and was only tangentially related in that it was contained in books and concentrated writing.

I've since started a large private library and exchange / sell books online through various methods and venues. I've decided to go back to university as an Entrepreneurship student, looking to get a more hard-lined understanding of the accounting and legal practices involved in owning a business - and may probably continue my passion for books with an MLIS degree afterwards (my initial plan under English) to become a librarian and/or archivist.

What is your background, and how has philosophy changed your life?"
