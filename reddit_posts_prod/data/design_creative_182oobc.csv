Does anyone here actually ENJOY working in design?,Boogle345,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/182oobc/does_anyone_here_actually_enjoy_working_in_design/,150,74,"Seems silly but I’d like to know because I honestly don’t see it or see how someone could. If there’s a lot of people that do it would be nice to hear stories to inspire hope. 

I graduated school six months ago and have walked away from two design jobs because it was dog shit pay and expected extreme constant immediate work with little time to actually design. In such a short time frame the expected work ethic ruined my mental health more than the abuse I faced years in of retail and restaurant roles. Like seriously I could work at a chick fil a and make only 2 dollars less than what these jobs offered and have a way less stressful work environment that takes over my life. As a recent grad these have been the only jobs receptive to me after over 200 applications.

I enjoy DESIGN but when put into the workforce I actively resent it. I see so many people on this sub desperate for internships, desperate for an opportunity to prove their skills and I was one myself, now I’m not so sure but I’ve known people who have design degrees and attempt to work in it and just end up going back to retail jobs or restaurant jobs and are much happier.

I feel a lot of people in design are artists and creatives and feel the only way we can earn money through a creative outlet is through a design field,the majority give up independent artist pursuits and settle to use creative energy at some kind of company because we’re not so sure something better is out there.

I could be way off base, if you’ve read this all thanks for humoring me and my 4 am thoughts and ramblings"
