I Miss Objectively Bad Comedy Movies,chrismatic13,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/rl7cy9/i_miss_objectively_bad_comedy_movies/,150,85,"I will admit I have a lot of predisposed bias, and part of nostalgia is looking at the past with rose-colored glasses, but undeniably there were a lot more films growing up that didn't take themselves too seriously and as either innocuous or foolish and irreverent they were. Now it feels as if there are very few comedies, but the ones that get released have this similar humor and focus a lot more on the plot than the actual jokes. I know that sounds like a weird critique because, in essence, that doesn't seem like a bad thing but personally, I miss turning on a comedy film that I knew wasn't this Avant-garde masterpiece but was so stupid it would distract me for 2 hours and make me laugh.

A movie like Balls of fury is unanimously panned, and I could even consider it a guilty pleasure, but the fact it doesn't take itself seriously and is this terrible movie with middle school humor appeals to me in a Freddy Got Fingered way. Movies like White Chicks, Drillbit Taylor, 30 minutes or less, Click, Paul Blart, etc. are movies that were critically panned by critics but took risks and weren't trying to be this great film. Not every comedy film that is released needs to be a masterpiece or Monty Python. I'd personally rather watch a bad comedy movie that made me laugh than a ""good"" comedy movie in which I'm stale face the entire time."
