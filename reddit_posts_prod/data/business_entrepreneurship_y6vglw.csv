are entrepreneurship apprenticeships a thing?,anna_arbatlian,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/y6vglw/are_entrepreneurship_apprenticeships_a_thing/,5,3," i'm currently a first-year student studying in college and i was wondering if doing apprenticeships related to entrepreneurship is a better option (I'm thinking of opening my own business in the future)? I'm in co-op so I'll definitely be doing internships if i were to stay in college. but I'm not sure if i want to stay in co-op because it is a really intense program and i don't think i can handle it (mentally speaking). and i can't how co-op can help improve the skills that i need to open a business. at the same time, choosing to only studying one semester after the other won't exactly help me either. my university only offers entrepreneurship as a minor so that won't get me a degree. I'm not really sure what to do so any help is appreciated!"
