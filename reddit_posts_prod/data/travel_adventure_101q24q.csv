“Choose you own adventure” trip with in-laws,superpurpleu,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/101q24q/choose_you_own_adventure_trip_with_inlaws/,5,2,"My husband’s parents gave us a very generous gift for Christmas - they are letting us choose between 6 locations to go on a vacation with them this year (my husband is in grad school so we can’t afford to travel much on our own right now). We have already eliminated two of them but the remaining locations are: Greece, Mexico, Hawaii, and Prague/Vienna/Budapest. (We live in the western US)

We would easily choose one of the European locations because we have always wanted to travel to Europe together, but we have an almost 3 year old son and a 3 month old daughter and I don’t think we will be able to leave them behind this year. Would those locations be enjoyable at all with kids that young? My in-laws are in their early 50s and very fit and helpful, and my kids are relatively easy, but they are still young kids. 

If those locations are not reasonable to do with kids those ages, which Hawaiian island(s) would you recommend? We already went to Mexico with my in-laws a year ago so Hawaii might be a fun destination for all of us. 

All of these options are exciting to us but I would love some advice on where to travel with young kids if anyone here has experience! Thanks in advance!

(If it makes a difference, I have been to Hawaii as a child and Prague/Budapest in college, but my husband and in-laws haven’t been to any of the locations except Mexico)"
