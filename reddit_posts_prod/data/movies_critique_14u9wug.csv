"I find this new wave of ""Rich people bad"" comedy thrillers kinda meaningless.",GabikPeperonni,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/14u9wug/i_find_this_new_wave_of_rich_people_bad_comedy/,55,0,"Yesterday I watched The Menu and found it fun, but I didn't really love it. It goes along this new trend of ""wealth critique"" suspense comedies that have been showing up, like Knives Out, Green Onion, Triangle of Sadness and The Menu. They're all fun, little comedy clicks that make you feel smart for getting all the metaphors and stuff. I personally believe Triangle of Sadness is the one that most successfully creates a meaningful and thoughtful statement and communicates what it's trying to say, but regardless. 

Everytime I watch one of these, I feel like I'm being manipulated by the movie itself. It's that constant feeling of ""how's it going fellow kids"" throughout. I've yet to watch a movie of this new genre that is self-referential and self-aware, because that's what they should be. They're made by the people in the movie and often for the people in the movie. The foodie critic character in The Menu (who, by the way, was so in-your-face-bad) would be indistinguishable from a real movie critic. Portraying the working class as poor little servants of the rich is effective I guess, but it loses meaning when they're being portrayed by an A-list or B-list actor. They're easy movies to make because we are easy costumers to please. 

I don't know if I've made my point clear and I know it's always going to be an industry by elites for elites, but I just wanted to speak my mind about it. I don't get the praise these movies are getting."
