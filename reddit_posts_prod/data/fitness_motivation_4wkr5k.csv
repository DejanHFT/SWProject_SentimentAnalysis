Motivation,Shaferthefree,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4wkr5k/motivation/,9,1,I finally hit my weight goal that I had been working hard for that past 6 months. But after reaching that goal I found a sudden lack of motivation to head back to the gym.  So I was curious about how anyone else deals with this problem. Thank you and have a great Sunday!
