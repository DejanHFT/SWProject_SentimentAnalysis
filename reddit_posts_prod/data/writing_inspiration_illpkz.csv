Am I bad writer if a good chunk of my ideas are in some shape or form inspired by something?,coldrod-651,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/illpkz/am_i_bad_writer_if_a_good_chunk_of_my_ideas_are/,223,846,"I feel like all of my ideas are inspired by something form media, I've noticed sometimes I do it unintentionally because recently I've been replaying my childhood games and see that they bleed into my stories or characters. So I feel like can't come up with anything original lately, so am i a bad writer? If so how do I fix it?

Edit: sorry I didn't get to all of you right, its was 2 in the morning where I live so I wanted to get some sleep"
