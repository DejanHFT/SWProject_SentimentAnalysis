[META] Bots and AI tools on r/askscience,AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/zg4sgl/meta_bots_and_ai_tools_on_raskscience/,230,2595," 

Over the past few days we have seen a surge of accounts using bots/AI tools to answer questions on r/askscience. We would like to remind you that the goal of r/askscience is to be able to provide high quality and in depth answers to scientific questions. Using tools like GPT-3 chat not only do not provide the kind of quality that we ask for but they are often straight up wrong.  
 

As with all bots on this subreddit any account using those tools on /r/askscience will be **immediately** and **permanently** banned."
