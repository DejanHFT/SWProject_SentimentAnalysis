To all fellow cinema employees: good luck. Today is the busiest day of the year for us.,ogonga,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5k91hs/to_all_fellow_cinema_employees_good_luck_today_is/,2897,31619,"I have been there since The Hobbit. Walter Mitty and Desolation of Smaug. Into The Woods brought in 5500 people into our theatre. Joy had me ripping at my hairs. The Force Awakens was a massive hit as well. Now with Rogue One, Passengers, and the big Bollywood film, Dangal, we must prepare ourselves mentally, physically, and emotionally. Effective crowd control should be enacted, yet guests should feel welcome. We may be classified as an entertainment industry, but in the end, we provide service most of all. Be kind to your guests, and they will cheer you on. This will be my fifth Christmas spent at the theatre, but I knew it would be this way the moment I signed up for the job. Most places are closed today, so families depend on us for a good time. Live long and prosper.

EDIT: I am genuinely surprised and moved by your responses! Someone gilded me for the first time, thank you! I feel like this made front page, which is new too! Thanks for lifting our spirits and making this a great holiday!"
