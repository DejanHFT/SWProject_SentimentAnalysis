How and where is oxytocin stored in the hypothalamus?,Aaronlvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/11pikw0/how_and_where_is_oxytocin_stored_in_the/,14,460,"Based on my research, oxytocin is synthesized in magnocellular neurons and transported to the posterior pituitary where it is stored in granules before release into the peripheral parts of the body. However, oxytocin can be sent from these magnocellular neurons to other areas in the CNS as well. Are they stored inside these neurons the same way they are stored in the pituitary?"
