Which Literary Characters Do You Have a Crush On?,jtg93,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/77nyiw/which_literary_characters_do_you_have_a_crush_on/,113,25,"Most people have crushes on TV/movie characters, but do you have any crushes on characters from books?

As for me, the first one that comes to mind is Pippa from Donna Tart's Goldfinch. I'm not sure if it's that I have a crush on the character herself, or if I more identify with the way the main character is madly in love with her. 

I also had a big crush on Hermione when I was growing up, but that may have been influenced by the movies as well.

So, Reddit, who are your Literary Crushes?"
