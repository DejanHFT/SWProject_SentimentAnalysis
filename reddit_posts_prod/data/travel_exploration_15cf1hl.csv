Exploring Switzerland with the Bernese Oberland Pass,sirotan88,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15cf1hl,51,1285,"We spent 4 days exploring the Jungfrau region of Switzerland using the Bernese Oberland Pass. I highly recommend this pass over the Swiss Rail Pass because it includes unlimited rides on all the mountain cable cars and gondolas with no additional cost. We tried to take as many trains, gondolas, and ferries as possible in 4 days. I’ve added my own ratings for each of the journeys, based on the views as well as overall experience and comfort of the trip. 

Day 1
- Bern to Thun 3/5. Don’t remember much from the trip in terms of views but it was very fast and convenient. 
- Lake Thun cruise (Thun to Interlaken West) 4/5, the first hour to Spiez is 5/5, but the second hour I started to feel sea sick from such a long time on the lake. Wish we got off at Spiez to explore town and take a train for the rest of it. The boats are very spacious, clean, and feel luxurious.
- Interlaken Ost to Lauterbrunnen 3/5. I don’t recall this being super scenic except for the last part where you approach Lauterbrunnen and can see the waterfalls.
- Lauterbrunnen to Wengen 5/5. You climb upwards and get amazing views into Lauterbrunnen valley. Very glad I picked to stay in Wengen because of this (and the town of Wengen itself is very charming too.)

Day 2
- Wengen to Mannlichen 4/5. It’s a small and crowded cable car, you can pay extra 5CHF to stand on an open rooftop, which is totally worth it for the fresh air and breeze.
- Kleine Scheidegg to Grindelwald 4/5. The views are really pretty as you glimpse into Grindelwald valley, but the train is slow and often quite crowded and stuffy.
- Grindelwald to First 5/5. I didn’t think I’d enjoy First and planned on skipping it originally, but I’m so glad we decided to do it. I loved watching the paragliders, hikers and bikers on our way up. We took Trotti bikes down the mountain which was very fun. 
- Harder Kulm 2/5 just for the ride itself (but views at the top 5/5). Crowded, long lines, hot and stuffy, standing room only. 

Day 3
- Wengen to Kleine Scheidegg 4/5. Really cool views of the mountains, and seeing Wengen from above. 
- Eiger Express (Grindelwald to Eigergletscher) 5/5. Giant, modern car with ultra panoramic views. Feels like a Disneyland ride. Can get hot and stuffy. We were super lucky to get a car all to ourselves. Views at Eigergletscher are amazing. 
- Grindelwald to Mannlichen 5/5. View of Grindelwald valley for the bottom half and then a panoramic view of entire mountain range for the upper half. This one was a surprise! I’m glad we decided to return to Wengen via gondola instead of train for a different view. 

Day 4
- Lake Brienz cruise (Interlaken Ost to Giessbach, & Iseltwald to Brienz) 4/5, but only because it was raining, or it would have been 5/5. The hour long cruise is definitely more enjoyable. We got off at Giessbach Falls, hiked back to Iseltwald and caught a ferry from there to Brienz and took a train back. 
- Golden Pass Express (Interlaken Ost to Montreux) 4/5. Had to pay a bit more to cover the trip between Gstaad and Montreux. The new Golden Pass Express train is very nice, but this whole train trip is a bit confusing with multiple train options. We made a mistake of boarding a car which would be removed from the train at Zweissiman, so we had to get off, waited at Zweissiman for about 30 minutes, and boarded a different train, not the Express but still a modern and comfortable train. 

Tips for visiting the area:
- We rode a few of the gondolas at off peak times and got the entire car to ourself. Went up First around 1-2pm in the afternoon. Eiger Express around 4pm. Grindewald to Mannlichen around 5pm. Gondolas generally close early (5:30pm being the last ride) so plan accordingly, but they’ll wait a couple minutes to make sure they’ve caught all potential passengers.
- We didn’t end up doing Jungfraujoch or Schilthorn. We have no regrets on saving this money and time (each of these is pretty much a full day commitment.) I also learned that Schilthorn is currently undergoing construction so it’s probably best to avoid it until they are done with the construction work. 
- Try to plan all your big activities for the morning between 8am-12pm. Places are much less crowded. For example at Kleine Scheidegg in the morning it was peaceful and quiet (except for the cows grazing and bells ringing), in the afternoon the place was swarming with big tour groups.  
- You can also combine Bernese Oberland Pass with the Half Fare Card. This helped make our travel outside of Bernese Overland region cheaper. It also gives you a discount on the BOP itself, so you’re really only paying a little bit extra to get the half fare card."
