CinemaSins kind of sucks now,DiamondPup,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/493zdz/cinemasins_kind_of_sucks_now/,526,2292,"I used to love this channel and would look forward to new uploads every week or so but lately, I've lost interest and I wish someone else would pick up the formula and do it better.  I opened up one of their new videos this morning and couldn't finish it.  It was awful.

The idea is still great; nitpick a movie, expose plot holes and writing flaws and provide trivia all in an entertaining, tongue-in-cheek way.  But what made CinemaSins stand apart from everyone else doing it is that they used to be less about comedy and more about *actually nitpicking the movie*.  It was always interesting and insightful first and comedy second, or at least that's how it seemed.  That's what made it so fun!  You walked away with something.

However, lately Jeremy and crew are just obsessed with being funny.  It's all in-jokes and running jokes.  Scene does not contain a lap dance, (actress) is not my girlfriend, (character) is eating an apple and is therefore an asshole, etc.  These bits were originally funny because they were rare and would get a smirk out of me; it was a play on the flawed narrator, sure, great.  But it went from being 2% of the sins to like 50% now and shows no signs of slowing down.  Everything is just attempts at humour and it's got to the point where a lot of their new vids miss very obvious sins because they're too busy looking for ways to be funny.  I would actually watch movies, catch a flaw and think 'I can't wait till the CinemaSins guys get this and skewer it' and they blow right past it because they're making another old joke.

It's a shame.  I really loved this channel but it looks like the idea has been abandoned for the sake of entertainment.  There was a time once where, if someone took that idea and ran with it, I'd think 'hey these assholes stole CinemaSin's idea!' but now I'd rather welcome it.  At least someone should do it right.

Thoughts?"
