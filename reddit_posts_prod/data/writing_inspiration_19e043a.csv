"Is discipline enough to write a novel, or do you need inspiration as well?",Suitandbrush,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/19e043a/is_discipline_enough_to_write_a_novel_or_do_you/,12,5,"A piece of advice I latched onto early on is the idea that you don't need inspiration, you need discipline. Sit around waiting for an idea and you will wait forever, writing involves actually writing. Just start writing literally anything, and make it work.   


That idea served me well for short stories, I've written a good amount of short stories by just grabbing a topic at random , writing it to the best of my ability, finding it's core in revision, then fixing it in editing. I've made some stories I think are really good, and got received pretty well, that way.  


However, it just hasn't been working for me with writing a full length novel. I didn't have any ideas for a novel, but I really wanted to write one, so I tried the same thing I do when I don't have an idea for a short story, and just start writing SOMETHING, then getting into a shape with plot structures and all that. I wrote 4 drafts, and then showed it to a bunch of people, and got the general reaction of ""you don't have a story here, there is no emotional core"". And upon hearing that I realized they were absolutely right.  


I've put that novel in a trunk for now, and am restarting. However, this time I am debating how to start, and whether the problem with the last book was that I didn't have an idea I cared about when I started. Maybe going off of sheer discipline doesn't work for novels, and you need an idea that you really care about, or something you want to say, or anything like that, to make a story that can hook someone for 200 pages. And the ""just run at it"" technique only works for short stories. And I should not try to write a book again until I actually have a story i want to tell. Or maybe I am overthinking it and just wrote a bad first book and need to just try it again with any random topic.  


What do you think? Can a good novel be written about anything, and its best to just start writing and work with sheer discipline? Or is there a certain amount of inspiration that is necessary to make a novel that really works?"
