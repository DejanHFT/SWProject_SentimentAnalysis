"Do you wait for inspiration to write, or do you write and hope for the inspiration to come?",kcrosswriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1ko1sv/do_you_wait_for_inspiration_to_write_or_do_you/,54,24,"I'm working on a first draft of a second novel that is really flummoxing me. I also wanted to write a short novella, but couldn't think of much. Someone told me to just wait, and let the ideas come. Another friend told me she'd never been visited by inspiration and it was a waste to wait. I wrote about 20 pages worth of a totally crappy story in the meantime. 

So my friend wrote a guest post for me today about how Disneyland is like writing (http://kcrosswriting.com/a-writers-life-for-me-how-the-writers-life-is-like-a-day-in-disneyland/). She instructs people to get to work while waiting for inspiration. As I said, that didn't really work before.

So what do you do? Do you wait? Do you write? Do you write and wait? Have you ever HAD inspiration, or have you just had to work really hard?

Thanks guys!"
