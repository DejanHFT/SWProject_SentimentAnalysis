Literary clock: made it!,Bookclock,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9332ld/literary_clock_made_it/,32,131,"So I started thinking about making a literary clock quite a while ago, and came here for suggestions. A few r/books users commented on [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4sbz3f/building_a_literary_clock_using_time_indications/) with useful quotations from books, and [u/Sssnapdragon](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sssnapdragon) pointed to a fantastic list which made all the difference. 

I thought I'd show the result: an e-reader which tells time using quotations from works of literature. [https://www.instructables.com/id/Literary-Clock-Made-From-E-reader/](https://www.instructables.com/id/Literary-Clock-Made-From-E-reader/)

There are still quite a few minutes of the day that do not have their own quote, so if you come across other mentions of time while reading, please let me know. Thanks!"
