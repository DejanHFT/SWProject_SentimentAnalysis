G Adventures - Peru,MacMan50,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/185negq/g_adventures_peru/,4,2,"I’m a 40-year-old considering taking a G Adventures hiking/camping trip in Peru. I’ll be traveling from Midwestern USA.

The two trips that have caught my eye the most are the 1) [Classic Peru Inca Trails tour](https://www.gadventures.com/trips/classic-peru/PPC/?ref=asearch) and 2) the [Amazon to the Andes Inca Trails tour](https://www.gadventures.com/trips/amazon-to-the-andes/PAA/).

Can anyone recommend either of these two tours or another one around 10-12 days that you’ve done before that you would recommend? Likes dislikes of the tours? Age range of yours and number of travelers? What was the camping portion of the trip like?

Any tips or suggestions are welcome!"
