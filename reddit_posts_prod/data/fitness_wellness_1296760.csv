Is this PPL routine well-balanced or is it too much volume?,theworllddisyours,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1296760/is_this_ppl_routine_wellbalanced_or_is_it_too/,21,8," 

I started lifting weights 1.5 months ago but used to do calisthenics before. I've been reading articles on recommended volume and all that stuff and it seems like I'm doing way too much volume on chest( 24 sets a week) and back(30 sets), however i've seen a lot of progress on virtually all exercises and aesthetically as well so I was wondering if the routine's fine or what should I change up
