My boyfriend is overly supportive,overlysupportivebf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dte63i/my_boyfriend_is_overly_supportive/,98,11,"We’re both 23, both cishet and have been in a relationship for around 1 1/2 year. 

I have this huge insecurity about my flat chest and I’ve been vocal about it. My boyfriend does his best to express he’s attraced to my non existant boobs but this is a deeper issue for me so I’ve considered getting a boob job. 

I’m honestly not a fan of surgery and cosmetic surgery is against my personal beliefs (I don’t judge people who do it I’d just rather go about my insecurities in a different way). But it’s gotten frustrating to try and love myself with lots of therapy and it hasn’t worked for years. So I’m considering the boob job (but am not deadset on it, I already have the money so if I was sure I’d have gotten them done by now) and obviously have mentioned it to my boyfriend. 

The thing is he’s overly supportive of it. Like downright excited that I’m considering it. And it really offends me. I just wish he would tell me ‘hey I support you but will also support you if you decide to not do it because I love you anyway’. And I know people are gonna tell me to just talk to him but I really don’t know how to approach it. Hey you’re supporting me too much to get cosmetic surgery done and it makes me feel even more insecure about what I have right now. 

We haven’t had sex in weeks. I just tell him I’m having a super long period which also explains why I cry so much around him. I’m just really sad about all of this. 

TL;DR - I have a flat chest, mentioned getting implants, boyfriend is way too supportive/excited about it. Makes me feel 3x more insecure than I already was and I can’t stop crying or be intimate with him.

Edit: to every man basically calling me crazy at this point — imagine you have a 3 inch penis. Your girlfriend says she loves it but you know it’s not ideal because, you know, you live in the real world. You briefly mention something about thinking of getting a penis enlargement and your girlfriend, who always claimed to love your 3 inch penis the way it is because she knows you’re sad about it, is really really happy about it. She repeatedly and excitedly tells you to get the enlargement when you’re not sire that’s what you want and you only mentioned it once."
