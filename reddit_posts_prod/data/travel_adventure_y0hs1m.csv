June Tropical/Adventure Honeymoon Suggestions,AllThingsBread,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/y0hs1m/june_tropicaladventure_honeymoon_suggestions/,3,2,"My fiancé and I are looking to do our honeymoon in June 2023. Please spam me with suggestions! Flying from Chicago.

He wants more beach and relaxation time and I want to explore and have an adventure. Therefore, we’re hoping for a mix of both. I’m down to plan a multi city trip and city hop, but we also want to spend at least 3 nights in each location so we’re not constantly traveling. 

We have discussed Greece, Southern Italy, Croatia, and Mediterranean islands. Thailand was a top choice until we realized it would be rainy season on the west. We’re also considering the Caribbean, but are more interested in traveling to a further destination since it will be a once in a lifetime honeymoon. 

Budget: No more than 10-12k would be nice.

10 days-2 weeks 

We’ve been to Hawaii together and though we would love to go back, may be out of budget. We’ve also been to Lake Como and Puerto Rico together. I’ve been to Lagos, Cinque Terre and Florence.

I am the most indecisive person. Thanks for your suggestions!"
