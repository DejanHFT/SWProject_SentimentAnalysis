What's the musical rhythm/melody played at the start of an opera classical music concert?,lemonmec,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/184k2v3/whats_the_musical_rhythmmelody_played_at_the/,19,35,"tried searching about it but to no avail....It's like the
musicians are ""testing"" their instruments before the act starts. What I usually hear is the sound of violins playing a single note altogether and then they change the notes. Every single opera/classical music concert I watch has this thing before it starts and while people are sitting in their designated seats. I’ve searched for it and found the term “overture” but it’s not really the word that I’m looking for.

I hope someone can understand what I'm saying."
