**Critics Consensus**=Stepping out from Rocky Balboa's iconic shadow at last, the Creed franchise reasserts its champion status thanks to star Michael B. Jordan's punchy direction and a nuanced heel turn by Jonathan Majors. Read critic reviews  




**Publisher, score= quote**  

**Arizona Republic 4/5**= “Creed III” is definitely a people movie. And Jordan has trained his lens on the right subjects.  


**Houston Chronicle 4/5**= ""Creed III"" is an intensely enjoyable continuation of the Creed story, one that doesn't pack a lot of surprises in its punch but nonetheless goes the distance.

**Chicago Reader, Fresh**= In his directorial debut, Michael B. Jordan brings a surprisingly heartfelt though formulaic addition to the Rocky franchise.

**Consequence, B**= Whether Rocky fans will take issue with the lack of Stallone or some of the film’s bigger swings, there’s a confidence to respect in this film, as it tells a story which feels fresh within the established framework.


**Chron, Fresh**= At its best, the movie takes the unlikely shape of a yuppie-in-peril thriller about chickens coming home to roost, Cape Fear reinvented into a Shakespearean sports drama.  

**The Playlist C+**= But just as a great boxer can’t pull the same trick over and over again, neither can a franchise, an issue previously the cause for the steep drop-off in quality among the nonetheless lucrative “Rocky” sequels.


**Huffington Post, Fresh**= A fascinating film from a new director who seems unafraid of moments of teary defeat that manifest into something far more introspective and self-nourishing — even when that’s between two brawny Black men at odds with each other and themselves.

**Slant Magazine 2.5/4**= Creed III comes down to a draw between its flashes of brilliance and its missed opportunities.

**Independent UK 4/5**= Can the Rocky franchise exist without Rocky?... Creed III, finally, has actually answered the question at hand. And it’s done so with a firm and enthusiastic “yes”.

**Indiewire B-** = An overcooked script... keeps Creed III from landing every punch it throws. Overall, though, it does prove victorious: Jordan clearly has directorial skill, and he and Majors make for a formidable onscreen duo.


**Entertainment Weekly B**= Creed III suffers from a certain lack of heft and specificity in its storytelling structure, a sense that the original bare-knuckle magic is not all there. But it's also often better than the blunt-force melodrama of the last film.

**Guardian 4/5**= A rare sequel that comes close to restoring one’s faith in the worth and legitimacy of the franchise as a concept, the latest chapter in what might well be the best we have right now.

**Hollywood Report, Rotten**= Jordan uses the full power of IMAX to direct some glorious fight scenes... These flourishes will surely delight many fans of the franchise, even as the narrative -- the reason we keep watching Adonis fight in and out of the ring -- lets us down.  

**Premise**= After the events of Creed II (2018), Adonis ""Donnie"" Creed is thriving in both his boxing career and family life. When a childhood friend and former boxing prodigy, Damian ""Dame"" Anderson, resurfaces after serving a long sentence in prison, he is eager to prove that he deserves his shot in the ring. The face-off between former friends is more than just a fight. To settle the score, Donnie must put his future on the line to battle Dame – a fighter who has nothing to lose.
