"How legit are videos of ""AI robots"" like Sophia?",pagodi,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7b421o/how_legit_are_videos_of_ai_robots_like_sophia/,11,16,"Lately I've seen a few videos of AI robots that seem to be very capable of understanding & responding to human speech. [Here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LguXfHKsa0c) — a video of a conversation between the robot Sophia & her creator.

My question is, are videos like this really showing a robot that's understanding & responding to human conversation? Or are their lines maybe pre-programmed or being controlled by humans? It just seems like the abilities of robots like these are so far beyond the capacity of other tools we use — e.g., its voice recognition technology seems really strong compared to Siri or Alexa, and its ability to understand & respond meaningfully to sentences once they're recognized seems really strong compared to all the chatbots I've seen.

Do robots like this really represent huge leaps in AI? Or are they sort of a set-up gimmick?"
