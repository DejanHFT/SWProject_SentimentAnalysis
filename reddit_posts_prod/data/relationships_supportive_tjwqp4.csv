"I can’t stay attracted to caring, supportive girls, but I don’t know how to avoid it",SomeKind-Of-Username,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tjwqp4/i_cant_stay_attracted_to_caring_supportive_girls/,5,2,"Dunno why I let this happen to myself again, I actively avoid dating because it always turns to shit, but I got to talking to someone online again recently, and it just kinda turned into a romantic thing and I guess I stupidly went along with it cause I don’t fucking learn my lesson apparently. 

The first couple months were ok, I was mostly just getting swept up in it cause it was new and exciting and I’ve also been massively isolated by choice for a very long time. But the we obviously kept getting to know each other, and there’s certain aspects of my life that I guess are objectively shit. I can kinda dance around them for a while, but eventually certain topics come up that make it unavoidable. 

I never want to bring them up, but if I lie about stuff, then what’s the point of even talking to the person at all, cause they’re not actually getting to know me and they’ll find out eventually anyway because my mental state is so unstable. 

So I just feel like I’m forced to kinda say it when it comes up, and it always leads to the same fucking outcome, it’s usually something along the lines of “I just wanna give you a hug” or something like that. And it’s fine in a stand-alone instance like that, but it always ends up being the first of a long string of equally sympathetic statements and shit cause there’s a lot of shitty stuff in both my past and present and it keeps coming up once someone tries to get to know me on a deeper level.

I can’t explain it fully, but once someone starts saying that supportive stuff, I just can’t maintain an attraction to them. It feels almost nice at first, but I really start to hate it pretty quickly and it just makes me angry and frustrated when I hear it but I can’t ever seem to explain it in a way they understand, which just leaves everyone even more confused and drives us apart. Sympathy and empathy and that sorta stuff is just such a turn-off for me.

I know the best solution here is just not to get involved with people, I try not to, I stay 100% isolated most of the time. But occasionally it happens naturally like it did here and I get swept up and wind up hurting someone I actually liked at some point because I feel like I lead them on and then killed the relationship just because they had a very expected and normal response to my trauma. Just adds to the feeling that I’m a selfish asshole who can’t be around people. I feel like I kinda wanna just find a girl who hates me on some level or just doesn’t give a shit, so at least we could maintain some kinda connection and I also wouldn’t have to feel bad about myself if shit when wrong.

And just cause I know people are gonna say it, I’ve already been in therapy for three years, had more than one therapist in that time too, and been on more medications than I care to remember. I also exercise daily, eat well, all that shit. But none of it helps with this issue or really any others either.

TL;DR - I can’t bring up anything about my past without either the girl I’m talking to feeling the need to be sympathetic or just lying to her about it to avoid that. I find sympathy and support to be an instant turn-off, and it keeps killing my relationships before they even start."
