Songs with the same melody,Noah2029,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/15m3jke/songs_with_the_same_melody/,10,2,"Does anyone notice songs that have the exact melody, with totally different artists? There are 3 songs (so far) I have found that have the same melody and the song starts with it every time. 

Like the way - Ark Woods
When I'm Gone - Jaychef
Up, Up, and Away - Erik Cane

You only have to listen to the first 10 seconds to hear what I am talking about. Maybe they all used the same producer or something but I found this by accident and thought it was interesting."
