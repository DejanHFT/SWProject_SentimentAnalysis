Strategy games for ps4?,MattyVonStooly,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10w41wf/strategy_games_for_ps4/,6,7,"Hi folks, 

Title says all. My laptop broke down and canâ€™t play eu4 anymore. Most of the time I find strategy games that I played on the ps4 bit clunky and made for PC rather then console. This is not really a strategy game but M&B is a good example of this. 

Which games do not have that?

Looking for something like civilisation/eu4/ command and conquer red alert/ stronghold crusader/ Any fun (medieval) city builders are welcome as well.

Cheerio"
