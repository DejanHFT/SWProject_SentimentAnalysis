"r/fitness, when you began working out, what kept you motivated to keep going?",HydratingFIRE,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/r68pc/rfitness_when_you_began_working_out_what_kept_you/,89,16,"I'm in my second week in. My body is aching! I had so much motivation, perhaps a big ego to help push me, but now I feel surprised how well I pushed myself the first week. Yes, I am losing the sense to stay engaged to becoming fit. How did you keep it going? 

EDIT: Thanks you all. These comments have helped me kick it in another gear. Many of you answered simply just to be stronger, and be able to lift more. Some mentioned sex."
