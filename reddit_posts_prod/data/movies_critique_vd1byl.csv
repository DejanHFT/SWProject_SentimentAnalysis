Some advice before you see Memoria. This is not a review or critique.,Skyrafarig,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vd1byl/some_advice_before_you_see_memoria_this_is_not_a/,14,4,"As of this writing, *Memoria* will be released in 55 additional theaters across North America through October 1, 2022. After seeing the film and reading of polarized responses across r/movies, I suggest you complete this 10 minute exercise before buying tickets. I suspect it will help determine whether your experience will be uncomfortable.

Set your phone and other stimuli out of reach. Sit comfortably with your back straight but relaxed. Observe the elements of consciousness--sensations, sights, smells, sounds--without judgment. In other words, observe without thinking actively of what is observed. When thoughts appear, let them drift away without engagement.

This exercise is a simplified form of vipassana meditation. If you can do it for 10 minutes without agitation at the lack of deliberate stimuli, I believe your viewing won't end in frustration. Otherwise, I recommend against seeing *Memoria*. 

*Drive My Car* is *Memoria*'s filmmaking antithesis. Drive My Car rewards good students. It suits the analytical. *Memoria* punishes that behavior--not intentionally, but attempts to make sense of it within the landscape of film and other texts are likely to result in agitation. Trying to ""make sense"" of the movie with concepts is like describing a magic mushroom trip to someone who has never experienced one. The most articulate only come so close. 

This is why many describe *Memoria* as an experience. That sounds pretentious and doesn't effectively communicate what's going on, and yet it is the best explanation we have. My wife likened the experience to being trapped by the Devil's Snare in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*: The harder you struggle, the tighter its grip. You have to relax and let the film take you where it takes you. 

If this all sounds like nonsense, Memoria is probably not for you."
