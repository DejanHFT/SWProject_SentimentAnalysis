What's the best audience reaction to a movie scene you've witnessed at the cinema?,Averybleakplace,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18db5h6/whats_the_best_audience_reaction_to_a_movie_scene/,5327,5276,"For me it would have to be when Captain America manages to summon mjolnir in avengers endgame. The theater just erupted.  It seems as if everyone was just as invested as the characters of the movie at this point given the amount of movies that had been before it. 

When I went to the cinema to see endgame it might be the most phenomenal experience I've ever had at a movie theater. 


So whether it was a jump scare that got the entire audience or a comedy scene that made the entire audience laugh I want to hear it."
