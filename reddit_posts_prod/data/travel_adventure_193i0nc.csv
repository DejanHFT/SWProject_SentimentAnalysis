Packing for G adventure trip first time solo trip,loulou1984,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/193i0nc/packing_for_g_adventure_trip_first_time_solo_trip/,15,3,Hi just looking for advice. I am heading on a 2 week trip to Mexico on 18-39 trip with gadventures. I just read their website and they recommend using a duffle bag for the trip! I am travelling solo for my first time and wondered do people bring suitcases! Currently packing and now panicking Iâ€™ll be the only person lugging a big case!
