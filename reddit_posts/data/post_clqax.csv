I just witnessed something horrible at a Wal-Mart and could really use any help. Please help me.,insecu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/clqax/i_just_witnessed_something_horrible_at_a_walmart/,1348,893,"I just finished talking to the cops and still feel a bit shaken. I could really need some advice and opinion. Maybe I just overreacted? Should I have acted differently???

This happened today **July the 3rd, 2010 at around 15h20PM** in the food section of Wal-Mart in **Sherbrooke, Qu√©bec** near the chips and the bread rows. I don't usually go to Wal-Mart and haven't gone in years, but I wanted to enjoy some specials on paper and orange juice. First thing I noticed is how ""packed"" the place was. There were people everywhere! It was hard to move around, especially in some sections.

Suddenly, I heard a little child crying. It was coming from the section I was going too and I remember thinking ""Damn, I'm so unlucky, I need to go there exactly at the moment a child is crying."" Well, nothing unusual, little children cry sometimes.

As soon as I arrived, I noticed the father: he was wearing a thin black shirt and black pants. His hair was totally unkept and he looked quite dirty. He had sweat spots on his shirt. He looked really agitated, angry and nervous. The child looked around four or five years old. He was as high as my knee.

First thing I hear is him telling his child to ""Shut his goddamn fucking mouth right now"" (in french). I don't really know what to do and I am really close now. Then, something happens. Something bad.

As the child keeps crying, the man raised his hand really high. Then, he hit him really hard behind the head with his hand open.

I have rarely seen violence and even more rarely seen it in such a situation. It's not like in the movies. I have no idea what to do: I feel lost, stunned and shocked. It just happened so fast.

The little kid falls and his head hit the ground directly. He falls directly on the ground. He remains there a second or two, then raises his head again. And then comes a sight I will never forget.

The child is crying and his mouth is full of blood. I can clearly see his upper left front tooth is chipped: a large part of his tooth his missing and blood is dripping on the floor. He's crying even louder.

I looked around: SURELY someone will do something. There are at least fifteen people around. BUT NONE OF THEM IS DOING ANYTHING! Everyone is just minding his own business, buying more crap and doing their own things. Only three people are watching, including an old lady that appears seriously spooked. All three would eventually move away without a word, keeping their routine like the others.

I go to the man and say something stupid. He answers something as stupid. I am totally at a loss for words, completely lost. I say: ""I don't think you should hit your son like that."" He says: ""Oh yeah?"" Then, he walks away, like the others.

What should I do? Should I call the police? I look at the little pool of blood on the ground. I get my phone out and take a few pictures. I try to find the piece of tooth that the child lost, without success. Should I call the cops? Probably. But I'm in Wal-Mart, surely they have policies for that.

I go to the nearest ""associate"" I see and explain what happened. He is really absent and not helping. He tells me to go see security. I ask where security is and he says: ""Either in electronics, either in clothes, either with cashiers. Probably with cashiers."" I go at the entrance and cannot find a security agent. I talk to a cashier named ""Dominique"" who is very sweet and helpful and calls a security agent for me. The agent takes FOREVER to come! Surely the man has already left the store! 

After around 10 minutes, the security agent arrives. He looks tired, like I'm bothering him. He barely listens to me, often looks away and he nods nonchalantly. He finally tells me that he will ""inform his boss"". That's it. He doesn't even ask for my name or a description of the man. He seems to think I'm exaggerating and just generally a bother. ""These are corporate policies,"" he tells me.

I ask if he can make a report, he says that these aren't company policies. Then I say if he is going to call the police and he says... again, that it's not the company policies and that he will inform his supervisor tonight. I finally get enough and say I am going to call the police. He tells me not to and insist they can deal with it internally. I insist and asks him for the local police number (I don't want to bother 911!). He doesn't give it to me.

I dial ""0"" and asks for the local police number. Best 1$ I've spent. I immediately calls and explains I have witnessed child abuse inside a Wal-Mart. The lady on the phone is very nice, takes my name and address and say they will send a police officer immediately.

Now, I think, this is going to take forever! If it took ten minutes for a security agent to move from one point inside the store to another, imagine for police (which are overworked). 

Huge surprise, the police arrives super-fast - within five minutes. They are almost running to me after I signal them. I give them my version of the story, show them the pictures (best best best thing I've done!!!!). They take my name, my address and my full version. We walk a bit inside the Wal-Mart but I cannot find the man with his son. They tell me that they will ask to check video record and match it if he paid with a credit card and then get child services to see if the child has been abused. They thank me again, tell me they will file a police report and that they will call me if they need more information. I ask if I will be updated and they answer no, it's an investigation, etc.

I'm really worried right now. Worried for many reasons. I talked to a few people: one said ""It's only his baby tooth, it's going to grow back. You're overreacting. Look at how all others did not care"". Another said it was horrible and that I should have arrested the man using my citizen rights - but I'm not so sure about this.

I'm really curious to hear your opinions. I could also use some support and help if you have any idea. I'm ready to do anything. The sight of this child with his mouth... Well, it was absolutely shocking :(

Also I can provide my phone number/address to law enforcement or if, by any miracle, someone who was also inside that Wal-Mart and saw what happens - or a person who knows a little child with a recently chipped tooth - happens to browse reddit. Message me.

Any help is appreciated. Thank you, Reddit!

**TLDR: Saw a man beat his son inside a Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart employees were of no help. Called the police. Wondering if I overreacted and if there was anything else I should have done.**"
