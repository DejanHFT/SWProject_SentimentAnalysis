Do current technologies allow for a manmade object to break the speed of sound in water? What would the sonic boom be like?,txgopher,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1alcb9/do_current_technologies_allow_for_a_manmade/,307,1498,"Since the speed of sound in water is higher than that in air, but water is denser, is it possible to break the speed of sound in water? If so, would it be more visible than in air? More devastating? Has it ever been done even?

Edit: wow, MAJOR changes of force involved here. VERY impressed with the the answers already given. Thank you all. Maybe we need to figure something to replicate that shrimp that snaps their claws so quickly the forces reach the same temp as surface of the sun. "
