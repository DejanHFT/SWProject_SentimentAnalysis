As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.**

> Unlike so many of the cookie-cutter, wisecracking-assassin movies in recent memory, ""Bullet Train"" acknowledges its outlandishness from the beginning and yet also manages to connect so many dots in creative, gotcha fashion.

- [Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2022/8/2/23288287/bullet-train-review-brad-pitt-movie-brian-tyree-henry-aaron-taylor-johnson)

> The geographical logic of “Bullet Train” doesn’t make much sense, but then, the movie looks as if it was produced without the principals so much as stepping foot in Japan. And why not? It’s essentially a live-action cartoon, with high-profile cameos sprinkled in for added laughs. Stylistically, Leitch is trying his darnedest to channel the likes of Tarantino and Ritchie, even if the dialogue and mock-British accents aren’t nearly strong enough to earn such comparisons...Ladybug is constantly quoting trite self-help aphorisms, which invariably get a laugh. This may be a fun enough ride, but such punchlines drive home that neither the characters nor the film they inhabit are particularly deep. Quite the opposite, in fact.

- [Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2022/film/reviews/bullet-train-review-brad-pitt-1235331291/)

> “Bullet Train” is not a good movie, but the fun that radiates off Brad Pitt is magnetic enough to convince you that you're having fun, too...“Bullet Train” may be going nowhere fast, but Pitt always seems like he’s already there, safe in the knowledge that we’ll happily watch him smile through all the chaos that crashes around him.

- [David Ehrlich, IndieWire: C](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/08/bullet-train-review-1234746987/)

> David Leitch’s directing credits — Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2, Hobbs & Shaw — have remained firmly tethered to his stunt background, occasionally with entertaining results. But his latest is so busy delivering violent action with a self-satisfied wink that its contorted plotting and one-note characters get real tedious real fast...It’s dispiriting to see so many capable actors put to such poor use.

- [David Rooney, Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/bullet-train-brad-pitt-review-1235190275/)

> Director David Leitch (“Deadpool 2”) again showcases his penchant for insane fight scenes, although the narrative overall isn’t quite up to the snuff of the fisticuffs and gunplay, and the tone is too often stuck between “John Wick”-style seriousness and “Clue”-esque absurdity. But Pitt is game for just diving in and letting loose – as well as getting stabbed, punched, bitten and thrown around like a rag doll – as a steadying presence when the film purposefully goes off the rails.

- [Brian Truitt, USA Today: 2.5/4](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/08/02/bullet-train-review-brad-pitt-bad-bunny/10209879002/?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&utm_campaign=usatodaycommovies-topstories)

> Leitch’s talky, violent hit man movie, with Brad Pitt at the center of an over-cranked ensemble cast, reminds us why Hollywood has all but abandoned attempts to copy the successes of Tarantino and Ritchie. This film is not just bloated, tedious, dim-witted, and glib, it’s also redundant...“Bullet Train” aims to be slick when it needs to be smart, and predictable when it should be provocative—effectively making all of the wrong stops at exactly the wrong time.

- [Todd Gilchrist, AV Club: D](https://www.avclub.com/bullet-train-review-brad-pitt-david-leitch-1849358392)

> The movie, in theaters August 5, largely delivers on the high-speed berserkery of its premise — a manic neon candygram stuffed with cameos and smash-cut chaos, hurtling breathlessly toward its gonzo end...“Bullet Train” doesn't have a destination, really, or a moral imperative other than mayhem. But it's got a ticket a ride.

- [Leah Greenblatt, Entertainment Weekly: B+](https://ew.com/movies/movie-reviews/bullet-train-brad-pitt-sandra-bullock/)

> My brain refused to engage with this glib, terminally self-satisfied blood-and-bullets extravaganza, one that feels like it was plucked from what we might call the “Things to Do in Denver When You’re Dead” period of American cinema, when Quentin Tarantino’s first two features emboldened far too many young filmmakers to think that they, too, could make a zippy comedy with excessive gunplay, explicit gore, pop-culture references, needle drops, and a briefcase full of cash...All “Bullet Train” had to be was high-gloss, all-star, late-summer nonsense, but instead it gives high-gloss, all-star, late-summer nonsense a bad name.

- [Alonso Duralde, TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/bullet-train-film-review-brad-pitt-brian-tyree-henry-sandra-bullo/)
