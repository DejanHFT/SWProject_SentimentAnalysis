Did Creative Market get rid of Free Goods?,aamarie97,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/u785dc/did_creative_market_get_rid_of_free_goods/,56,59,"Does anyone know if Creative Market got rid of their Free Goods of the Week? The page was up yesterday but I just went to check it out today and itâ€™s gone. Not sure if I missed a memo that they were taking it down.

Thanks!"
