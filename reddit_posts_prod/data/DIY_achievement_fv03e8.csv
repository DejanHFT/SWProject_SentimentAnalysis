"Need advice, how to achieve R38 or greater in kneewall area of room addition",mtdew2litre,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fv03e8/need_advice_how_to_achieve_r38_or_greater_in/,9,2,"NC Code requires us to have R-38 or higher in ceilings/attic spaces, I'm converting my 3rd floor walk up into a full living space. The primary ceiling has feet of space between where the drywall will be and where the actual roof is, and judging from what I see on the product description though, R-38 batt insulation is 12 inches thick, so getting R-38 batts in there wont be a problem.

Where I face a problem is the knee walls, They are 2x6 roofing beams, with what seems like a 2x4 married to them, creating what I can only imagine is a true 9 inches of actual space. Will R-38 batt insulation work in that space?

Here's the pics for reference:

Do I need to add another 2x4 to each beam to give myself another 3.5 inches of space? Or is there a better option than the batt insulation?


Thanks!"
