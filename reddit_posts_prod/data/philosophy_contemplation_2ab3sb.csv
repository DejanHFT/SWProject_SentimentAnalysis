The Aesthetic Landscape: A Critique of Sam Harris's Secular Morality,ClintEhrlich,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/2ab3sb/the_aesthetic_landscape_a_critique_of_sam_harriss/,32,12,"*The following is a lightly edited version of my unsuccessful submission to Sam Harris's Moral Landscape Challenge. I was fortunate enough to have my last critique of Sam's work published in the print version of Lying, along with his response. Ryan Born is a worthy winner of the more recent contest, but I regret that Sam was not forced to respond to some of the novel arguments in this essay.*


###The Aesthetic Landscape

by Clint Ehrlich


Morality is aesthetics writ large — a criterion for valuing certain arrangements of molecules over others. This is *The Moral Landscape*'s deepest insight. Yet it is also the clearest refutation of Sam Harris's thesis. 
 
I shall illustrate this point with a simple question about aesthetics: Are strawberries better tasting than dirt?
 
Most people alive today certainly think so, and we can verify their preference using neuroimaging. Thus, the gastronomical superiority of strawberries to dirt might well appear to be an absolute aesthetic truth. 
 
But is it really so objective? Palatability is not an intrinsic property of strawberries, dirt, or any other substance. Nor are human dietary preferences immutable. Geophagy, the consumption of dirt, has been practiced for thousands of years in cultures around the world. And psychiatric patients afflicted with pica (a rare eating disorder) often consume dirt compulsively.  
 
This raises a normative issue: *Should* humans prefer eating strawberries to dirt? 
 
The answer is only obvious if we refuse to contemplate the question. Any genuine attempt at legitimizing our preference produces a chain of reasons that lead to nowhere. Perhaps people should prefer strawberries because eating dirt is unhealthy. Yet why should people pursue health? Presumably, to prolong their lives. But why should they prefer life to death?
 
This philosophical dead end is not unique to strawberries and dirt. It is the terminus of every attempt to justify human preferences — including Harris’s Moral Landscape theory. Our justification system cannot, itself, be justified, because every justification begets another. If we expect the universe to provide some underlying reason for our existence, then we will spend eternity like Tantalus, reaching for satisfaction that forever eludes our grasp.
 
Perhaps this insight is banal when applied to aesthetics. We know that our individual culinary and cinematic preferences are essentially arbitrary, but this lack of external validation does not prevent us from enjoying our favorite foods or movies. Instead of laboring to rationalize our desires, we devote our time and energy to fulfilling them.
 
But when it comes to morality — which is simply a higher-stakes domain for valuing various states of the world — even atheists like Harris find it difficult to relinquish the superstition that the universe prescribes a fixed purpose to existence. With each attempt to derive absolute moral truths, they merely select some arbitrary substitute for the will of God.
 
Harris accomplishes this by ranking all potential states of the universe according to how much they maximize human well-being and minimize suffering. This ranking is not arbitrary, he argues, because morality depends on conscious minds, which inherently prefer well-being to suffering. Not so. Pleasure and pain are simply the incentive structures that evolution has hardwired into our brains so that we will pass on our genes. But having cast off the shackles of natural selection, nothing compels us to cherish the system of reward and punishment it once used to control us. 
 
The reasoning abilities that apparently maximized reproductive fitness in our ancestors now allow us to decide whether we approve of what evolution hath wrought. In the future, we may engineer artificial minds with thoughts unclouded by joy or suffering. We may even choose to become them.
 
Indeed, within our existing cognitive architecture, well-being is not the prime value, because we are willing to subordinate it to truth. That is the enduring lesson of Robert Nozick's experience-machine argument, which Harris fails to rebut. He notes that a society hooked on Huxleyan soma would be unable to care for itself, but that is an answer in practice, not principle. Technology will eventually give us the option to permanently enjoy blissful unreality. Our revulsion at that prospect refutes Harris’s value system.
 
In declaring by fiat that well-being is alpha and omega, Harris has inadvertently embraced the same fundamentalism as the theists he opposes.  And if his moral philosophy were ever embraced like religion is today, it would be just as dangerous to our world. His anti-suffering framework produces disturbing answers to the most basic question of all: Is life worth living?
 
In Harris's system, perhaps not. Most of us would prefer non-existence to enduring the “worst possible misery” for the rest of our lives. Thus, global nuclear war appears to be an ethical means of preventing everyone from reaching the moral landscape’s deepest valley. How close must we come to that nadir before extinction becomes a moral imperative in order to prevent suffering?
 
Obviously, we would prefer to find a way to improve conditions while remaining alive. But if the value of life can become negative, then it would be immoral not to put humanity out of its misery once the future's expected ratio of suffering to well-being falls below some threshold. Unfortunately, the elevation of this point on the moral landscape would necessarily be arbitrary, because the universe prescribes no fixed exchange rate for Harris's two moral currencies. The extent to which we are willing to endure one in the pursuit of the other is purely a matter of evolutionary programming, to which we are no longer beholden. Given the suffering that billions of people endure today in developing nations, it may already seem moral to transform our planet into a lifeless ball of radioactive ice.
 
Civilization would be better served by unifying its approach to aesthetics and morality. In both domains, we should embrace the fact that our desires require no external validation or justification. This would allow us to create the only truly ‘binding’ moral theory: One requiring all agents to maximize the probability that their goals will be fulfilled. Anyone who deviates from this standard is either making a logical error or misperceiving the state of the world.
 
This may not offer everything we crave from morality. If space aliens arrive on Earth, their goals might appear abhorrent. But humanity’s shared evolutionary history has endowed us with intrinsic desires that are essentially compatible. The best way to maximize the probability of fulfilling our individual goals — and thus the most moral path — will be cooperating to build a peaceful, prosperous, rational world."
