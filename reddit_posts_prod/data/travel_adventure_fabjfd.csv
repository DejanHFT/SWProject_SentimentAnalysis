I'm currently in punta Cana and it feels like I'm doing something quite adventurous...,HarryBlessKnapp,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/fabjfd/im_currently_in_punta_cana_and_it_feels_like_im/,58,283,"Meanwhile it's full of North americans who basically live here or are semi retired and the whole place is fairly touristy. And yet I go to Spain pretty much every year and the roles are reversed. I bet some of you guys go to Spain and feel adventurous yet to me it feels like the touristy retirement home for us Brits. I just thought that was interesting. I'm fairly well traveled and I genuinely felt this was a bold trip and then I realised all the other tourists here are the equivalent of my nan popping over to fucking Benidorm for a long weekend.


Edit: I'm not complaining btw. It's great here for what it is. We're having a great time."
