"/r/fitness, how did you stay motivated to lose weight?",bigman77,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/x4o92/rfitness_how_did_you_stay_motivated_to_lose_weight/,92,16,"I am 22, I am 315 pounds, and I hate it. 

I want to lose weight, even put on a few muscles, but I can't get motivated to do so. I work a desk job all day long, so I'm always sedentary, and when I get home from said job I am generally drained from the work day, and just want to relax. 

Then when I get up the next morning, I'm extra tired due to my sleep apnia ( I have a Cpap but I cant wear it), during the day, my eating habits are poor due to lack of time, and then the quantity of food that I eat is over the top too, I can't seem to not be hungry.

All in all, I'm tired of myself, I can't stand the person I see in the mirror. I want to change, but I can't get physically motivated to do so. 

Any suggestions are welcome, I just need some help.... Thanks reddit  

EDIT1:I'm reading all of your replies, I want to thank you for all of your suggestions, It feels good to have people pulling for you. I will start working on this asap. I know I can do this, now I just have to put it into action."
