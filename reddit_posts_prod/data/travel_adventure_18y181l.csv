"Which would you choose: Puerto Rico or St Thomas for 2 days of adventure, 3 days of beach, and unique local experiences and dining?",fenwalt,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18y181l/which_would_you_choose_puerto_rico_or_st_thomas/,4,1,"We are considering whether going to the Isabella region of PR (Jobos) or St Thomas for 5 days next week.

Cost is pretty much the same whatever so that's not really a concern.

What we are looking for is an authentic, fun, experience. We're going to do an airbnb, rent a car, and want to do some fun exploring for 2 days (ATVs, some hiking, unique sights, ideally some cliff jumping, and generally fun adventures) and have 3 days to soak up the sun before we return to the frozen tundra we live in.

For reference, we stayed at an Airbnb in Aruba, rented a car, went to all the beaches, ate all over, and had so much fun. It was a really fun experience, we felt autonomous and spent a lot of time away from the all-inclusive tourists spots that feel like America. I'm just so jaded by how boring and standard everything in America and all-inclusives is that I'm hoping for something unique.

Knowing only a little about PR and St Thomas, my **assumption** is that St Thomas is more touristy, that it will feel more American, and that we won't have as much of a local experience (local food, bars, etc...). I assume there's less to do on St Thomas as well, although there are fun things to do on St Johns.

But I accept that I could totally be wrong because I'm totally ignorant of both areas, other than what I've generally heard throughout my life.

What would you choose given our criteria?"
