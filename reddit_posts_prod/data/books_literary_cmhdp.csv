Ask /r/Books/: Who is your favorite literary character?,taitbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/cmhdp/ask_rbooks_who_is_your_favorite_literary_character/,175,25,"I think the Samuel Vimes from Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels tops my list. Something about his constant internal struggle between his desire to mete out justice himself and knowledge that he can't ever go down that road makes him so entertaining. Plus he is so well written.

So who is your favorite?

Edit: I didn't know what to expect from this but I love how wide the gamut of choices is."
