Need help getting something done?  I have unlimited flight benefits this summer and want to spend the month of May helping out Redditors.,Generique,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/svoy6/need_help_getting_something_done_i_have_unlimited/,2217,2069,"Following the footsteps of [these guys](http://blog.reddit.com/2009/08/reddits-fatastic-voyage-reddit.html), I want to have a reddit-powered epic summer adventure.  I have the ability to travel on the cheap.

Want me to hand deliver a letter to someone across the country or overseas? Attempt to help you with homework? Volunteer at your organization for a day?  Need an extra pair of hands to do that landscaping project you've been putting off for months?  Know a sweet hiking spot but have no one to go with?

I will attempt to complete the highest voted tasks to the best of my abilities (IE they take place in destinations I can reach- most major cities worldwide except and almost any US destination, and I don't get an unlucky string of fully booked flights).  **Be sure to say the city your request takes place in.**  Feel free to assign me random adventures where ever you live.

I plan on documenting all this, taking pictures and video at each destination, and am looking to purchase a video camera-- can anyone recommend something lightweight?  Also-- **if anyone else has similar benefits you're welcome to join me for any/all of the journey.** We could take turns filming!

I intend on beginning my journey starting on May 7th and continuing into late July.

Miscellaneous note about me:

* 22 year old male unemployed college student

* B.Sc. in forensics

* American citizen

* I won't do anything illegal-- if you want a package delivered I'd like to inspect the contents first  ಠ_ಠ

* Can speak conversational Spanish

* Other skills: amateur game design/mod enthusiast, cooking, playing guitar badly and singing badly

* Likes: hiking, caffeinated tea, rock climbing, long walks on the beach

**EDIT [2]: sub to r/ReVenture (above) if you want to follow the whole thing (wow, I feel like a youtube channel already).  I'm going to spend the next week reading through EVERY post and coming up with an itinerary that maximizes adventure & help/travel time ratio.  Future communication will be through the subreddit.**

In the mean time I'm off for a few days to visit family
