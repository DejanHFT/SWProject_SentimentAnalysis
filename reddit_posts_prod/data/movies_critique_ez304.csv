"Just saw ""The Abyss"" for the first time in its entirety. Here's my critique/rant. ",jacewillow,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ez304/just_saw_the_abyss_for_the_first_time_in_its/,4,7,"[Spoilers below]

Up until last night I had only ever caught James Cameron's 'The Abyss' in bits and pieces on TV. But last night, through Netflix, I finally watched the Special Edition in full. Here's my rant, which is kind of a rant in regards all movies like this.

I don't mind a movie prodding me to think. 2001: A Space Odyssey, Inception, Mulholland Drive--these are all good films that messed with my mind. They also have ambiguous endings, of which I am a big fan. But I absolutely hate it when a movie tells me what *to* think.  

'The Abyss' is a beautiful, hearty film for the first two hours, and then a preachy mess in the last ten minutes or so. It's not that I disagree with Cameron's overall message. But the anti-war/anti-nuclear proliferation themes were already clear and well established. We didn't need to be hit over the head with the imagery and news broadcasts at the end when Bud visits the aliens. 

Also, the idea that the aliens would have spared humanity simply because Bud expressed love for his wife in the message at the end, is absolutely ridiculous. If the aliens could watch the news, then surely they would have already seen that humanity is capable of great kindness, thus negating the need for them to interact with Bud (who becomes, apparently, the savior of mankind).

And if the aliens care so much about non-violence, why did they cause the nuclear sub to crash in the beginning like that, killing all aboard? It would have made more sense if they had just immobilized the sub and held the sailors captive, only to release them at the end.  

It's one thing when a documentary like Super Size Me or Bowling for Columbine presents a clear agenda. In that case I go in knowing what to expect. But it just seemed petty and manipulative for Cameron to tack on the ending like he did, when it's already clearly at that point the message he's trying to send. 

My complaint with ""The Abyss"" is the same as my complaint with Cameron's other works like ""Terminator 2,"" and ""Avatar."" It seems like Cameron is the biggest offender, but by no means is he the only one.  Spielberg pissed me off in The Lost World when the animal rights activist character played by Vince Vaughn secretly unloaded Roland Tembo's weapon, and unhinges the cages to some of the dinosaurs. Well, doing so later made the humans defenseless against the T-Rex, and resulted in some deaths. I'm all for protecting animals, but never at the expense of human life.

Really, I would have preferred a much more ambiguous ending to ""The Abyss."" I would have had Bud simply get absorbed into the light, only to reappear later on the surface, without showing the whole alien city/submarine at the end or the whole tidal wave nonsense.

I don't know. I just feel like this film could have been Cameron's best, but simply fell apart due to his own inability to abstain from tainting his art with manipulative political themes.  "
