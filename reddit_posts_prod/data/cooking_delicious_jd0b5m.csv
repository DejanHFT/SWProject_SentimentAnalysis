College student looking for simple delicious recipes,Davidkob,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/jd0b5m/college_student_looking_for_simple_delicious/,45,15,"I'm in college, and I live in an apartment so I have a kitchen. Something I've realized is cooking is hard. Not the act itself, but the act of spending hours each day making the meals and also cleaning, it just takes so long (something I luckily rarely had to deal with when I was home with my parents, who make delicious Asian foods). I've been making frozen food and chicken for so long and I was hoping this thread could give me some recipes that are easy and fun and delicious (with things that a college kid would use a lot in their kitchen, I don't have a lot of fancy spices or anything). 

TL;DR! in need of recipes that are easy and yummy and quick for a college student with limited things in their pantry"
