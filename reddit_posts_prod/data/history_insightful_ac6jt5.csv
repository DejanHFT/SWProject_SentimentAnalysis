Rome in the 800s,Mrdongs21,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/ac6jt5/rome_in_the_800s/,15,139,"So I've been reading a lot of good history books about the changes in Europe that occurred after the traditional dating of the 'fall' of the Roman Empire, and while they're good and interesting and insightful, I've yet to read much that focuses on the city of Rome itself during all this.

From what I've gathered, the population rapidly declined (lowest about 50k?) and the city itself fell into disrepair, dominated by churches and graveyards. Is this... Basically correct? I guess it's the details I'm interested in, if anyone knew them. Were the big iconic buildings and style of Rome persistent in this period? Would there have been Cathedrals next to ruined temples, or were they built over?

I know that functionally Rome was mostly important as a symbolic seat of authority, where the Pope lived and where the most important rulers were crowned and so on. What kind of people would have lived there? Mostly clergy/artistocrats and their support functipnaries?

Are there any good books someone might recommend for more info?

Thanks! "
