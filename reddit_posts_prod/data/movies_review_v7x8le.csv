> Critics consensus: *Jurassic World Dominion* might be a bit of an improvement over its immediate predecessors, but this franchise has lumbered a long way down from its classic start.

[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/jurassic-world-dominion): 38/100 (48 critics)

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** 

> Whatever goodwill superfan director Colin Trevorrow earned with 2015’s enjoyable reboot, Jurassic World, he pulverizes it here with overplotted chaos, somehow managing to marginalize characters from both the new and original trilogies as well as the prehistoric creatures they go up against in one routine challenge after another. Evolution has passed this bloated monster by.

-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/jurassic-world-dominion-1235161062/)

> Returns had been diminishing since the very first Jurassic sequel in 1997 — no offense, Julianne Moore and you’re-so-money–era Vince Vaughn. And given the way these new movies didn’t add much to the Jurrasicverse other than a rough-riding, more-rugged-than usual Chris Pratt and jokes about Bryce Dallas Howard dodging dinos while in heels, let’s just say that expectations were best kept low. Still, the sheer sloppiness and slapdash vibe of 2018’s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was a bit of shock; you’d have thought the movie was assembled on the go while its creative team was being chased by an extremely angry Indoraptor. At the time, we declared it to be the worst of the Jurassic movies to date. We now owe that film an apology.

-[David Fear, Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/jurassic-world-dominion-movie-review-1362206/)

> With little tension or humor, there’s nothing keeping “Jurassic World: Dominion” afloat beyond the naïve hope that recognizing the familiar will be enough for some viewers. Maybe it will be, but it’s proof that we’re in one of the dullest, most artless periods of Hollywood blockbusters yet — “Top Gun: Maverick” notwithstanding — and we could be stuck here for some time.

-[Siddhant Adlakha, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/06/jurassic-world-dominion-review-1234731384/): D

> Of the three “Jurassic World” movies, “Dominion” is the least silly and most entertaining. But that’s not saying much. This “stop to ask if they should” cycle’s human characters were never especially interesting, and why should we trust Trevorrow to suddenly make them so?

-[Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2022/film/reviews/jurassic-world-dominion-review-1235288084/)

> The generous read on “Jurassic World Dominion” is that it’s a metaphor unto itself; the ongoing moral of the film series is that mixing the wrong strains of DNA leads to disaster, and that lesson is writ large in the awkward and clumsy attempt to graft the stars of the original “Jurassic Park” onto the “Jurassic World” movies, a combo platter that only serves to make the latter-day protagonists even less interesting by comparison. The other generous read, although it’s damning with faint praise, is to call this the best “Jurassic” movie since the original in 1993, but that doesn’t mean this one’s not, much like its predecessors, a hot mess. It’s just a hot mess with some effectively scary bits, a cool car chase and Laura Dern.

-[Alonso Duralde, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/jurassic-world-dominion-review-laura-dern/)

> While Jurassic World Dominion is most certainly an imperfect addition to the Jurassic Park franchise — particularly with the rough presentation of some newer dinosaurs and its lack of faith in audience intelligence — it manages to introduce an impressive marriage between ever-present nostalgia and the constantly evolving challenges of having prehistoric creatures roaming free in our world. Characters new and old keep the film flying high, even if some of the Claire and Owen stuff makes the plane’s engine sputter now and again.

-[Amelia Emberwing, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-dominion-review): 7.0 ""good""

> The film's only major fault is Trevorrow's desperation to ensure that viewers get their money's worth. Jam-packed with silliness, spectacle, intrigue, romance and just about everything else, Jurassic World Dominion has regular popcorn-spilling scares, exhilarating, expertly choreographed action set pieces that would earn a tip of the baseball cap from Spielberg himself, and the numerous characters all have plenty to do.

-[Nicholas Barber, BBC](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20220608-jurassic-world-dominion-review-exhilarating): 4/5

> In that vein, the new “Jurassic World” is more “Return of the Jedi” than “Empire Strikes Back,” giving fans a comfort-food finale that plays a few fresh numbers, but mainly sticks to the hits.

-[Brian Truitt, USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/06/08/jurassic-world-dominion-movie-review/7535848001/): 3/4

> Dominion leans into the notion of a sci-fi dystopia doubling as an old-fashioned monster movie, something Universal knows a thing or two about. Like a ’50s B-movie, Jurassic World Dominion pauses to pontificate about humankind’s place in the evolutionary chain in between sequences that deliver the teeth-gnashing goods. If we have to wade through some silly, pandering nostalgia to get to this pleasingly vast dinosaur playground, so be it. 

-[Jesse Hassenger, Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/23158390/jurassic-world-dominion-review)

> Less triumphant send-off than passable retread, the newest Jurassic only approaches classic when it ventures into uncharted territory.

-[Neil Smith, Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/jurassic-world-dominion-review/): 3/5

> If it doesn’t hit the Top Gun: Maverick heights of legacy sequels, Jurassic World Dominion is scattershot but entertaining, delivering fun, familiar set pieces. Come for the delight in seeing Neill, Dern and Goldblum together again, stay for the bit where a bloke on a scooter gets eaten. 

-[Ian Freer, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/jurassic-world-dominion-2/): 3/5

> This could have been fun, but there is something so arbitrary and CGI-bound and jeopardy-free about it, as the film joylessly chops in bits of Alien, The Swarm, Bourne and 007. And the essential thrill of the first Jurassic Park movie, from Michael Crichton’s novel, is completely gone: that vital sense of something hubristic and transgressive and wrong in reviving dinosaurs in the first place. It’s time for everyone involved to do some original thinking.

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/08/jurassic-world-dominion-review-time-to-drop-the-dead-dino?CMP=twt_a-culture_b-gdnculture): 1/5

> Masochism is Jurassic World Dominion’s only pleasure. Like its colon-free title, the film fucks up what seems to be the easiest thing in the world. If I had a kid who loved dinosaurs and who I hated, I would take them to see Jurassic World Dominion, because it makes dinosaurs so deeply uncool. In its zeitgeisty quest to unite the Jurassic generations, optimizing its IP-per-second usage, it becomes a product created by its own corporate villain. The Jurassic stories have always been Frankenstein riffs, where humans are punished for playing God. But Trevorrow brazenly engineers his own artless, profit-hungry, overstuffed monstrosity, his thoughtless hubris free to walk the earth as a misshapen, soulless slight against its source.

-[Jacob Oller, Paste Magazine](https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/jurassic-world-dominion-review/): 3.5/10

> Colin Trevorrow returns to the director’s chair for the finale of the Jurassic World trilogy, and he seems to have learned nothing — not from the failures and many glaring and legitimate criticisms of the first two, much less from the narrative arc that began with Jurassic Park. Consequently, long-abused fans of the franchise are treated to a meandering retread of the earlier installments’ greatest hits, along with a handful of Spielberg homages peppered in as a vivid reminder of exactly who Trevorrow isn’t as a filmmaker. Meanwhile, the casts of both trilogies unite here to rectify the same lessons about science-run-amuck and indefatigable corporate greed that kickstarted the series back in 1993.

> Even though you'll recognize many of those moments, feelings of nostalgia won't be as forthcoming as a sense of box-ticking. The dutifulness is made worse by some unnecessarily junked-up action scenes, underlit and overhashed by editing. A black-market chase in Malta gives Trevorrow the opportunity to restage that jump-through-the-window moment from The Bourne Ultimatum — did you ever want to see a digitized raptor execute the stunt instead of Matt Damon?

-[Joshua Rothkopf, Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movies/movie-reviews/jurassic-world-dominion-review/): C-

> There's something unfortunately symbolic about ""Jurassic World: Dominion,"" which combines old and new DNA from the near-three-decade-old franchise and generates a pretty mindless mess. The nostalgia factor gives the movie an initial jolt, and there are, of course, some dino-sized thrills, but not enough to lift this XL-sized mediocrity out of the gene pool's shallow end.

-[Brian Lowry, CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/08/entertainment/jurassic-world-dominion-review/index.html)

> Jurassic World: Dominion is at best distracted, at worst boring. Playing on the nostalgic return of key heroes and frantically attempting Spielbergian wonder, it wants you to believe it’s got a back-to-basics understanding of Jurassic Park. Instead its convoluted notions of big entertainment ignore what Spielberg understood: dinosaurs have always had a natural hold on our collective imagination. Making them fun doesn’t have to be this hard.

-[Conor O'Donnell, The Film Stage](https://thefilmstage.com/jurassic-world-dominion-review-wrings-no-thrills-or-pleasure-from-tired-franchise/): D

> It’s a franchise that has been inadvertently acknowledging the waning thrill of watching giant CG prehistoric beasties smashing each other by constantly providing bigger, meaner, more genetically modified dinos to savour – much in the manner of, well, its own villains – when plot, characterisation and tension are what we have been really missing. Either way, it’s definitely time to let the dinosaurs enjoy a well-earned extinction.

-[Phil de Semlyen, Time Out](https://www.timeout.com/movies/jurassic-world-dominion-2022): 1/5

> This series' sixth film has a daft plot, groans with lousy action and makes the poor old dinosaurs humiliatingly surplus to requirements

-[Robbie Collin, The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/jurassic-world-dominion-review-franchises-credibility-finally/): 1/5

> Within laboratories, exposition is mercilessly dumped on the audience’s ears. Outside of them, villains slink about like refugees from a low-rent Bond parody, and this before one of them at once laughably and perfectly uses a laser pointer to steer a raptor in Owen’s direction. Which raises the question: Why doesn’t everyone in this neo-Jurassic Age have a laser pointer? Because short of handing the reins back to Spielberg, a feature-length Jurassic Cat World is the only evolution that can rejuvenate a franchise long past its sell-by date.
