The line between inspiration and plagiarism.,Illusioneer,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/15u57yx/the_line_between_inspiration_and_plagiarism/,7,8,"I’ll cut right to the chase

Got massively inspired by the story told through the songs of a certain metal band and started a novel based on it.

Characters and locations inspired by the source have different names. (though some are similar,) all the detailing, character personalities, backstories, world building and dialogue are my own. I’m not writing anything that resembles their lyrics and I’m also going in a different concluding narrative direction than the source. I’m also not competing with the inspirational source since it’s a music band with no already published written material based on their work.

However, recognisable major events that correlates with the lore of their songs still occur in order.

My initial desire was to write the book as a respectful and fun nod to their work and to capture the tones and themes that they established to appeal to my fellow fans.

But as I worked on it, I began to question the ethics (and possible consequences) of publishing something that can be recognised as being based on someone else’s narrative.


What’s the line here and how do I know if I’ve crossed it?

EDIT: 

I fully intend to credit the band in a foreword.

To make clear what the exact similarities are, I give the following description:

I’m using the major story beats as described in a musical album as a rough skeleton. I’m detailing out each event in my own words and adding a lot of detail and extra beats than what exists in the source. Some events unfold very differently than the source material. The conclusion to the narrative is very different from the source as well.

Certain character’s roles and goals in the narrative are directly based on the characters of the source, but names and backstories a different. Their personalities and exact actions and dialogue are detailed by me without referring to the source.

The objective was to adapt and expand the source material in a respectful manner. I’m not directly copying anything of theirs word for word and as stated there is a lot of added detail. Their songs only describes bits and pieces of the major events that corresponds to my book’s plot."
