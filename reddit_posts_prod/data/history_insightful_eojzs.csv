",ninjamiker,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/eojzs/is_anyone_here_good_with_latin_american_historyi/,5,0,"which period (pre 1930 or post 1930) was more critical for the making of Latin America?

""from the end of the fifteenth century, world history unquestionable became eurocentric and remained until the 20th century.  and elsewhere ""that the forces that transformed the world since the 15th century were.. European, is patent."" How accurate are these statements in the context of Latin's America's 19th and 20th century history?

A distinguished historian of Latin America once made a clain that the Cuban revolution of the late 1950's was a mere ""backyard scuffle"" when compared to the Mexican revolution of 1910-1920. Do you agree? Disagree? Please discuss both periods of revolution violence and post revolutionary violence transformations of Mexican and Cuban society.

and last one is about the quote, ""Poor Mexico, so far from God, so close to the United States"" What might this one liner mean? How relevant, apt, or appropriate is it in the larger historical context of the US-Latin American relations in the 19th and 20th century history?  

anything you think I should talk about or should mention would be greatly appreciated.  I have ideas already but I want to make sure I have it all because I want to do really well on the exam.  Thank you reddit, I love you all.  "
