"A question about computer simulations, death and human memory.",blackhole_enigma,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/14psnp/a_question_about_computer_simulations_death_and/,6,10,"Ive never visited this subreddit before but a question thats been bothering led me to look for it.

I was reading an article about how some scientists think that it may not be unlikely that we live in a computer simulation (and that some day we may be able to test if we are).

But lets say that we do live in one.

If all this is just a simulation being run on a computer, then obviously you'd question whether we are ""real"", and what it means to be real.

But then I thought about this some more, and it led me to another question.

Our brains are basically computers right? Obviously they are much more complex than the computers we own, but they are very similar and work on the same principles. So when we think of a memory or loved one, what we're really doing is running a simulation in our heads of that event or person, right? Neurons are firing to create the image and sounds that we hear in our mind, not unlike how a computer would process electrical input and code to run a program. So wouldnt that mean that we're each running our own little simulations inside our heads whenever we think about things? When we contemplate all possible outcomes of an event, or how a person may react in a certain situation, based on what we know of them, arent these all examples of simulations that we are creating in our brains?

So if our reality is really a simulation, what makes us anymore ""real"" than the thoughts in our own head? Arent they just simulations too?

Does anyone ever really die? If this is a simulation, and someone I love dies, but I remember and think of them in my mind, which simulation is really them? The one that was ""alive"" on my plane of existence or the one I have created in my mind? Is one simulation ""more real"" than another? 

Im bad at explaining this. This may be a very amateur thought, but if it is, I'd love to read more about this.
Thanks."
