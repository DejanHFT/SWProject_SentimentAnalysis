"Is there a literary works version of ""IMDB""?",Unforeseen_blind,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ydyork/is_there_a_literary_works_version_of_imdb/,38,61,"I don't know if my question is relevant to this subreddit, but anyway... Let's go !

I got back into reading in 2020, and I love it. So much so that I wondered how I managed to go without for so long. The problem is that I have little knowledge of the subject, and I can't put my finger on what I like about the books I like.

With movies, for example, I can refine my research on IMDB, or even read anecdotes, or behind-the-scenes secrets, which makes me enjoy the experience even more.

So I was wondering if there was a similar platform for literary works."
