What to apply before and after acrylic paint for metal look?,lucifersid,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/185y4we/what_to_apply_before_and_after_acrylic_paint_for/,0,1,"I made cardboard katana and then applied paper mache. After that spackle and sanded for smooth finish. Now I want to have metal like look for the blade. Should I apply primer? If yes, then which one. Or should I apply layer of white glue and after that acrylic paint? Or should I apply varnish in the last step? I need help with the order of products I have to use to achieve the best look for the katana.
I will only use acrylic paint with brush. So no flexibility in that step."
