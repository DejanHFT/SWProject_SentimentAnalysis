How does Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) work?,ZAKagan,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/22vgew/how_does_surface_plasmon_resonance_spr_work/,2,2,"I was reading [this phys.org article](http://phys.org/news/2014-04-ersb-nanostructures-applications-infrared-terahertz.html) and it sent me on a long wikipedia walk reading about surface plasmons and related materials.

Then, after some googling, I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM-VI3alvAI). In the video, it is mentioned that reactions that take place on the ligands result in a shift in the dark spot on the detector.

The narrator says that the resonance at the surface is very sensitive to environmental changes, but I don't fully follow. How and why does binding to the ligand cause this shift in angle? How is it connected to to the plasmonic resonance at the material's surface? 

EDIT: I realize that my question is more about the application of SPR in biochemistry than actually what the phenomena is. "
