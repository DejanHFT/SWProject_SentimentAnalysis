How to take inspiration without it feeling like a copy?,Phantom-Guardian,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/17pl1sf/how_to_take_inspiration_without_it_feeling_like_a/,3,2,"Over two years ago, I wrote a short summary of ideas for a rewrite of a TV show that I loved, but that went downhill in the second (and last) season to the point that it retroactively ruined the first season for me. I recently went back and reread my rewrite ideas, and I started to feel inspired to turn my rewrite into my own story, because I am pretty proud of the ideas I came up with still.

Due to it being a rewrite originally, I feel like it's going to be difficult to fully separate it from the material that inspired it. Does anyone have any advice for ways I can make it more original?"
