How do I broaden my creative thinking in terms of content creation?,benboy2197,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/smt5sn/how_do_i_broaden_my_creative_thinking_in_terms_of/,6,3,"I have been working at a company as a Creative Designer for digital media, I've probably worked on 1000+ creatives in the past few years. So much so that when I go to create something for my own interest or as a freelance project, my content somehow looks like it was made for my companies application. Somehow I end up with the same theme/framework for whatever I make. What sort of exercise or practice could someone suggest to broaden my creative capability and break the mould?"
