[Denver Post 3/4](https://www.denverpost.com/2021/08/23/marvel-shang-chi-legend-of-ten-rings-review/)
>It's a refreshing lift for this next phase of Marvel's world domination. You leave genuinely wanting to see more of Shang-Chi, even as we know we'll be meeting him again very soon.

[AV Club B-]( https://www.avclub.com/eastern-action-meets-western-superhero-formula-in-marve-1847532986)
>The first half of the movie is funnier and more down-to-earth than its second, which transitions from modern action to mythical fantasy with an emphasis on Chinese folklore-some actual, some imagined.  

[Observer 2.5/4](https://observer.com/2021/08/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings-review/)
>Shang-Chi certainly deserves credit as a groundbreaking step of representation in mega-budget filmmaking. You just desperately wish that the terrain it treads upon didn't feel so safe.

[Washington Post 3/4](https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings-movie-review/2021/08/20/6083ca02-00f7-11ec-a664-4f6de3e17ff0_story.html)
>It remembers to have fun. It's a kick to watch - often literally - and the kind of popcorn movie summer is made for.

[Empire Magazine 4/5](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings/)
>Despite pacing issues, it delivers a hugely entertaining step in the right direction for Asian representation.

[Time Out 4/5](https://www.timeout.com/movies/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings-2021)
>Even though it doesn't stick the landing, Shang-Chi is one of the better Marvel intros. Thor and Captain America both debuted in films less assured than this, and look how they developed.

[Daily Telegraph 4/5](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/shang-chi-legend-ten-rings-review-love-first-fight-new-marvel/)
>It's Marvel doing what Marvel does, but getting almost everything right this time - and that's rare.

[SF Chronicle 3/4](https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/movies-tv/review-shang-chi-and-its-s-f-bus-chase-make-good-transfer-to-marvel-universe)
>At some point during one of the best car chase scenes in San Francisco movie history, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" makes at least one thing gloriously clear: Today, you will be getting your money's worth at the movies.

[Entertainment Weekly B+](https://ew.com/movies/movie-reviews/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings-review/)
>A Technicolor whirlwind of a film whose explosive fight choreography and dense mythology are leavened by a sweet and surprisingly nimble script.

[The Wrap, fresh](https://www.thewrap.com/shang-chi-film-review-simu-liu-tony-leung-mcu/)
>Ventures in a new direction, building on the world that has become common moviegoer knowledge, but adding stylistic flourishes and an unhurried pace from Cretton that suggests it's content to be its own story instead of a cog in a larger machine.  

[USA Today 3/4](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/08/23/shang-chi-and-legend-ten-rings-review-simu-liu-rules/8214387002/?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&utm_campaign=usatodaycommovies-topstories)
>Liu... is simply a joy to watch. He's the MCU's most significant and infectious rookie since the late Chadwick Boseman with the same face-of-the-franchise appeal as Chris Evans.

[Hollywood Reporter, fresh](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings-review-1235000054/)
>While its disparate elements don't meld together as smoothly as they should, they do, in the end, add up to a superhero movie fresh and fun enough to feel worth a spin.

[Slant Magazine 1.5/4](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings-review-marvel/)
>On the screen, Shang-Chi is rotely defined by the same ""gifted kid"" impostor syndrome as so many other self-doubting MCU heroes before him.

[Guardian 3/5](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/aug/23/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings-review-marvel-simu-liu-awkwafina?CMP=twt_a-culture_b-gdnculture)
>It's an entertaining romp, although the formulaic quality is becoming a little obvious.

[The Atlantic, fresh](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/08/shang-chi-legend-ten-rings-marvel-review/619867/)
>Shang-Chi ultimately belongs to Leung. He's not just the star of the film's opening -- in his hands, Wenwu's devastation catalyzes the action and permeates every frame, turning the film into a tragedy.
