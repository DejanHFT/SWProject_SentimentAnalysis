What is your favorite historical word origins stories.,tj24mcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2zgpyp/what_is_your_favorite_historical_word_origins/,737,918,"What is your favorite historical origin story on how a word came to be. My favorites are as follows:

*  The term **sideburns** came from the American Civil War. General Ambrose Burnside had an unusual style of facial hair (what we call sideburns today).

*  The next one there has been some debate and it looks to have other origins but I still like the story is **hooker**. Who knows maybe the term was popularized by this story. During the American Civil War there was a General called ""Fighting Joe"" Hooker. It wasn't uncommon at the time for an army to be followed by a contingent camp to help out the armies. Some of these followers included prostitutes. General Hooker was very lenient with the prostitutes and allowing them in the army camps. The prostitutes started being referred to as Hooker's Girls. Eventually the girls was dropped and they were just called Hookers.
