A guide to reading the bible for literary pleasure?,Kukikokikokuko,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/en80a8/a_guide_to_reading_the_bible_for_literary_pleasure/,58,133,"**TLDR; For literary purposes, what parts of the bible should I read, and what translation? **



I’m not a Christian nor am I looking to become one, but I have decided I want to read the bible (or at least, some of it). 



This book is referenced in an astounding amount of literature and art, and I often feel as if I am missing a big chunk of culture by not having read it. Recently I read “the master and Margarita”, and felt very much that my biblical knowledge was lacking, and I very much would like to understand the biblical references in books such as Narnia, Ulysses, Harry Potter and so on. 



The thing is, most bible reading guides I have found online are for Christians that want to study the bible. I just want to read it as one would read a novel. I already have the Jerusalem Bible (in French) in my possession, but the thing  is more than 2000 page long written in small script. I don’t know if I have the patience to tackle all of it. Also, apparently the King James Version is the most influential English translation, so I might need to pick that up too. 

Any help? Thanks in advance."
