What is the deadliest infectious disease in human history?,Saida4,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/p3jv91/what_is_the_deadliest_infectious_disease_in_human/,931,2245,"I am trying to find the answer to this online and it is surprisingly difficult. I don't mean the deadliest pandemic/epidemic, so something that lasted for a specific set of years, such as a bubonic plague or the Spanish flu etc. I'm referring to infectious diseases throughout all of human history and their total death tolls. Basically ""what single thing has accumulated the highest number of human deaths across all of recorded history - and by how much?""

In my searching it seems the most likely candidate would either be Tuberculosis or Smallpox? What about Malaria, or Influenza? I'm not sure. Total Smallpox deaths throughout the past few centuries could be north of half a billion, as 300-500 million deaths are estimated between late 19th century and when it was eradicated late 20th. As for TB, which has been around for tens of thousands of years, the numbers are even more difficult to accurately discover it seems.

Do we even know what the deadliest disease throughout human history has been? And how many deaths its caused over the course of modern humanity? (10,000 BC or so).

Side question, is there a disease among animals that dwarfs the death rate of a human disease?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: rip my inbox, wow, thanks for the awards too! I've tried to read most of the comments and I cant reply to everyone but it seems like Malaria is the answer. I see people saying its responsible for 50% of all human deaths ever, something like 54 billion. I also see people saying that number and that story is an unsourced myth with virtually no evidence and the real number is more like 5%, but that would still leave Malaria as the answer. I didn't expect to get such a big response, thanks everybody."
