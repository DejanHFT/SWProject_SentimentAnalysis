Achievement Unlocked: Squat Bodyweight For Reps,Noexit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/dt3a9/achievement_unlocked_squat_bodyweight_for_reps/,23,14,"Tonight I reached my first real, defined strength training goal. I weighed in at 243, and I worked 3 sets for 5 reps each at 245. A meager accomplishment in light of my total bodyweight, but I feel pretty good about it. I still have a long way to go on the other lifts like bench and overhead press but I've proved myself capable of getting somewhere anyway. 

And a question, as my overall goal is to get rid of a bunch of extra fat weight my plan is to continue slowly progressing on all my lifts and continue to fight the kitchen; or should I slow up on the progress altogether, hold what I've got and really crunch the calories? The first option seems the obvious choice but I feel right now that I'm working at the limits of what my diet will allow. "
