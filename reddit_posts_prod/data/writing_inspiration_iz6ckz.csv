"Does anyone jot down words or phrases you really like while reading other people's work? If so, where and how do you keep your list of inspirational writing ideas organized?",OkTwist5554,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/iz6ckz/does_anyone_jot_down_words_or_phrases_you_really/,128,1456,"I want to improve my descriptive writing skills, so I am reading a lot more, hoping to absorb new words and phrases that I can use in my writing. I'd like to know if anyone else does this, and does it help in the long run?

  
Edit: WOW! I was not expecting all of these replies. All of you who responded have given me some great and useful ways to get my notes organized, and I am much more confident that my writing will improve over time. For those wondering, I have created a new spreadsheet on Google Docs and will continuously be adding words, phrases, figures of speech, etc. that I find during my readings. I believe that this will not only motivate me to read more but also make my writing livelier over time.

  
So thanks again [/r/writing](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing)! You're the best!"
