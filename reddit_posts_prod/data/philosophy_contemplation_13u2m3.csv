Major philosophers who did take their own life?,UltimatePhilosopher,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/13u2m3/major_philosophers_who_did_take_their_own_life/,24,13,"Aside from Socrates, who was sentenced to death by hemlock (or Jesus, sentenced to death by crucifixion even though on some accounts he presumably was free to miracle himself out of the situation), are there any major philosophers in history who did commit suicide or seriously contemplate it?  I can't think of any.*  Of the major names, I wonder if Schopenhauer's philosophy is the most depressive of the bunch; I haven't given it close study.  I would think that rates of suicide among philosophers are considerably lower than among the population as a whole; why would this be so?

[*] - (A philosophy prof. I knew - but not a widely-known philosopher otherwise - did take his own life in middle age. :-(  I don't know the explanation he gave in the suicide letter he reportedly left, either.)"
