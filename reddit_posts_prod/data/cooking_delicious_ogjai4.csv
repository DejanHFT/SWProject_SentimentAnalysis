"Made a delicious blend, would recommend",terrillable,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/ogjai4/made_a_delicious_blend_would_recommend/,93,870,"So I found myself with far too much Thai basil and Thai chilis. Not knowing exactly what to do with it all, I decided to make a spicy sauce to top dishes with. 

I started with a frying few cloves of garlic minced in olive and coconut oil. Then added about half a pound of minced chilis until they softened up, then added the basil. 

I tasted it, 7/10 on the spicy scale, but thought it needed something.  I had a lemon sitting around so I added some zest and squeezed the juice into it. 

Oh. My. Goodness! It goes incredibly on curries, eggs, I fried some squash with it and YUM. Thought Iâ€™d share!

Happy cooking!"
