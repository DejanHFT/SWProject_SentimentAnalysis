Why have we not seemingly seen advances in audio technology to the extent we have seen advances in visual technology?,btxtsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/16q4pe/why_have_we_not_seemingly_seen_advances_in_audio/,6,2,"I'm writing this watching an LCD screen. Over 10million tiny LCs emitting light at me. And it cost around $200. This is amazing to me considering the development and prices of the first LCDs, CRTs before that, vaccuum tubes, film, etc.

At the same time, if I listen to sound, it comes out of a set of $800 speakers that work in effectively the same way as the first speakers of  over 100 years ago. The cone wobbles and puts out sound. It doesn't put out sound via plasma pulses or electrifying the air or anything i've just completely made up right now.

So why aren't good speakers cheap as chips? And why are there not amazingly improved ways of emitting sound for consumers other than vibrating the air with mechanical components?"
