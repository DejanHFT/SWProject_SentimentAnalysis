What are some fantasy novels with literary merit?,lyleboffin,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ebclno/what_are_some_fantasy_novels_with_literary_merit/,134,43,"In recent years I’ve found my reading trend toward literary fiction, yet said fiction is almost always set in a realistic setting. Growing up, fantasy novels were my absolute favorite yet I have trouble going back and reading some of my favorites because they’re generally not that well written.

For example, the wheel of time is heralded as one of the best series of the genre but I feel it has glaring issues with pacing and characterization (specifically of women)

Many of the other books I’ve read are parts of series that are offshoots of the dungeons and dragons universe which is really hit or miss.

What options are out there for fantasy literature? There has to be something with a little more meat I can sink my teeth into."
