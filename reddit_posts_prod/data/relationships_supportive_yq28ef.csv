I’m Having a hard time being a supportive boyfriend 26M,Henrehmarsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/yq28ef/im_having_a_hard_time_being_a_supportive/,1,1,"My 23 year old girlfriend’s parents are getting a divorce and it is affecting her, my parents got divorced when I was just 10 and it was very traumatic, so I completely understand how she feels. I am a very empathetic person but my partner, she behaves unreasonably and gets annoyed and angry over silly things when I am trying to help her which just causes a bad reaction from me and so I argue in response because I can’t relate to that kind of behaviour, if I am low and someone is trying to help me, I’m passive, appreciative and grateful even if it’s not the kind of help I need I can least recognise someone’s trying. Whereas my partner will get pissed off with me if in my effort to help and relieve stress, and be empathetic I do something that comes from a good place but she takes it the wrong way she gets annoyed with me and so Im struggling to keep my empathy and be what she needs right now. Any advice? For example she needed to practise what she needs to say over the phone at her new job to me before work tomorrow, I could tell she was struggling, we were both tired I was struggling to stay awake so i said as kindly as possible would you like to get up early and go through this tomorrow, she took it the wrong way said why am I so demotivating I know she needed to go through this and stormed off telling me how rubbish of a boyfriend I am… I feel like I can’t say or do anything right for her 


TL;DR! 23F partner going through a rough time and I 26M seem to be making things worse."
