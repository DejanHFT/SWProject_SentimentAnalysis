The ways we learn.,TheRealWorstGamer,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/12hqtz3/the_ways_we_learn/,7,6,"Hello all, I wanted to ask everyones option on a specific topic that interest me. 

I have found recently that much of the youth (I included) gravitate towards educational videos rather than books. In your experience do you get more out of a educational videos or tutorial or do you get more out of reading about the topic and doing examples presented in the books? Please let me know your reasoning when choosing how to absorb the information you are interested in."
