"Achieving smooth paint surface, what grit sandpaper between paint layers?",gazeebo88,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/36ny55/achieving_smooth_paint_surface_what_grit/,9,5,"I made a bench for our house and I am going to paint it a simple white. I'll be using Shellac if that makes a difference because I don't trust latex with 3 cats in the house that have paint destroying claws.

I would like to achieve an as smooth as possible finish, partially because it would look neat and partially for the experience.

I have read that in between the layers of paint I should sand with 180-220 grit sandpaper and the final layer(s) with ~400 grit sandpaper.

Could anyone give me some advice on how to achieve a very smooth paint surface?"
