"""The Hunt"" (2012) is kind of the anti-""Festen"" (1998): Mass Hysteria happens which leads to a social critique about what instigates a mob",Lili_Danube,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/wnm6ic/the_hunt_2012_is_kind_of_the_antifesten_1998_mass/,6,13,"In ""Festen"", the family reacts violently when the son exposes the father's abuse. They beat and subsequently try to isolate the son, we're horrified by their reaction (especially the racist brother), until they can't avoid the truth any longer. The father is a monster, zero remorse.

In ""The Hunt"", the opposite happens, the community want to expose an abuse which doesn't exist, they're dominated by the hysteria, anger and even, bullying. Instead of trying to find the truth, they choose to believe the worst.

I enjoyed ""The Hunt"", however its uncomfortable narrative does make it into a difficult film to watch. I wouldn't watch it again. Once was enough."
