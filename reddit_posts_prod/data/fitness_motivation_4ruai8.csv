Loosing Motivation again. 2 weeks no workout,sydalmighty,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4ruai8/loosing_motivation_again_2_weeks_no_workout/,25,0,"It has been two weeks that I skipped working out.
Before posting here, I wouldn't admit to myself that I'm loosing motivation because I wanna get bigger and stronger sooner rather than later and it is not happening in the pace that I want it to be. No excuses, I don't eat more, and I don't workout hard enough. Even though I did, still the progress is slow. Maybe I am jealous with other guys but then it is another excuse for me.

Sorry guys for ranting. I just don't know where to release this frustration. None of my current group of friends are working out so they won't understand me if I tell them things like this.

How do you do it? How do you keep pushing on?"
