"Historians, pick three books from your specialities for a beginner in the topic, three for a veteran and three for an expert.",aokaga,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/84dqir/historians_pick_three_books_from_your/,924,5646,"Hello! I saw this a while ago on /r/suggestmeabook and then again a couple of hours ago on /r/books and I thought this may be super cool in this subreddit. (I suggest you check both threads! Awesome suggestions)

Historians, what is your speciality and which books would you recommend for an overall understanding? Can be any topic (Nazi Germany, History of Islam, anything and everything) Any expert that isn't necessarily a historian is also welcome to contribute suggestions :) 

Particularly, I'd love to hear some books on African, Russian and Asian (mostly South) history!

Edit to add: thanks a lot for the contribution people. So many interesting threads and subjects. I want to add that some have replied to this thread with topics they're interested on hoping some expert can appear and share some insight. Please check the new comments! Maybe you can find something you can contribute to. I've seen people ask about the history of games, to more insight into the Enlightenment, to the history of education itself. Every knowledge is awesome so please, help if you can! 

Edit #2: I'm going to start adding the specific topics people are asking for, hoping it can help visibility! Let me know if you want me to add the name of the user, if it helps, too. I can try linking the actual comment but later today as it's difficult in Mobile. I will update as they come, and as they're resolved as well! 

(Topics without hyperlinks are still only requests. Will put a link on the actual question so it can be answered easily tomorrow maybe, for now this is a lists of the topics on this thread so far and the links for the ones that have been answered already)

Edit #3: Gold! Oh my gosh, thank you so much kind anonymous. There are so many other posts and comments who deserved this yet you chose to give it to me. I'm very thankful. 

That being said! I'm going to start updating the list again. So many new topic requests have been asked, so many already answered. I'm also going to do a list of the topics that have already been covered-- as someone said, this may be helpful for someone in the future! Bear with me. It's late and I have to wake up early tomorrow for class, but I'll try to do as much as I can today! Keep it coming guys, let's share knowledge! 

Edit #4: I want to also take the opportunity to bring attention to the amazing people at /r/AskHistorians, who not only reply to questions like this every day, they have in their sidebar a [lot of books and resources in many topics](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books). Not exactly divided in these three options, but you can look up if they're appropriate for your level of understanding, but it's a valuable resource anyway. You may find what you're looking for there. Some of the topics that people haven't answered, either, can be found there! "
