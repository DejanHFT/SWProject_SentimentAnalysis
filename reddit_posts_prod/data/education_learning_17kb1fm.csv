Is there any data out there that shows posting learning objectives improves literacy?,ICUP01,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/17kb1fm/is_there_any_data_out_there_that_shows_posting/,11,12,"I can find data that it doesnâ€™t. Or that students will achieve the objective but cannot think beyond the actual standard, ie combine the standards together for a larger picture. 

Given as pervasive posting objectives are, it feels like a pseudo practice like tapping into learning styles."
