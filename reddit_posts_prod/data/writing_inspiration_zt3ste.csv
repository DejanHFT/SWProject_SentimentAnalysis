Inspiration to keep writing dwindles,TheMechXYZ,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/zt3ste/inspiration_to_keep_writing_dwindles/,2,0,"Never thought I'd get here but this is my feeling for this entire year. Last year I finished a story I've worked on for a decade called Total Calamity Robot. Action Sci Fi. I put up years of money for cool book cover art and have over 12 books submitted to Kindle... And it's dead in the water til this day. Although the manuscript is finished, I'd consider it 90% finished becuase I have 6 more books to publish with a front cover to consider it 100% complete.

Time goes on and I find inspiration to write a new story that's inspired by power rangers/ Super Sentai called Wing Ace V. Has a mature feeling to it. I published the first volume, but then I get in despair.

I managed to get book cover artwork for volume 2 and 3, and then just stop becuase I'm trying to honestly find a way to get eyes on my novels. I always looked at tips on how to catch a reader's eye, and I strongly felt an awesome cover would do the trick. Additional artwork of characters for readers to see if interested. I did it all, and get no luck. My brain runs with ideas all the time for Wing Ace V, becuase tokusatsu is something that I've enjoyed since a child and still enjoy today. Days go by where I say yes, let's just push this and do it. Then another I ponder if I wasted all that money into my work for nothing. I feel like it goes unnoticed. I feel like at worst, there's no point.

I want Wing Ace V to have about 10 books(98 chapters total) , with 2 more sequels(10-12 chapters a piece). I wrote the chapter summaries from up to 60 which is a major climax to the story. I stopped there at the time to try and write them all out. I already have character art for the important main heroes and their suits. I know what I want from beginning to end story wise. I'm just having a real hard time wanting to continue becuase I'm just not getting ANY feedback from my work. Positive or negative. It's like it's lost at sea never to be seen. At this point of my life I'm thinking of either going to a different publishing company besides Kindle to get luck, maybe do some one shot comics of my novels since my true dream is to have them animated/ drawn in a comic. If nothing else, probably take a long hiatus or just quit for good.

But I come to you guys. What would you say to someone who found a passion for writing since a freshman in high school becuase he couldn't draw well to let his creetive thoughts out, and is now 27 contemplating if any of it all was worth the time after all the years and money put into it. I need some advice/ encouraging words to push me to continue honestly. I'm starting to be at my wits end. I know I have the drive but I hate seeing my book on those KDP reports and see 0 across the board. I understand sales isn't the driving factor, but for no one to see it at all? Idk. Maybe I can convert to just one short story book. Nice and sweet. Possibly 10-12 long chapters. However that's very tough becuase I love long stories. Idk guys. What do you think?

TL;DR: I have over 12 books published of a long running series, and 1 book published of a new story(money put into character artwork+ book cover artwork), and im starting to feel like I wasted my time. Despite me still being passionate about writing, I'm not getting any sort of feedback after publishing them(via Kindle), and it's starting to put me in despair to a point that I either don't want to write anymore, or just take another yearly hiatus."
