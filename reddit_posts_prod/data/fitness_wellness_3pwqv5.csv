Public Speaking Class - Presentation on Health and Wellness - Help,Fryeboy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3pwqv5/public_speaking_class_presentation_on_health_and/,2,1,"Hello wonderful people of /r/fitness!

I am currently enrolled in a public speaking class and in 2 weeks I will be giving a presentation on general fitness. The speech is supposed to be in the form of a persuasive speech and will last 6-7 minutes. I will be persuading my class to become more active, eat right, and improve their lifestyles. 

My plan was to begin with discussing some of the negatives that come along with being over weight (Diabetes, high blood pressure, organ failure). I would then transfer to the benefits that come along with being healthy. I was planning on then talking about not only the physical health, but also the psychological health that comes with transforming your life style. I would love to talk to someone who has had personal experience with changing their way of life to being fit and find out what sort of effects it has had on them. Also, if any of you could suggest some other topics that I could throw in such as home workouts/effects of working out before bed/proper diets, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you for taking the time to read this!"
