What are some unconventional places that inspire you to write?,fennelliott,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/17ern2c/what_are_some_unconventional_places_that_inspire/,14,3,"I have a strange tendency for wanting to write whenever I visit the hospital. My mom needs someone to drive her there and back for her bi-weekly meetings and just waiting in the lobby for her to finish gives me a desire to work on my short story anthology. It's not out of boredom, though there are things I'd rather be doing than just waiting around. It's a feeling of quiet busyness that resonates with me in such creative way, I feel like I've developed a Pavlovian response to hand sanitizer, bleach, and unanswered phone calls at the front desk. I spoke to my sister, who writes poetry, about her unconventional place of inspiration and she said the Post-Office because fresh print paper reminds her of Barnes and Noble. Out of curiosity, does anyone else have an unconventional spot which gets them in a mood for writing?"
