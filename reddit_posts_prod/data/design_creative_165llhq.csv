Creative Process + Workflow tips?,command_z_,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/165llhq/creative_process_workflow_tips/,5,5,"Hey everyone,

I'm trying to get better at speeding up my workflow and creative thought process (particularly during the ideation phase of projects). Would anyone happen to have any tips or techniques for quickly churning out potential directions prior to a creative review? (I have the shortcuts and technical side down... It's more the strategic aspect I am curious about).

Thanks!"
