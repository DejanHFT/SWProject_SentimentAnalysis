"Without going to college, (already been) how can I learn to write?",Internal-Ad-2546,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/15yl9dw/without_going_to_college_already_been_how_can_i/,11,9,"I will try to keep this brief. I got my bachelor's degree eons ago and long story short, I should have waited because I have changed so much. I am physically disabled as well as have some slight cognitive disabilities and have a lot of spare time.  I have been self-teaching myself math through Khan, studying French through Duolingo, and reading books on history and science etc. The more finite subjects are easy to teach yourself because there is a definite right or wrong answer and there are videos showing you how to do it, or, at the very least, you are memorizing info and regurgitating it. However, writing is more difficult because there isn't a right and wrong answer beyond making sure everything is spelled and punctuated correctly.  How do you differentiate between what is poor, satisfactory, good, or genius level? I can't use a site like K12 or something because you have to be a child and prove it, but I wish there was a way to ""do school"" again.  My local community college has removed all their remedial classes, so that isn't an option, and I know, due to trying a class a while back, that I am not college material anymore. I know this sounds seriously messed up but if I could do anything I wished, I would morph into a 10 year old's body for instance, with the knowledge I have, and fine tune my education to make sure I have learned everything I should have. I miss being in school. I guess you could say I am going through my second childhood. This isn't for a job or anything, it is just my hobby. I don't know how you can be the student and the teacher with something like writing because if you know what you are doing wrong you wouldn't do it! "
