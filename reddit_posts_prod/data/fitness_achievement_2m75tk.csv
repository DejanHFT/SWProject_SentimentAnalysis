[Progress Report] 9 Month of SS are over. Here's what I achieved,yardeni,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2m75tk/progress_report_9_month_of_ss_are_over_heres_what/,171,279,"**Back story**

Hi everyone. I'm a 25 years old male. 1.76m. 

After suffering from lower back pain ever since the age of twelve, I decided around a year ago that it was time to take action. My doctor said the best thing I could do is swim, so I started HIIT swimming in a nearby country club. Around a month later, I started attending the gym there since it was included in the subscription. I was lucky to hear about [LeanGains](http://www.leangains.com/) before, but the scary instructor at that gym said Deadlifts are dangerous for noobs and there was no squat rack over there. And so I immediately started working out with the Smith machine, pull ups, weighted row machine, bench press and crunches (so only minor fuckarounditis?). Noob me figured it was the same thing. I finally felt I was working in the right direction though. I liked the idea of working my back and that it was sour from being worked rather than from deteriorating for no reason like usual. Then I discovered this great subreddit and after around a month I stopped attending that country club, moved to another gym, stopped swimming, and started seriously training on [StartingStrength](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:The_Program). 

At this point it was around March and I did not record my lifts. But I remember them vaguely.  



**Starting Stats and 5RM**

Weight: 83kg, 23% fat.     /192lb

* Deadlift - 60 kg                /132lb
* Squat - 50 kg                   /110lb
* OHP - 25 kg                     /55lb
* Bench press - 35 kg          /77lb
* Pull ups - 6,6,6

At this point I could pull up for 6 reps of 3 sets. Which was a great improvement on my 3 rep for 1 set originally.

Resets(5RMs): Squat - 115, 127.5. Deadlift - 145. Bench press - 70,75. OHP - 50,57. Clean - 75.

On 11/11/14 I stalled for the second time Squatting 127.5kg for 5 reps. I'm now doing an intensive reset on the squat, since this failure was progressively worse (5,5,2),(4,4,3),(3,3,2). Also I'm switching to the advance novice program.



**Stats and 5RM After 9 months**

 Weight: 87kg               /185lb

* Deadlift - 145 kg        /320lb
* Squat - 125 kg          /275lb
* OHP - 57.5 kg              /126lb
* Bench press - 82.5 kg   /180lb
* Clean - 72.5 kg             /160lb
* Pull ups - 13,10,7

The improvement I'm having on my back pain is nothing short of amazing. My life is changed :) It's not like I forgot I have a back, but it's much less frequent and much more tolerable to the point that it's no longer an issue. As you can imagine, it is extremely motivating for me to lift.

**Adherence to the program**

Like most beginners, I kept adding exercises at first, trying to target every muscle from every angle. However I got addicted to reading this sub and the more I read threads here, the more convinced I got that I should change my program to SS/SL. Since I loved clean and pressing, I naturally chose the SS program (since cleaning didn't scare me). Of course, 3X5 felt too little at first so I started at 5X5, which probably slowed my progress at some point. However as soon as I started Squatting 90 kg, I felt 5 sets were too much for me and it's a shame to slow my progress because of the extra sets. From there on it was strict 3X5 for me.

**Things I Did Right:**

* **Form** - I've watched pretty much any video I could get my hands on at first. I would watch them again before practice. Next, I read StartingStrength, the website, the SL website and anything else I could find and created a sheet with short & simple cues on how to get into position, where to look during the lift, how the movement should be performed and what to watch out for. I printed that sheet and took it with me to the gym to read before every lift. This is one of the best thing newbies without trainers can do for themselves IMO.
* **Cardio** - Well kind of. I started doing HIIT sprints early on the program. I do them whenever I get the chance. I sprint/walk for 15/45 seconds, so counting is easy. I did this 11 times (so 11 minutes) although now I can do it for 15. I think this kind of activity does not affect long term fatigue - at least for me.
* **Food** - Truth is I'm not sure how many calories I consumed. I didn't bulk or cut. I tracked my calories with Myfitness pal for a while and then stopped. I do make sure to eat around 180 grams of protein each day. When I did track, I consumed around 2000 calories on rest days and 2500 calories on workout days. I skip breakfast every day and this has proved to be my favorite dieting strategy. That, together with eating a shit ton of steamed veggies and 2-4 scoops of whey protein a day. On days that I sprint I add around 300 calories.
* **Micro loading** - My second gym was great in many ways, but the smallest olympic plates there were 2.5 each - so I progressed in 5kg steps for longer than I should have. Since it took some time to find a store with micro plates, I started bringing two 1.5L bottles of water. I had a bag for each bottle and I would hang them on each side of the bar. I had full control over the weight since I would sometimes fill them only 2/3 or 1/3, and surprisingly, nobody at the gym cared and barely anyone said anything. So consider it ;)


**Things I Should Have Done:**


* **Partners** - Sadly I've always trained alone. This could have been a bump in my motivation. I think one should actively seek partners for programs. Maybe go to meets?
* **Worked on my grip** - When I reached 145kg DL I just couldn't lift the weight anymore. I lifted the weight 5 times and ever since couldn't replicate that. My grip is weak now and I think I should have addressed this from the beginning. Do yourself a favor and do the [grip strength beginner routine](http://www.davidhorne-gripmaster.com/basics.html) from the beginning IMO.
* **Pictures** - I have only some random before pictures. Don't be shy and take them pictures!
* **Supplements** - Way too much emphasis and reading into it. Most important IMO are Omega3, Whey and Creatine. I did find taking [Citrulline Malate](http://examine.com/supplements/Citrulline/), drinking or taking some [Caffeine](http://examine.com/supplements/Caffeine/), and sometimes [Tyrosine](http://examine.com/supplements/L-Tyrosine/), before workouts, made a difference. IMO it brought a better chance for breaking plateaus.

**Is my life changed?**

Aside from my back pain almost gone? A little bit. I feel much stronger and ""able"". Walking, standing, sitting and getting up are easier now. I'm also much more flexible - which I didn't expect. I know how to lift things the right way. Also my new hobby and pastime is reading this sub. I am now considered ""big"" or ""a muscle man"" by other people. They can tell that I lift. I'm still not sure how to feel about that. Sometimes I don't want to be that guy but I think I'll get used to it or just learn to not care. At my current gym, which is the cheapest by far in my area, everyone is on their own fuckarounditis program. I feel like I want to tell every single person how great my progress is and that lifting weights and the right program can greatly improve in their lives. I stop myself though. I don't like being preached to and who even knows what's good for somebody else? If someone asks, I'll be pleased to share my experience. 


**What's next**

I can't leave things the way they are. I love progressing. Knowing I'm going to be stronger every day, it's another thing to look forward to.
I've started the advanced novice program today and after that I'm switching to the Texas method. I also read good things about [Juggernaut method](http://www.powerliftingtowin.com/the-juggernaut-method/) so I think that will be next, but there's still some time for that :)


**Pictures**
I didn't really come here for that but since there's some progress, I might as well share it. You can tell I don't stick to the HIIT lately but I'm still pretty proud of my progress.
NSFW & hairy guy :)

[Before](http://imgur.com/a/2n9Y8#0) - The first two are more recent.


[After](http://imgur.com/a/F0HEt#0) - Last picture is disproportionate.
The pictures aren't so good. While it's true I've always been a little big and never really weak, I do look different. One aspect though must be my posture. I don't have to worry about it too much anymore.

**Last but not least**
Thank you dear community. I attribute much of my progress to you. I've learned much from this sub. I value this place greatly. 

Edit:
Just wanted to point out I'm not really sure how strict my pull ups are. I'm not kipping but I do move my body. I guess I'll upload some videos of my lifts for form checking next week. 

Edit2:
Here's the sheet:
> **Squat**
> 
> * Start position: Thumb on top, Bar under shoulder bone, Heels shoulder width, toes pointing 30 degrees, eyes a few feet ahead on the floor.
> Bottom position: Knees only slightly after toes, keep a straight back and around 45 degress to the floor.
> * Movement: Breath at the top. Start the way down by sitting the hips back and knees forward (think about hips). Lead the way up with your bottom. Breath at the top or the end of the movement.
> 
> 
> **Bench Press**
> 
> * Start position: Feet straight on the floor. Keep your eyes at the ceiling at the same spot. Eyes under the bar holders. Arms to shoulders around 75 degrees do your torso (Not 90), Hands gripping the bar tightly, Bar rests in hand area close to the thumb. Bring your traps as close together as you can and your butt up on the bench towards your shoulders.
> * Bottom position: Bar touches the shirt above the middle pec.
> Movement: Breath at the top. Elbow under the bar and slightly down. Push with the chest and keep torso and abs tight. Breath at the top.
> 
> 
> **Over Head Press**
> 
> * Start position: Wrist under the bar, thumb slightly outside shoulder width. Back hand rests on chest (gets support from upper back). Bar rests in hand area close to the thumb. Keep back neutral. Take hips forward while squeezing the glutes, place the bar on the upper pecs.
> * Movement: Breath at the top. Push while moving the head forward. The bar should always be above the feet.
> 
> 
> **Deadlift**
> 
> * Start position: Grab bar from the part between the palm and the fingers, no extra skin. Feet bellow the bar pointing 10-30 degrees away. Heels slightly less than Squat width, like for a jump. The bar should be an inch from the foot. Hands take the bar so that the hands are close to the feet but thumbs don't touch the feet. Bend over with straight arms, when you can't go any further, add knee bend until you reach the bar. Now point hips until your knee and chest go past the bar, the bar should be under the traps. Bring your chest up and keep your eyes straight.
> * Movement: Breath at the bottom. Keep back straight with a slight arch. Push the ground with your feet. Go up with your hips and then push your pelvis forward and back backwards.
> 
> 
> **Clean**
> 
> * Start position: Deadlift with shoulder width grip.
> * Movement: Breath at the bottom. Go up until the knee and then explode, finishing with the bar on the chest. Elbow in 45 degree angle."
