Why is Starting Strength/Rippetoe so well regarded here?,AoE-Priest,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/z7nzb/why_is_starting_strengthrippetoe_so_well_regarded/,25,0,"I ask this out of genuine curiosity.  The FAQ tells me that this program is ridiculously more efficient than other programs for beginners. I want to know what the basis is for this attitude. Based on the AMA with Rippetoe he admits his work is not based on scientific trials but on anecdote, I can appreciate that because the literature is so damn sparse when it comes to weightlifting/bodybuilding. But what I want to know is why despite the absence of any objective evidence, SS is seen as almost as the bible for weightlifters around here.

Again this is not criticism but a genuine inquiry, also I want to know if for someone interesting more in mass/aesthetics than strength if this is a good program. Thank you all."
