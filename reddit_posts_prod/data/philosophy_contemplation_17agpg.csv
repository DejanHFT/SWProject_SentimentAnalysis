"I'm quite new to philosophy, but I love it. Can you suggest to me a reading progression to get to certain works?",bluebombed,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/17agpg/im_quite_new_to_philosophy_but_i_love_it_can_you/,12,10,"I'm finishing up the philosophy course offered at my school (which is quite reputed). We went through a lot of stuff but oftentimes it was just a review of theories. However, I saw it as a launching pad for further discussion and contemplation on my own and with friends. I enjoyed it so much that I'm doing some sort of philosophy program in university next year (either alone or with polisci/econ in a PPE program).

The textbook we used had a lot of primary references but we didn't actually read works because it was a 1-semester high school course. I've only read a little bit of Thus Spake Zarathustra for my summative unit (and most people didn't bother reading any primary material for that).

So, to the point, I'd like to read things on finding meaning in life and why life is worth it, because that issue is especially compelling to me right now. I'm quite interested in Camus, absurdism, and Nietzsche. I suppose I should read Frankl as well. Could you dudes give me some sort of reading list? As in, a list I can follow to give me an exposition to philosophy and then delve into the topics I mentioned previously (and other related ones), because I don't think I should start reading random works without context.

**tl;dr new to philosophy, what's some good intro to philosophy and other context before reading Camus and absurdism and etc.**

Thanks."
