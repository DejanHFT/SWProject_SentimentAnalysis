Hands on Learning - History Kits,pizzabun4,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/srtmiv/hands_on_learning_history_kits/,0,2,"I am a high school history teacher in Canada and I am looking to curate a collection of historical artifacts or objects to use in my class when exploring new historical topics. Object based learning helps engage my class and would love to tie this in to different units of each course. Does anyone know where I can find or order historical objects for the classroom that explores topics related to Canada's involvement in WWI, The 20s, 30s, and WWII? I also teach American history and would love to find artifacts for that class as well. I know that the Canadian War Museum offers discovery kits to borrow but I would like to curate items for my entire school to keep and use."
