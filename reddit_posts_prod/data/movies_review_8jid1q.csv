Written Reviews:

[Chicago Tribune - Michael Phillips](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-deadpool-2-rev-0514-story.html)

> *At its best, his flights of fancy here are crazily inspired, each swoop of physics-defying movement, every new leap from or to a speeding vehicle, delivered with twisted panache. The difference between what Leitch can do, and what director Matthew Vaughn favors in those cruddy “Kingsman” outings, for example, is the difference between violent action with a sense of humor and brutality, undisguised.* 

[Chicago Sun-Times - Richard Roeper](https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/deadpool-2-a-dark-gruesome-delight-from-start-to-very-funny-finish/)

> *A few of the movie parody jokes and pop music cues feel a little timeworn. We’ve seen satires on THAT particular film scene before and we’ve heard THAT particularly sappy ballad used to comedic effect before as well. But even the easier jokes are delivered with enthusiasm, and accompanied by creatively gruesome R-rated carnage.* 

[Collider - Matt Goldberg](http://collider.com/deadpool-2-review/)

> *It’s the kind of earnest storytelling that the rest of the movie would seem all-too-eager to mock. This gives Deadpool 2 a case of tonal whiplash where you’re laughing hysterically at the devil-may-care jokes only to have to pump the brakes and care about Deadpool’s emotional arc. And yet at the end, Deadpool 2 is similar to its predecessor in that you’ll have a blast while watching it and then almost immediately start to forget it.* 

[Empire - John Nugent](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/deadpool-2-2/review/)

> *It’s fair to say if you didn’t get on with the first film’s always-winking comedy and unheroic bloody violence, you probably won’t find much solace this time around, but if you’re on board for the ride, Deadpool 2 is more entertaining than ever. Plus, it remains a refreshing superheroic counterpoint to the likes of Avengers: Infinity War or Justice League — here, the only thing at stake is Wade Wilson’s sanity.* 

[Entertainment Weekly - Leah Greenblatt](http://ew.com/movies/2018/05/14/deadpool-2-review/)

> *There’s a numbing sameness to the casual bloodshed here that makes the viewer almost long for the relative calm of the first film’s lengthy pop culture digressions. It’s in Deadpool’s DNA to channel the wild id of a 12-year-old boy — a very clever one who happens to love boobs, Enya, and blowing stuff up. Which is dizzy fun for a while, like eating Twinkies on a Gravitron. Eventually, though, it just wears you out.* 

[Forbes - Scott Mendelson](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2018/05/14/review-ryan-reynolds-deadpool-2-box-office-fox-marvel/)

> *Deadpool 2 is indeed a better, sharper, more creative film than its flash-in-the-pan predecessor. Freed from the origin story box, this second installment of the Wade Wilson franchise has its cake and eats it took, taking any number of shots at the superhero sub-genre (and modern blockbuster filmmaking in general) while still crafting a story that makes sense on its own terms and works as a character piece. I do take umbrage with certain decisions (longtime readers can probably guess the part when I mentally threw a shoe at the screen), but the off-the-cuff screenplay and witty interplay did its work to win me back.* 


[The Guardian - Steve Rose](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/15/deadpool-2-review-ryan-reynolds-weapons-grade-gags-subversive)

> *What made the first Deadpool, and saves this one, is the way they mix emotional sincerity in with the meta-movie wisecracking. The comedy comes from a place of pain, and Ryan Reynolds’ ability to flip between both registers so effortlessly is a superpower few actors possess.* 

[The Hollywood Reporter - John DeFore](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/deadpool-2-review-1111085)

> *There's action aplenty throughout the film, but Deadpool 2 doesn't bog down in it as many overcooked comic-book sequels do. With Reynolds' charismatic irreverence at its core, the pic moves from bloody mayhem to lewd comedy and back fluidly, occasionally even making room to go warm and mushy. On the latter front, the filmmakers walk a fine line between embracing Deadpool's mock-everything appeal and needing to make Wade a credible, emotional human. Whenever it threatens briefly to slip into corniness, though, the movie regains its balance.* 

[IGN - Daniel Krupa](http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/15/deadpool-2-review-2)

> *Deadpool 2 eventually draws its disparate elements together, gains momentum, and pushes towards something more closely resembling a traditional finale. In keeping with the rest of the movie, it’s still fairly small-scale and character-focused, and surprisingly, it’s emotionally effective too. Despite the character’s trademark flippancy, there’s a real unexpected warmth to Deadpool 2. Not only does the sequel explore this flawed character, it firmly establishes him as a loveable and effective hero.* 

[Indiewire - Kate Erbland](http://www.indiewire.com/2018/05/deadpool-2-review-ryan-reynolds-sequel-1201963107/)

> *Like so many franchise-starting first films, “Deadpool” had to push through some necessary evils to get to the good stuff, fortunately, all that subversive goodness is on wild display in “Deadpool 2,” which delivers on the promise of the first film (and more).* 

[The New York Times - A.O. Scott](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/movies/deadpool-2-review-ryan-reynolds.html)

> *The script, by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and Ryan Reynolds (who once again plays the title character), is loaded with winky, fourth-wall-piercing eruptions of meta, the kind of humor that can make even the slow-witted and literal-minded feel devilishly clever. Works for me, I guess. But this sequel to the R-rated, X-Men-adjacent surprise blockbuster of 2016 works maybe a little too hard in the service of a dubious cause.* 

[ScreenCrush - Matt Singer](http://screencrush.com/deadpool-2-review/)

> *Leitch and writers Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Ryan Reynolds try to shoehorn in a half-hearted anti-violence message that is among the funniest (and most hypocritical) things in Deadpool 2. (You gleefully bask in the slaughter of dozens, then try to suggest that there’s a “better way” than killing someone who did something awful to you? Yeah no.) Still, there’s some genuine warmth in the end of this film, and it works a lot better than it should. As Deadpool 2unfolds, we come to see that beneath the wisecracks, it is very sincerely about the importance of family in everyone’s lives.* 


[Screenrant - Molly Freeman](https://screenrant.com/deadpool-2-movie-reviews/)

> *Ultimately, it pays off with a Deadpool sequel that is bigger and better than the first film. It honors everything that worked in the original Deadpool, while delivering a more fun and complete movie experience in Deadpool 2 that will win over even those that weren't wholly impressed by the first film.* 

[Uproxx - Vince Mancini](https://uproxx.com/movies/deadpool-2-review-ryan-reynolds-marvel/)

> *Is Deadpool 2 obnoxious? Is it needlessly self-aware? Is it drunk on its own fairly tame naughtiness? Is it so stuffed full of unrelated pop culture references that it sort of feels like a meme shirt come to life? The answer to all those questions is a resounding yes, but it’s also, weirdly, refreshing. For all its light provocations and general desperation, it also has something its main competitors at Marvel* lack: a sense of play. The stakes suddenly aren’t so huge, and it’s not until you’re watching it that you realize how exhausting those constantly-raising stakes had been.* 


[SlashFilm - Josh Spiegel](http://www.slashfilm.com/deadpool-2-review/)

> *Much like its predecessor, Deadpool 2 is less a movie than a smirky, feature-length meme generator. Though the sequel has a new director and some new cast members, Deadpool 2 is unsurprisingly doubling down on what made the first film such a big hit, including jokes about exactly how big of a hit at the box office it was, as well as plenty of other fourth-wall-breaking moments. Considering that the original was successful, it’s somewhat predictable that this sequel is going to the same well of snark and glib ultra-violence, but this is just as obnoxious as its predecessor, if not more so.* 

[Variety - Andrew Barker](http://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/deadpool-2-film-review-1202810071/) - [SPOILERS (probably)]

> *At its best, the film resembles nothing less than an ultraviolent Looney Toons spinoff, with Reynolds once again going full Bugs Bunny behind either a mask or a mountain of makeup — his extremities all akimbo, his rapid-fire comic patter usually landing on just the right side of obnoxiousness. At its worst, there’s something mustily mid-’90s about its self-congratulatory rudeness, its sensibilities lying somewhere between a Farrelly brothers film and a Mountain Dew commercial. * 

[The Verge - Bryan Bishop](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/14/17353740/deadpool-2-review-ryan-reynolds-josh-brolin-marvel)

> *The result isn't as novel as the original, or as effortlessly kinetic, but it is nevertheless a joke-packed action film that continues to deliver on the character's potential, while opening up the door to an even bigger series of sarcastic superhero adventures.* 

[Vox - Alex Abad-Santos](https://www.vox.com/summer-movies/2018/5/14/17350316/deadpool-2-review)

> *The film’s high-density array of insults, references, and jokes works because its target audience — comic book fans especially — has a love for the drama, visuals, and fantasy of superheroes. And by providing the latter in generous amounts, Deadpool 2 has the potential to make fans of us all.* 

[The Wrap - Alonso Duralde](https://www.thewrap.com/deadpool-2-film-review-ryan-reynolds-josh-brolin/)

> *If you’re a fan of those hits, of course, then you’ll enjoy this encore, but anyone who wasn’t amused by the first go-round isn’t going to hop on board for this entertaining but by-the-numbers do-over.* "
