"I (inexperienced cook) need a simple, but delicious Italian recipe I can make for a date",Anonymous8675,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/14yyf3w/i_inexperienced_cook_need_a_simple_but_delicious/,127,17,"I’m not a very experienced cook. I have a girl coming over and I told her I’d cook her favorite cuisine for her, to which she responded that she loves Italian.

What Italian dish can I make that is relatively easy to make, but delicious. It will need to be something with meat as I hate dishes without meat in them. 

Please link or type the exact recipe as I’ll still be equally lost if someone just says, “Chicken Parmigiana”

Thank you in advance, seriously. I’m so lost lol"
