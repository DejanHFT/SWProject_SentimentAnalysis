Potential concept for a grand-strategy game,Darksouls0ni0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/zjxi74/potential_concept_for_a_grandstrategy_game/,9,0,"Imagine a paradox-style grand strategy game. This time it covers periods from imperator Rome to the modern day. Additionally, there is a narrative game below the grand-strategy where you can play an individual character in the world you are playing and go on a narrative adventure.

Edit: You can pause the campaign like in other paradox games. But for like the NPC controlling stuff. You control an NPC however minor or great they are. When you control an NPC you enter a third and may be a first-person view of the area you select you NPC from. From there you enter an open-world like area where you can explore and see the buildings and lands. The lands become more developed and building architecture change as you progress the grand-strategy game. There may be like on major quest in the third person part where you have to commit quiet a bit to receive a bonus in the grand strategy game."
