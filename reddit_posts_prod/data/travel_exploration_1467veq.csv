What are your favorite off center staying locations for exploring major cultural hubs?,tenant1313,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1467veq/what_are_your_favorite_off_center_staying/,8,1,"I love exploring big cities - especially the kind that have tons of museums, long history, great architecture and food scene. But I really dislike staying in the middle of the touristy madness a la Times Square. Crowded, expensive and really not very beneficial in terms of exploring: you still need to get out and commute everywhere, sometimes quite far. So, when I travel, I always try to find spots that are cute, quiet, have a local feel, are possibly cheaper and well connected to the larger city. I actually like commuting - it's part of my traveling experience. Plus I collect transit cards as souvenirs. 

So I basically look for a few nice cafes where I could get a bite and a coffee in the morning, a couple of interesting restaurants where they don't have menus with pictures (a sure sign of crappy food), a bus, metro, tram or a train stop within a walking distance, 30-45 min ride to the main city. I specifically mean separate, ""satellite"" cities but if you want to include your favorite neighborhoods that seem to fit the description, go ahead. Something like Estrella or Campo de Ourique in Lisbon come to mind. Anyway, my favorite examples would be:

Leiden when visiting Amsterdam

Potsdam when visiting Berlin

Covington when visiting Cincinnati 

Downtown Jersey City when visiting New York

Oliwa when visiting Gda≈Ñsk (you could argue here that Oliwa is within city limits - true)

Yokohama when visiting Tokyo
