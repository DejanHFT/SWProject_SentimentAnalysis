Time for the new Minecraft: Education? A new game-based learning platform,Dariuscxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/17klmeh/time_for_the_new_minecraft_education_a_new/,0,0,"We decided to challenge Minecraft  
  
It is a coincidence that just recently Minecraft’s community had a petition with over 500k people to stop MOB VOTE and start taking new content seriously. Our indie games studio decided to take on Minecraft for a different reason.  
  
I’ve been a Lithuanian sandbox games YouTuber for the past 13 years and for the past 6 years my startup Three Cubes created content on Minecraft: Education Edition for education purposes. We grew our team to 25 people and realised that it’s genuinely limiting to develop content on Minecraft: Education - no content ownership, lack of monetisation, lack of tooling and you can’t even make your tools as there is no access to the underlying code, not even dedicated servers and a very complicated way to get licenses. And we realised that general Minecraft isn’t that far better either. It could be way better. This year we decided to push the boundaries, take the challenge and create the next-gen platform reimagining voxel-based game and user-generated content in it. We are very early in development, but not early as a startup.  
  
Focusing on expanding the concept of a voxel-based platform for creativity, adding deeper complexity, and modular themes, focusing on the innovative and adaptable approach to UGC with powerful tools, and adding an optional layer of education. Also, we want to let players test and play from the very first stages.  
  
We are announcing more info about our game this Friday at 6 PM (November 3, GMT+0) at a LIVE event with Q&A.  
  
If you are passionate about sandbox games, UGC on other games or game-based learning, I invite you to join our Live event and support us on this journey!
