Discuss and Learn Philosophy,greece666,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/vkq9ve/discuss_and_learn_philosophy/,0,16,"Hello, this post is for those of you who want to study and discuss philosophy.

We are a group of avid philosophy readers and organize weekly, in depth readings. No prior knowledge is required. We proceed slowly reading 4-6 pages per week. Meetings last 90 minutes each.

Current groups include: Plato's *Timaeus*, Nietzsche's *Beyond Good and Evil*, Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics*, Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations*, and Max Stirner's The Unique and its Property.

Organizers include yours truly (DPhil, Oxon, 2014), Constantine (a classicist with several publications) and many more including both university students and lecturers.

This project started a year and a half ago and it's entirely free to participate. You can join us here: https://discord.gg/jYsCcZ4wqg"
