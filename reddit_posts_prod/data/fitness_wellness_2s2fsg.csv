How do i make my legs bigger. (Dumb question but well.. yea dumb question),sleepy9010,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2s2fsg/how_do_i_make_my_legs_bigger_dumb_question_but/,57,5,"I am a 14M. My legs are smaller than I would like, and my upper body(waist up) looks like it is a tad big for my legs. I workout at my school weight room (I used to go to an actual gym in the summer, 5 days a week. Because of school, I stopped going) 3 times a week, doing leg press (270lb-315lb, 15-20 reps each, 3 sets), and leg extension (50lb-75lb 20 reps each, 2-3 sets). I don't do weighted squats because i don't want to stunt my growth. I don't take protein shakes either because my parents feel that I am took young for that. Help..
EDIT: my calorie intake is maybe 1200-2000. Depends on the day and how much i sleep during the day"
