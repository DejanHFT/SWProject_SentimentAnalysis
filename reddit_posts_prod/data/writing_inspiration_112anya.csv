Spoiled for choice in regards to ideas and inspiration,AndreasLa,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/112anya/spoiled_for_choice_in_regards_to_ideas_and/,11,0,"I--like many others--have had a hard time sticking with one project, one idea and some such. I can read Kings of the Wyld and wanna tell a DnD-like party story of a group of people going on some epic quest. Then, I watch a movie, for example, Indiana Jones, and be like, You know what? A treasure hunting story would be cool. Then, I play fuckin' Hogwarts Legacy and start thinking about a magic school bullshit. Then, I read mythology and start thinking about that. And I've come to the conclusion that I am too spoiled for choice. My ideas aren't my own so much as straight pulled from shit around me. And while that's how most ideas start I am never truly invested in any one idea to actually see it through. That used to be easier than now--after sum double digit amount of rejections on previous stuff.  
How do ideas come to you guys and how are you able to stay interested as opposed to it being some fleeting fancy?"
