Historical Entrepreneurs??,Thunderbird93,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/j605sr/historical_entrepreneurs/,18,22,So I majored in Economics but History fascinates me. Currently reading about Xerxes of Persia. Can anyone here point me not to rulers but successful businesspeople from the distant past? I already have John D Rockefeller's autobiography but I want to go further back. The further distant into the past the businessman lived in the better. Thank you and I look forward to your feedback
