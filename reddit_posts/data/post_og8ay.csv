What helped you kick depression?,allthrowawaytaken,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/og8ay/what_helped_you_kick_depression/,1025,436,"I've been very depressed for years. Finally, I got a prescription for Prozac from my GP, and it's really helped remove the ""bottom"" out of my depression.

However, I'm still depressed a lot more than I'd like, and I would like to work to kick this depression thing's ass once and for all. What's worked for you?"
