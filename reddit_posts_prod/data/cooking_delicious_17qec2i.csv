What are you guys bringing for thanksgiving this year? Looking for something a bit more unusual but delicious/impressive.,throwaway01957,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/17qec2i/what_are_you_guys_bringing_for_thanksgiving_this/,249,111,"My boyfriend and I have been dating about a year and this will be my first Thanksgiving with all of his family (many of which I will be meeting for the first time) so I wanted to make a good dish to impress! 

I usually always bring a homemade cranberry sauce to any Thanksgiving meal I go to, because they usually have the canned stuff and I like bringing a fresher option (and it’s much tastier, in my opinion!) So I’ll bring that and I wanted to bring another dish. It sounds like all of the classic main dishes are accounted for at my boyfriend’s family’s celebration, so I was hoping to get some inspiration for something delicious to make that no one else would be bringing already."
