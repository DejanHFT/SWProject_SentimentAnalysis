"The viability of Cantor's version of a universal transet: Zermelo, Gödel, Brouwer, and Kant, their place in the evaluation of the Cantorian absolutely infinite as the agent of intellectual intuition, and applications of ORD = God in pluralistic higher set theory",Ripheus23,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ycwigo/the_viability_of_cantors_version_of_a_universal/,0,1,"**Abstract.** The target conclusion of our argument is that Cantor's representation of the ""thing"" that we usually nowadays call by the name of *V*, i.e. his belief that the counterpart of *V* in his mostly implicit theory is explicitly said to not be a *genus supremum*, happens to represent a relatively ""novel"" option in the portrayal of absolute infinity. It is fairly distinct from what contemporary set theorists are accustomed to saying about things like universal sets or proper classes or multiverses. It is not a universal generalization, but rather something much more akin to what Kant called by the name of the *ens realissimum* or transcendental ideal, and which ended up being the object of Gödel's ""infamous"" proof of God. We also trace theomorphic mathematical possibilities (a preemptive category theory of deity) that lurk in some of the axiom schemes and background logics offered up by Zermelo and Brouwer for the sake of adequately describing ""all the sets,"" and we do reflect on that difficult ""proof"" of Gödel's, modulo a ""wacky"" consequence of naive deontic logic. After a discussion of intellectual intuition as ""described"" in Kant's first Critique, we finish by showcasing some of the exotic, bizarre, or even absurd ramifications of God = *V*. Whether such absurdity testifies against the final viability of Cantor's implicit doctrine, which however is effectively an echo of Kant's placement of the *ens realissimum* as a concept in the architectonic of reason, we will of course be enjoined to let the reader decide without trying to overconfidently make our case. ""QED""...

§1. *What Cantor thought about* Ω *and* ת

Cantor equated well-definability, or comprehension schematics, with well-ordering. Though it was his student Zermelo who came up with a more plausible explanation for how all sets might be well-orderable, Cantor still recognized early enough on that if ORD and CARD, which he symbolized as Ω and ת (the latter being ""all the alephs"" and so all well-ordered transfinite cardinals, with unorderly cardinals simply wiped from existence), were classified as proper sets, incoherence would apparently emerge from the theory. But though having ORD and CARD as ultrasets, or even something like the modern proper classes, Cantor also imagined that the truly absolutely universal transet (where *transet* just means anything along the thematic lines of proper classes or multiverses) was not a *genus supremum*, i.e. not an austere generalization over all the (other) sets or ultrasets/classes, but a vibrant, indeed literally all-powerful force. God Itself, no less.

§2. *Zermelo's flip-flop on the temporal-particularity factor in ""knowledge"" of the universal transet; also a bit about Brouwer*

When Zermelo came up with the axiom (scheme) of choice (AC), he was concerned to argue that Cantor, valiantly or not, was still incorrect in trying to justify and explain the process of well-ordering with reference to a supposed well-ordering of temporal sets in physical reality. However, much later, Zermelo would say that *V* was an effectively paracomplete structure, an ""unfinished"" existential totality. So somehow the process, in time, of learning about new levels of infinity, would be at least a shadow of a transformative process that *V* itself is eternally undergoing.

And though Zermelo repeatedly tried to undermine the mystical option in set theory, it is a little odd, or ironic, that the most natural model of the entity that could *actually* make all the choices that are supposed to go into AC's objective satisfaction, is the agent of intellectual intuition. In fact, ORD = God would establish the well-ordering lemma absolutely invincibly, since we could just have it that the divine intellect Itself *forced* every set whatsoever to have at least an implicit well-ordering to its name. Nothing can overpower the all-powerful (although other agents with free will can at least grieve Its Spirit, so to say), so nothing could stop God, as ORD, from well-ordering all the sets.

This is not *quite* as silly as it sounds. The divine nature is typically conceived as having absolute rank. In a domain of discourse with Cantorian ultrasets, for example, this means something whose rank would have to be ORD, and moreover superimposed for mathematical reasons upon the standard cardinal ascent. Another option is that God ""transcreated"" every possible set ""somewhere"" in the Hamkins multiverse, even unorderly ones (e.g. the vaporous monsters of amorphism) , which still does mean that all of ת exists, to be sure. The Hamkins-Löwe theorem in the modalized theory of multiversal forcing is that the specific modal logic appropriate to the ""situation"" is S4.2; NBG set/class theory also uses a variation on the logical background to represent its purpose, namely the many-sorted variety of quantifier theory. So we see that distorting or evolving our background logic, even in relatively subtle ways, allows us to formulate particular discourse about transet-dimensional concepts more broadly.

So by extension, and to fend off more potential accusations of local silliness, we will say that the most fitting known logics for multiverse theories of sets overall and axiomatic pluralism *simpliciter* are going to be plurally quantified (this to implement Hamkins' remark about ""no absolute background concept of ordinals or sets"") and either modal-predicate or modal-propositional, the former covering the notion of multiverses (we don't ever quantify singularly over ""the"" or ""a"" multiverse, but we just plurally quantify over *universes*) and the latter covering the notion of abstract propositions encoding for ""possible"" universes (and so where we plurally quantify over modalized axioms themselves).

Now as we will explain in more detail later, the idea of intellectual intuition is of something that is able to refer just by trying to do so: it has its intuition, which is here exactly technically a particularized item of knowledge, not a general/generic one. In other words, intellectual intuition is quantifier-theoretic, e.g. axiogenetically (per Nicholas Rescher's floated doctrine). Accordingly, the theory of God = *V* can be designed on the basis of this unusual deviation on the theme of quantifier theory, namely the universal transet, as God, is the One doing the plural quantification over universes or axioms in abstract space.

One upshot of all this is that Brouwer came tantalizingly close to realizing the potential role of the concept of intellectual intuition in set theory, but ""missed the mark"" by closing off the ""power-level"" of his imaginary ""freely creative subject."" For this abstract subject is no more supposed to be a particularly real deity than are ""ideally empathetic spectators"" in various relatively naive ethical theories. At any rate, Zermelo and Brouwer may both have wished to avoid deifying ORD or CARD (or whatever), but accidentally smuggled the theme of deity through the undertunnels of set theory, so that it can reemerge at some future date, as long as someone takes the time to think through what it would mean, even just in ""if-then"" terms, for equations like ORD = God to be intelligible and true.

§3. *Gödel channels the ghost of Anselm*

For some reason, Gödel tried to recapitulate the argument for the *ens realissimum* that Kant had many, many years before strongly undermined. But a saying like ""a cardinal so large that if it didn't exist, a contradiction would be true,"" as some logically ethereal characteristic, and the *defining* characteristic no less, of some cardinal, is not admissible. It might be fair to say that *V* is like that, since if we go the Fregean route, *V* is really ""the amount of numbers overall,"" whether it is otherwise set-like or not. Consequently, the deeper Fregean reason for the universal transet to be such a thing is because it encompasses any term *x* such that *x = x*, which is ""of course"" everything whatsoever. If this transet did not exist, or if none of its intended elements ended up existing through it, then nothing would be such that *x = x*, so the laws of identity, negation, and noncontradiction would be overthrown, and all possible and impossible worlds would be torn asunder in the logically diabolical lightning-plasma storm of an inferential supernova.

“Since this obviously hasn’t happened,” the pseudo-Fregean would be impelled to say that if *V* didn’t exist, a contradiction—every contradiction—could or would be true. Then by reflection you get some “actual cardinal” that shares this property, or you would if this was one of the properties of *V* that can be reflected (hint: it isn’t, because if it’s given per Frege, it’s given as *the* essential characteristic of *V*, the “reason why” *V* is the universal transet, due to the absolutely unrestricted universality of the *x = x* relation; and these are exactly the properties of *V* that do not admit of justifiable reflection). At any rate, perhaps you could still get such a creature on some other “evolutionary basis,” maybe abstracting it from some other “intrinsically plausible” set, like omega/the zeroth aleph say; the point is, the Anselm cardinals (we’ll call them) are defined-into-existence in terms of a wrongheaded “concept of” existence, as things that simply “must” be quantified over, “of their own accord,” just because that’s how they’ve been defined. Hello unicorn cardinals on your perfect multiversal islands!

So “obviously,” it is amiss to try to introduce Anselm cardinals into the world, yet modern set theorists are not well-trained to resist such notions, but are lured by arbitrary impredications to venture towards such an obscenely silly locale. Or so the harsher predicativists (or constructivists/intuitionists) might say. I do not intend to be harsh about beliefs that I don’t actually understand well enough in the first place; to this day, after a cumulative total of four years researching higher set theory, I *still* see my mind’s eye glaze over while passing across a strong majority of the notation that I read through. Instead, I will just note that Gödel implicitly understood that the *ens realissimum* was a better “concept” than *V*, in the sense of a more cogent “universal object,” seeing as the static block of sets that *V* looks like from the outside turns out to be shot through with structural defects, down from its empty-set foundations up through the forests of its embedding algebras and consistency-strength spirals. God, on the other hand, as the agent of intellectual intuition, or (see below) even the necessary agent of the LNC in naive deontic logic, can run through absolutely infinite sequences like Ω and ת (ORD and CARD) without forming a contradictory representation; not that if God didn’t exist, then a contradiction would be true, but that if God didn’t exist, then Ω and ת would generate contradictions which, though false, are unavoidable (as transcendental illusions), and no one could be found to open the scrolls of their reproof so as to bring them into universal harmony instead. If ORD and CARD are knowable through and through, and if *we*, or anything “remotely like us,” can’t know them through and through, then it must be some other being Who satisfies their final knowability, i.e. God. QED

So it was Gödel's *ens realissimum* that was more faithful(!) to Cantor’s spirit than Zermelo’s paracomplete *V*, although for whatever reason Gödel never publicly said that his “God” was the “surrogate” for a universal set or class as *V*. Yet that is the outcome of the idea, both historically (as an expression of Cantor’s theology, transmitted in a faultily “demystified” form through Zermelo) as well as thematically (in that the very idea of intellectual intuition itself serves the role of *V* in a fully Kantian intuitionistic set theory). In other words, this is where Gödel got his own intuition about intuitionism, or constructivism, from: his own insight into the actual nature of the kind of intuition Kant would have said was needed to symbolize absolute infinity, which is an intuition that actually does “obey” the LEM through and through (it has no reason not to, since a “proof” of any proposition or its negation is always available to such a transcendent being). But so since there is a concept of absolute intuition, the concept of the *ens realissimum* and its knowledge of all things, and this concept does “mark out” the apex of transfinality, then for reasons of *imitatio Dei* ought we, mortal human mathematicians that we are, to look for “constructive” proofs as often as possible, or then without remit in the limit (though since for us the idea of God is regulative more than constitutive, this limit is always shifting as time passes, and it will come to pass that for a while we will have yet to find constructive proofs for this or that proposition).

Again, one might suggest that Zermelo smuggled some theology into the axioms through the back door of well-ordering via the infinitely-many-choices-to-be-made principle. If he did so, he seems to have probably done so subconsciously for the most part, since when he attempted his own description of *V* much later, the image he provided not only flew in the face of what he had said about omitting temporal particularity (intuition, that is) from consideration of the well-ordering problem, but managed to convert generally infinite sequences of actual infinities into a universally *potentially* infinite such sequence, one with nevertheless actually infinite subsequences (e.g. all the alephs from the zeroth through the *n*th-unto-omega). Such a self-contradiction, both personal and technical in character, would have been no small feat for such a focused researcher. We do not condemn Zermelo, then; he was verging on questions of paracompletion and paraconsistency for the logic of set theories when pushed ‘too far’ towards the zone of absolute existential rules, and what he lacked in scholastic prophecy he made up for in open-minded ingenuity.

Still, we think that Gödel’s quest for the *ens realissimum* was closer to reaching Cantor’s goal, as it were, than Zermelo’s quest for the choice scheme’s justification, even if (again) the most natural interpretation, metaphorical or not, of the “being” that could *actually* make the relevant “choices” would be a being equipped with intellectual intuition, i.e. God. To draw an analogy with Dante’s theological adventures, Gödel would have rested only when he reached the seventh heaven, for the “contemplatives” who dwell on the concept of God’s own intuition; Zermelo was satisfied by the lower heaven of the sun, where abstract, or generalized, knowledge of God is the hallmark of the “inhabitants.” Moreover, purely on account of having discovered the incompleteness phenomena and their attendant model-theoretic protocols (applications), Gödel  had an apparently more direct insight into the boundary between generalization and particularity than Zermelo independently would have had: Zermelo knew enough to realize also that inaccessible cardinals, for example, would if uncountable also be ZFC-transcendent, but to fully grasp this realization, he had to wait on G\[oe\]del’s results.

It would be useful, I think, if we could have asked Paul Cohen what *his* intuition, here, was. He had the foresight to imagine that the Continuum’s cardinality could be forced towards the edges of our concepts of set-theoretic universes, despite its seemingly simple, even humble, “origins” in a mere exponential of base 2, raised to the power of the lowest transfinite number. Though for model-theoretic reasons, his belief that the schematic replacement function is “weaker” than the powerset one has not turned out to be directly correct, still, replacement is much more powerful when equipped with the powerset relation than when used alone. Hypothetically, we can turn the first beth number (not the zeroth!) into a fixed point of the aleph function, which fixed point has no other identifying characteristic besides being the powerset that it is (of at least the zeroth aleph, although we can also set it to be the powerset of every set below it), and thereby shunt virtually the entire beth hierarchy above the streams of alephs based on “mere replacement,” not to mention outside of the land of sets altogether (if we work in some class theory and CLASS-ify (e.g. ORD-ify) some applicable forcing on whichever aleph’s powerset, down to the zeroth’s). This latter option is surprisingly less “realistic” if we lack replacement and so have *V* = the omegath aleph, since then we’d be forcing the Continuum’s cardinality to be something cofinal with the zeroth aleph, which is otherwise not usually expected to be possible. But at any rate, Cohen’s intuitions about *forcing itself* are “perilously” (delightfully!) close to an imaginary intuition of the divine intellect’s impact on “all the sets”: game-theoretic/semiotic formalist though he was or not, *we* can adapt Cohen’s picture to the theological version of semiotics just so as to have it be divine “nice names” that authenticate, in the transfinal limit, any proposed forcing.

In other words, Cohen *could* have at least complemented Zermelo as well as Gödel, in the service (deliberate or not) of recapitulating the possibility of an absolute transet as Cantor envisioned It. And yet still, again, it seems to have been only Gödel who really tried to place the crown on the whole idea as such: only his *ens realissimum* “mimics” the inchoate oracle of Cantor’s about the universal transet not being a *genus supremum* but some *particularum*, ultimate in might and glory and knowledge no less, hence because of Its transcendent ideality (not transcendent*al*, as Kant would have explained, describing the act of creation *as* an act of intellectual intuition). 

§4. *Another bit of ""silliness,"" this time because of deontic logic*

One of the wacky ramifications of naive deontic logic is that the LNC is encoded as an ought-sentence (or **OB***S-*sentence, to be precise), which leads to the ""existence"" of a set of beings, either at least one eternal satisfier of the bizarre theorem or a sequence of beings who at least come into ""existence"" anew whenever prior entities of this nature fade away. But it is strange in the extreme to imagine ""upholding"" the LNC, or that the LNC could be magically violated by the Form of Evil, so to say, if it were not for these burden-bearers, deific or merely ""angelic"" as these would turn out to be. Suffice it to say, most deontic logicians would like to derive a different thesis in this subcontext, but as far as I know, the working-out of alternatives has yet to be achieved to most anyone’s ultimate satisfaction. In a sense, we do know in advance that there is something wrong with this strange theorem, but parsing the problem in the context of the other deontic puzzles alongside themes like combining logics, say, is not the easiest task imaginable. Regardless, then, if we want to have ORD = God = an Anselmian monster-protector of the LNC, we could hardly do better than by adopting exactly the naive deontic logic which “establishes” such a thing from the get-go. QED? Not really, except as a joke (*the* Joke, perhaps, no less).

§5. *The origins of the focused concept of intellectual intuition*

Kant’s questions should come back to haunt the above “deductions,” however. Not just what he said about existence not being a predicate, but what he *positively* said about the role of the transcendental ideal, the *ens realissimum*, as God, in the architectonic of reason. Politically, Kant would have none of it from those who wished to compel the rendering of “service unto God,” not only for lack of a sufficiently cosmopolitan spirit of God in the concepts of human believers historically, but because even the most abstracted icon of the divine nature should not compel any human mortal’s rational belief. It must be *optional* if we entertain and apply the God hypothesis, so to speak; and it is truly optional, we do not go astray either if we do accept such a hypothesis *for ourselves, on our own terms.* 

More perspicuously, if Kant had not blinded himself to the possibility of using infinity as a specifiable quantity as much as a category-theoretic quality, he might’ve anticipated the omegas and the alephs much as he accidentally anticipated at least the logical possibility of non-Euclidean geometry. So one imagines that he could easily have adapted the notion of infinite synthetic sequences that are locally incompletable by us to a story about how *absolute* infinity, among the transfinite sets, is the unreachable moment of complete synthesis overall. Which, then, is just to say that the objective, internal meaning of intellectual intuition is unknowable for us, because our only knowledge of such intuition is far too generalized for synthetic finality (which requires the exhaustion of particularity). Rather than a dimly lit, if gigantic, container being the transet of all the sets, reason paints a picture of an ineffable radiance which compasses the sets like pure space compasses the mere possibility of stars (more deeply than physical space ‘surrounds’ the actuality of any starlight, then); or so Kant might have surmised. Kant could have accepted realism and intuitionism in set-theoretic logic, then, as thesis and antithesis, with intuitionism being admissible on the side of transcendental eternity, surprisingly. (More or less, the empiricist options for the antinomies turn out to be the ones for which unboundedly infinite sequences are to be resolutely had, whereas the options that collapse to more superficially theism-friendly descriptions like “the beginning of time” or “prime matter” or “spontaneous willpower” are the rationalistic ones; intuitionism, notwithstanding Brouwer’s talk of a “freely creating subject,” seems aligned with a modest empiricism more than a stark-raving-mad rationalism-realism chimera/hybrid, so to say, so here we note that this is otherwise abnormal for the antinomies in that normally intuitionism would then seem to fall on the side leading to unrestricted infinities—which it clearly does not, both technically and for reasons of the sentiments of intuitionists on average themselves.)

Ironically or not, then, even more than Gödel's, *Kant’s* philosophy of mathematics justifies, in the historical limit, Cantor’s account of the universal transet—not Cantor’s account of this as a being Who especially revealed the secrets of transfinite numbers to him, though, but as a being Who, although possible in the erotetic (question-theoretic) domain of reason, cannot be known to be possible more substantially, outside of our ability to ask questions proper. The *mysterium tremendum* more than the *ens realissimum*, if you will. But still a being such that if It existed, It would indeed “house” all the eternal sets, or “witness” them (from the outworkings of Its own will!) *as if* It “contained” them in “one eternal now.”

And since, despite even worse odds than Kant's beforehand, Cantor’s thematic equivalent of *V*, i.e. the agent of intellectual intuition, has ""proven"" a better description of the thing we nowadays describe in terms of *V*, it turns out that Kant too was, as such, “closer to correct” about the foundations of mathematics than we might have expected (had he known set theory in his own day, he would’ve understood that absolute infinity is a transcendental ideal, and since there is only one transcendental ideal over the other such ideas in Kant’s system, Kant would have been able to move straight to the equation God = *V*, or ORD = God, or whatever along those lines). For if the universal transet *just is* the ultimate foundation of all reality, including the reality of all the sets and hence all the mathematics built from them, and is identifiable as the ultimate reality Itself *because of* Its rank over the sets (which otherwise represent all the ranks there are), then Kant had a more accurate picture of the ideal of mathematical reason than the pseudo-modern picture of the ideal unity as a lifeless blob of merely (barely!) possible symbols (though note that the organic geology of multiverses with “cores”, delved by Hamkins machines with all their buttons and switches, is certainly not so lifeless; unfortunately, though, it may very well be *undead*, in the Cthulhuesque sense of that term…). (As they say, ”That is not dead which can eternal lie / and in strange eons even death may die…”)

§6. *Bizarre results in the theory of God =* V

Now to demonstrate that God = *V* has relatively nontrivial, but also fantastical, implications. For example, there are no nontrivial elementary embeddings of *V* into itself, because this would imply that the divine nature could represent Itself in full and yet “mismatch” some of Its characteristics, to yield the critical points of such embeddings. Moreover, there are no nontrivial embeddings of *V* into anything else whatsoever, neither of anything else into *V*, again on account of the separation between divine and subdivine natures. Even worse, there are no nontrivial models of *V*, e.g. there are no such things as HOD or *L* (or if there are, then somehow proper classes are still lesser than *V*, or something along that line (maybe inescapable incommensurability starts to creep in on this level)). So if there are nontrivial elementary embeddings, they are only of sets into other sets at best.

Some other ‘results’: if there is a universal well-ordering, it would only be if ORD = God (a poetic equation, if ridiculously mystical), i.e. if the divine intellect Itself orders all Its intuitions as such. We might expect this, though, on account of the ultimacy of the divine nature: again, to outrank all other possible objects, God would have to *be* a rank that is also *the* principle of other ranks, all below It. (Again, then ORD = God…) Or the powerset function’s genuine outputs are the ones God has forced to hold, and just as the powerset question on our level is indicated by second-order logic to have some sort of peculiar specific answer, so the question on the level of ORD-order logic is indeed ‘already’ answered by God (such as it is, but see the work of Victoria Gitman, IIRC, for an explanation as to why L^(ORD) isn't quite a ""stable"" enough logic, so to say). ―I have no real clue about a divine automorphism, though. I've read the Hamkins, et. al. paper about how suppressing the foundation axiom vs. Reinhardt/shadow embeddings does allow for *V*\-automorphisms, but to be honest I don't actually know what an automorphism ""is,"" or why it's so ""important"" on this level; I've read the definitions over and over and they don't clearly stick to the walls of my mind. For what it's worth, I'll keep trying to understand it better, but for now, I really don't ""get it.""

Anyway, God is not founded on anything else, and other objects are not ‘constructed from’ God except by creation—which we imagine is a highly exotic species of quantification, following the doctrine that “existence is not a predicate” but an operator that binds variables to quantities from a farther syntactic ‘outside,’ so that causing something to exist is not the same as changing which predicates are true of it as such. (Indeed, distinguishing the created and the uncreated/uncreatable in terms of modalized quantifier theory goes to show how we can alter quantifier and modality theories in surprising ways so as to deliver unusual ideas about universal objects, in this case the divine intellect as a such an object.) But then God is not to be thought of as built up from ur-elements or empty sets or what; God is either an element of Itself or is not an element at all. So God is beyond the axiom of foundation, and does not quite automatically testify on behalf of this axiom among the sets instead. So too are singleton and doubleton axioms abridged at least for God, in that the glyph-strings “{God}” or “{God, the world}”  (this is due to the eldritch saying that ""God with the world does not make up a whole"") are not admissible strings in the theory. But since if there was {God, God} then there would be {God} on account of the extensionality axiom, then not only does the pairwise axiom fail for the divine nature, but so does extensionality, or instead God is the “author” of the extensionality relation (again, per the generic sense we have of the phrase “intellectual intuition”), or “is subsistent being itself” (Aquinas). Once more, “at worst,” extensionality roughly holds just the same except that God is transfounded in Itself, or then is an element of Itself (as well as the determiner of the very concept of something being an element), so the concept of Its extensional quantification is identical to the concept of Itself (It is self-quantifying, in that we say there are ORD-many Gods, which ‘in the limit’ does otherwise mean just one ‘true’ God, somehow). (We speak, then, of a unity or simplicity much more extreme than even normal mathematical unity/simplicity are supposed to be.) And the only way in which everything else is an element of God is as an element of intellectual (active) intuition, which is not the same exact thing as being an element of a set (which is the form of an object of passive intuition, though *pace* Brouwer and his inheritors, the intuition we have of sets is not even the abstract spatiotemporal one they got from Kant, but just rather the generic notion of intuition, which even in Kant is just *any* ‘faculty’ of apprehending particulars instead of just generalities).

In a way, God = *V* implies that pretty much any universal specifier (some sort of ∏-axiom) ""runs out"" at some interlude in the ascending transet (if I understand the application of the Lévy hierarchy well enough, here). God also has no powerset over Itself, and this is a slightly more ""peripheral"" quality that can be legitimately copied by a lower set, which then initiates a powerless hierarchy of large cardinals. Arguably, other even lower, but still large-cardinality, sets can be are reflected out of the suspension of singleton/doubleton axiomatics for the divine nature, and these were-elements, so to say, are what make powerless cardinals incapable of having ""all subsets"" extrapolated from them clearly enough to manifest a complete higher powerset. At least, that is my conjecture at this point. Curiously, if we imagine elements (still well-founded sets, or maybe ur-elements or Quine atoms?) such that they can only be contained in a set of the same size (cofinally) as those elements, and then we maximize the fixed-point characterization of these objects, we end up with a provably parafounded set, namely *X* ∊ min{...}, where {...} has *X*\-many elements, but then (for the sake of fixing the point as precisely as the variables in the function allow for) having *X* itself as an element. 

So the phenomenon of the Kunen wall, where AC is most aggressively fought, but where Corazza cardinals hover in the shadow of the dark Reinhardt embedding, the omega-endgame of its critical sequence, because of an abridged replacement scheme―and so where foundation might be compromised, too―recurs as we ascend the ramparts of *V*. There are always cardinals above the ones we ""know of"" as of now, that are such to be inconsistent with an unrestricted instead of a variably dependent axiom scheme of universal specification upwards. In summary, measurables, for example, are the ""inconsistency strength"" of the unrestricted axiom system of constructibility. The quasi-diminished terms of the embeddings that mark the Kunen border proper, in the land of the sets, mark the ""collapse"" of AC (if not the WOL) then, too. And so there are the abnormally extensional were-elements and the powerless sets they compose. In a precise, almost ""cosmological,"" way, even the foundation axiom is strictly contradicted when unrestricted, for there are reasons in the theory of epistemic justification to accept that infinitism and coherentism are also reasonable, *alongside, as ""friends with,""* foundationalism; but so if the very form of inferential justifiability overall can be any of those three options, or even various combinations of them, then there are fundamental set types corresponding to this moment in erotetic logic. And again, by reflection on God = *V*, we would ""know"" that there were parafounded sets ""somewhere out there,"" in the abyss of Cantor's inferno.

One final note regarding the above: there is a way to frame the attempted embedding of *V* into itself overall as a limitative precept, in Maddy's sense of limitative theories (or Scott's, of Scott's-trick fame, when he said something about how losing measurable cardinals means losing the interesting possible questions you can ask about them). In other words, you could parse the embedding as universally quantified, not over *V* by itself, but all the ranks under and unto *V*, i.e. as the universal specifier that all sets can be merged with embedding-theoretic higher echelons. Since we expect all such specifiers to ""eventually run out,"" this unrestricted embedding ends up suppressed by the possibility of definitively embedding-transcendent cardinals (ones not ""accessible"" via the critical-point operation, and from which no relevant embeddings are possible/permissible). And again, God is not a critical point of even a counterfactual/counterpossible embedding, Reinhardt's maniacal talk about spectral ordinals somehow eclipsing ORD notwithstanding.

§7. *Conclusion*

Albeit it is a very ""weird"" idea, the meaning of the sum of Cantor's remarks about the universal transet being the divine intellect *can* represent the absolute ineffability that other set theorists have indeed attributed to that transet. And, perhaps surprisingly, this idea does deliver some specific answers to some specific questions about higher set theory (e.g. the nonexistence of ""most"" desired embeddings). (Note we might still be able to tinker with the axioms/logic to get measurables that are introduced by just the ultrapower theme rather than the embedding-theoretic one as well.) We hope to have provided evidence that even sharp academics like Zermelo accidentally transferred the theological subtext of Cantor's set-theoretic life into the social future; and this will always happen ""one day,"" actually (there is *some* connection with ""when"" some axiomatic specifier or other ""runs out"").  At least as long as transfinite set theory still stands, that is. On the other hand, a theory of a divine type or a category-theoretic treatment of deity might still carry God = *something* into another future. Again, per Kant, we do not say that the narrative ""requirement"" that God = *V*, here, is knowably objectively a fact. If anything, the wacky story's major application is to the problem of epistemic sets. The singleton-transcendent, powerless, etc. aspects of *V* become intertwined with the progressive breakdowns and reconstructions of our higher set theories and their axioms. Perhaps we lose much of the embedding game and its algebra, but we seem to gain many curious mirror cardinals, in this case. We must perpetually recalibrate various classical or new axioms, rendering them dependent (as with dependent choice, say, so then dependent powerset, too, etc.). The set of all and only well-foundationally knowable sets, if it existed, could not be an element of itself, so it would be a focal point (another analogy from Kant) for erotetic imagination.

The ""twist,"" then, is that the ORD-equivalent God ""exercises"" Its intellectual intuition *through questions*. It asks general and specific questions, ""all at once at the apex of transfinal eternity,"" and Its own spiritual echo decides the relevant solutions, and the world is transcreated thereby, and so on and on, forever and ever, amen."
