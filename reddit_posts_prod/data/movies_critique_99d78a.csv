I'm watching 28 films in 28 days and doing a critique on each one. This is my challenge for the month.,Lokimonoxide,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/99d78a/im_watching_28_films_in_28_days_and_doing_a/,34,1,"I don't write. But I want to. And I love film. So............. this is my idea to improve my writing.

Teaching elementary school English in Korea for 5 years has taken its toll on my ability to communicate, I think. hahaha

I've already done Senna, Metropolis and The American today and I'm doing Memento and The Spy Who Came in from the cold next. 

Anyone else want to attempt this?
