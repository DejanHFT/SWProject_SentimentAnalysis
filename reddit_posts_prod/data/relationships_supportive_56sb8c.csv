I [30F] am trying to improve my appearance and my husband [31M] isn't being as supportive as I'd like,throwaway10100016,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/56sb8c/i_30f_am_trying_to_improve_my_appearance_and_my/,34,75,"I have been with my husband for four years, and I have been sober for four years. When I first met him at work, I was getting high in the bathroom all the time (coke and heroin). It was pretty obvious to him since the bathroom was located out of sight from everyone else's office or cubicle, but not his. Anyway, he quickly asked me out on a date and we became friends with benefits. I really liked him, but he told me he didn't want anything serious unless I stopped using. So I stopped, and haven't used since.

However, permanent damage has been done to my appearance. There's no amount of living a healthy lifestyle that will fix certain things so I am having things done cosmetically that will drastically help my appearance seem more normal and some things will improve my actual health as well. 

Also, my hair, makeup, clothing and entire appearance in general is rather eclectic to say the least. It's to the point that almost every time we go out, strangers come up to us to talk to me about how ""cool"" something is or to just ask questions. (I know this sounds like BS, but I swear it happens.)

I'm tired of looking unhealthy. I'm tired of looking like I should be an extra in a 90s metal video. I'm tired of people asking questions. My husband understands, but he isn't exactly being supportive. And please believe me when I say that I'm positive that the cost of having these improvements has absolutely nothing to do with his reaction.

My husband is charismatic, has a degree, a fantastic job, and is usually dressed extremely professionally, even when he doesn't have to go to work. He loves how I look now. I've told him multiple times what procedures I'm having done and why. But even after explaining he'll say things like, ""So...why exactly are you having these things done? You know, I like you how you are."" Which seems innocent enough, but he keeps bringing up his work's holiday party. Apparently, he has been telling his coworkers how eclectic I am, and he doesn't want me to look differently when I meet them. This makes me feel really awful and I'm not even sure why.

I don't know how to explain it, but I know he really finds ""extremes"" in people attractive. For example, a hispanic girl with booty shorts, and large breasts sticking out of her shirt. A tall skinny blonde with huge boobs. Overweight ladies with extremely small waists and large breasts. Very muscular/fit women. Women who dress up goth, punk, bohemian, preppy, etc. But it has to be taken to an extreme.

I just want to look healthy and normal. I want my husband to be supportive. He always has been until this. I don't know what to say, do or feel about this.

TL;DR: I am changing my appearance to look ""normal"" and healthy, rather than eclectic and like I've partied a bit too hard. My husband seems disappointed."
