Will individualized cancer vaccines be possible using technology that created the RNA coronavirus vaccine?,Bloodshot_Wolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/lmeip5/will_individualized_cancer_vaccines_be_possible/,4,3,I know in biology class I learned that all cells have surface proteins. And these surface proteins can sometimes be different depending on the type of cell. I also know that the coronavirus vaccine uses RNA to make our immune system react to the coronavirus. Would we be able to use that same technology to create a unique vaccine for everyone to fight against their cancer cells?
