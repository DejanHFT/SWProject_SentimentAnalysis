Jordan Peele's 'Nope' Review Thread,SanderSo47,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/w3q0ck/jordan_peeles_nope_review_thread/,1603,1171,"[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nope): 81% (118 reviews) with 7.60 in average rating

> Critics consensus: Admirable for its originality and ambition even when its reach exceeds its grasp, *Nope* adds Spielbergian spectacle to Jordan Peele's growing arsenal.

[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/nope): 77/100 (46 critics)

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** 

> Peele has assembled a first-rate cast, and the results are electric. Whatever shortcomings the screenplay may have in fleshing out their characters, Kaluuya, Palmer, Perea, Yeun and Wincott deliver memorable turns, successfully balancing Nope’s comedic notes with its more haunting, suspenseful overall mood. Hoyte van Hoytema’s engulfing cinematography and Michael Abels’ pulsating score help sustain the film right up through its transfixing end. It won’t be to everyone’s taste, but Nope offers up a glutton’s feast for Peele disciples and fans of brainy sci-fi thrillers, ushering the director into an intriguing new phase of cinema that’s as rhapsodic as it is demanding.

> While Jordan Peele has fast become one of the most relevant and profitable of modern American filmmakers, “Nope” is the first time that he’s been afforded a budget fit for a true blockbuster spectacle, and that’s exactly what he’s created with it. But if this smart, muscular, and massively entertaining flying saucer freak-out is such an old school delight that it starts with a shout-out to early cinema pioneer Eadweard Muybridge (before paying homage to more direct influences like “Close Encounters of the Third Kind”), it’s also a thoroughly modern popcorn movie for and about viewers who’ve been inundated with — and addicted to — 21st century visions of real-life terror.

-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/07/nope-review-jordan-peele-1234743566/): A-

> Jordan Peele’s “Nope” is a tantalizingly creepy mixed bag of a sci-fi thriller. It’s a movie that taps into our fear and awe of UFOs, and for a while it holds us in a shivery spell. It picks the audience up and carries it along, feeding off spectral hints of the otherworldly. Yet watching the movie, you can just about taste the DNA of Steven Spielberg’s “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” and “Nope” mirrors the trajectory of other films that have been made in the shadow of “Close Encounters,” like M. Night Shyamalan’s “Signs” and Denis Villeneuve’s “Arrival.” Here, as in those films, the anticipation works better than the payoff. 

-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2022/film/reviews/nope-review-jordan-peele-daniel-kaluuya-keke-palmer-1235320483/)

> There’s no accusing of Peele of playing it safe, but the further he gets from the lean cohesiveness of “Get Out,” the more divisive and perplexing his films become. That may well be the point, and “Nope” will certainly set off new debates about what he’s doing, and why, and whether it was worth it. This ultimately feels like four very promising movies mashed together, with spectacular highlights bumping into each other in a way that’s ultimately lacking, even as they all demonstrate the prowess and bravado of the filmmaker.

-[Alonso Duralde, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/nope-film-review-jordan-peele-2022-keke-palmer-daniel-kaluuya/)

> A hilariously bleak vision of the American dream, Jordan Peele’s Nope is a farcical love letter to Hollywood filmmaking. A sci-fi-horror-comedy that builds cinematic myths before casually knocking them over, it’s one of the most effective and purely entertaining summer blockbusters in years, from a studio director at the peak of his craft.

-[Siddhant Adlakha, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/nope-review-jordan-peele): 9.0 ""amazing""

> Jordan Peele’s strange, muddled, indigestible new UFO mystery looks like it had a good fairy and a dodgy fairy present at the birth. The good fairy is Steven Spielberg, to whose Close Encounters and Jaws the film pays an overt tribute. The dodgy fairy is M Night Shyamalan, of Signs and The Happening: the sometimes brilliant, sometimes exasperating high-concept showman whose influence is also present – but unacknowledged, un-homaged. It feels like an event movie in the Shyamalan style, all about the prerelease conjecture and trailer buzz: what on earth can it be about?

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/20/nope-review-jordan-peele-daniel-kaluuya): 2/5

> As a sci-fi fable, Nope feels both more slippery and less viscerally satisfying than the relatively straightforward horror of Get Out or even 2019's Us, but it still sticks. The truth is out there, or up there, in that curiously immovable cloud that looms like a cotton-ball anvil above the Haywood ranch; it's Peele's prerogative to build his world below it, and leave the rest.

-[Leah Greenblatt, Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movies/movie-reviews/nope-jordan-peele-daniel-kaluuya-keke-palmer/): B+

> Nope is structurally closer to Peele’s Us than Get Out. Both films are superbly horrifying nail-biters about families in danger. Their tightly coiled plots are also paired with and subverted by fantastical meta-commentaries about society that don’t completely cohere but have a winning go-for-it audaciousness. But while Nope pushes all the thriller buttons quite effectively, it’s more inconsistent in its attempts to construct something coherent behind the scares.

-[Chris Barsanti, Slant Magazine](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/nope-review-jordan-peele/): 3/4

> Jordan Peele’s masterfully audacious, wickedly funny and utterly outlandish sci-fi horror fable “Nope” is a classic example of a bold and original film that pays homage to a seemingly endless stream of great movies and yet is more than the sum of its parts.

-[Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2022/7/20/23270974/nope-review-jordan-peele-movie-daniel-kaluuya-keke-palmer-steven-yeun-michael-wincott): 4/4

> An ambitious, provocative swing, Nope feels like that increasingly rare beast: an original blockbuster. Unspooling a horrific parody of Hollywood’s hubris, it’s a crowd-pleaser that wonders about the cost of pleasing a crowd.

-[Kambole Campbell, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/nope/): 5/5

> ""Nope"" may not be Jordan Peele's best movie to date, but it is his most enjoyable. A true summer movie spectacle meant to be writ large across the screen, giving us thrills, chills, laughs, and that most precious of things: movie magic. 

-[Chris Evangelista, /FILM](https://www.slashfilm.com/934123/nope-review-jordan-peele-stages-an-absolute-spectacle-with-his-scary-funny-sci-fi-blockbuster/): 9/10

> It would be too much to call Nope a bad movie. Even in Peele’s lack of precision, plenty of good qualities lurk underneath the knottier shortcomings. But this horror flick doesn’t rise to the levels of Get Out or Us, either. It isn’t because in this case, Peele isn’t trying to teach white people to understand the full scope and feeling of racism. It’s because Nope is an idea more than a story. It’s a collection of individually captivating scenes, as opposed to an intriguing whole. It’s a handsome picture, but Peele is far too impressed with its handsomeness to work on populating it with fully felt characters. It might enthrall audiences, and it might frighten them, but it’ll struggle to stay with them after the credits start to roll. 

-[Robert Daniels, Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23271422/jordan-peele-nope-review-alien-invasion)

> Though philosophically unsatisfying in the sum of its parts — it’s a murky mirror — “Nope” remains thoroughly exhilarating as further proof of Peele’s affinity for pushing the increasingly narrow limits of commercial cinema. It’s imperfectly refreshing.

-[Carlos Aguilar, The Playlist](https://theplaylist.net/nope-review-jordan-peele-20220720/): B-

> For Hollywood’s armies of unsung craftsfolk, Nope turns the blockbuster rules on their head: an expansive science-fiction thriller whose heroes rise up and claim their heroism from behind the scenes. For the rest of us, it’s an outrageously good time.

-[Robbie Collin, The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/nope-review-jaws-open-skies-daniel-kaluuya-gives-performance/): 5/5

> But the more I sat with the film, the more I found myself returning to the sequences that work (and I mean really work), and to the way all of Nope’s stories and characters collectively create a portrait of an uncaring entertainment business that’s constantly looking for new targets to chew up. It doesn’t even spit them out. Sometimes, it devours them whole.

-[Matt Singer, Screen Crush](https://screencrush.com/nope-movie-review/): 9/10

> But what comes before is so overflowing with ideas – about the erasure of Black culture, our relationship with past traumas, and the underseen side of the moviemaking business – and so brimming with visual flair, it puts most other blockbusters in the shade. Spend two hours watching it and a couple more unpacking it – with or without that know-it-all mate.
