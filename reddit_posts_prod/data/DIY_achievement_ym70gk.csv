Possible to create a non-electrical water line using 5 gal plastic jugs?,TKB21,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/ym70gk/possible_to_create_a_nonelectrical_water_line/,42,4,"Sounds a little crazy but please bare with me. In short, I currently need a way to power water to a bar gun outdoors. There's no way for me to get ahold of a traditional water line. I thought of using kegs, which would allow me to hose co2 in but given my situation I need about 40 gallons and the kegs themselves can get very pricey. I was wondering if I could achieve this same concept with the kegs (co2 in, water out) but with traditional 5 gal water jugs. If so what additional parts and accessories would I need to make this possible?"
