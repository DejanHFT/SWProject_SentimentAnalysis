Why did the age of Viking expansion/ era come to an end?,WithaClue2010,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/e8rd3c/why_did_the_age_of_viking_expansion_era_come_to/,37,53,"The period 800-1100 roughly was relatively short for Vikings to be well doing Vikingy things I am curious as to why the era came to an end and anything that might have happened to cause such. I do understand that our info is limited due to sources being after said time frame, and the accuracy of the likes of the Vinland sagas is partially confirmed in places at best,  either way though any insight would be helpful."
