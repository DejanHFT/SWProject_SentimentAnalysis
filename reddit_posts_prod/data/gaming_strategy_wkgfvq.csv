I have played total war warhammer 2 already and had alot of fun. Looking at stuff like hero's hour and Song's of Conquest and have them on my steam wishlist already. Looking for ant other games that might have the following.

-Grand strategy with combat being RTS similar to total war warhammer 2.

-Having playable factions of humans, high elves/elves, wood elves, dwarfs and mabye necromancers.

-decent re-playability.

The combat can be turn based but I prefer real time if there are. Graphics aren't a huge issue but again stuff like total warhammer 2 or Song's of Conquest would be optimal."
