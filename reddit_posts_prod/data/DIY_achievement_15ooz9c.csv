Looking for advice on how to frame out a deck on top of this structure,Elpeanut,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15ooz9c,8,3,Wanting to make sure we over do this as far as adding additional supports and bracing to make it as safe and sturdy as possible. Goal is to build a deck up on top of this structure that will serve as a viewing platform on our farm. Any advice on design and how to achieve this would be greatly appreciated!
