Does coffee work as well as preworkout?,tastycakes147,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3pdlv7/does_coffee_work_as_well_as_preworkout/,46,7,"So today I tried preworkout for the first time. At first I thought I was going to throwup/ have a heart attack but then I PR'd on all my lifts, my after lift cardio session I ran faster, still had the energy left for HIIT, did 10 min of abs, and then shot basketball for 30 min. I couldve gone longer but it was afternoon and all I had eaten was a banana so I was starting to get a little hungry. It was amazing what it did but I would like a more natural alternative if it's possible. Does coffee work as well as preworkout from your experience?"
