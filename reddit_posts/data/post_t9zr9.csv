[UPDATE] Need help getting something done? I have unlimited flight benefits this summer and want to spend my summer helping out Redditors.,Generique,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t9zr9/update_need_help_getting_something_done_i_have/,1823,1886,"I've spent the last week creating a **potential** [Mission List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoJOerTtEYWWdFZ5UmUzYXZGaExxbHdEeEtPZjJJaXc#gid=0) from the [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/svoy6/need_help_getting_something_done_i_have_unlimited/), planning, getting shots, and PMing redditors across the planet.  Due to the number of suggested missions and me realizing how one-in-a-lifetime this is, I will be ReVenturing till approximately July 20th.


I leave for San Francisco tomorrow (Monday, May 7th) to meet up with [Zajoba](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/svoy6/need_help_getting_something_done_i_have_unlimited/c4hhyul?context=3) and attempt to accomplish the following missions:


* #0033 - seamstressofink - help paint living room
* #0041 - oliversmom - bring UK plug adapter and mow lawn or wash car
* #0187 - housechore - Sail out around the golden gate bridge

I'll be posting future updates /r/ReVenture, videos to my [youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheReVenture), and tweets to [my twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/RedthePirate).  

If you have ideas for potential Missions (or are on the current [Mission List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoJOerTtEYWWdFZ5UmUzYXZGaExxbHdEeEtPZjJJaXc#gid=0)) or want to hang out/do something if/when I'm in your town, **please PM with your email or phone number- I have been finding that communication via Reddit messages alone is not in everyone's best interests.**

My rough itinerary (subject to change- but fear not, I have many backup Mission destinations) is as follows:

[May 7th - May 10th: San Francisco, California](http://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/t8oak/reventures_first_stop_san_francisco/)

May 10th - May 12th: Seattle, Washington

May 13th - 15th: Marrakesh, Morocco (specifically the Atlas Mountains)

May 16th - 18th: the sky (reading Buffy comics and editing videos to keep my sanity up)

May 18th - 19th: Seoul, South Korea

**EDIT: overwhelmed with comments as expected- I will go ever EVERY SINGLE comment and PM over the next couple days so don't worry- if it's time sensitive (IE in San Francisco within the next few days, be sure to PM)**"
