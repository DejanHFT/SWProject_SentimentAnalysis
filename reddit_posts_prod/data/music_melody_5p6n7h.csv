"Who else thinks the new Gorillaz single ""Hallelujah Money"" is complete garbage?",AllLooseAndFunky,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/5p6n7h/who_else_thinks_the_new_gorillaz_single/,3307,26694,To me it sounds like a preset on an old Roland drum machine with vocals that lack melody or even rhythm. Disappointed is not even close to the word I would use. Confusion and even anger come to mind. What is he thinking?
