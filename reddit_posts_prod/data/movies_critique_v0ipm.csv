"The under loved ""Sunshine"" (if you liked Prometheus, you'll dig this)",AmbientGoat,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/v0ipm/the_under_loved_sunshine_if_you_liked_prometheus/,250,458,"Howdy all,

One of my favorite Sci-Fi Horror movies of all time is Sunshine by Danny Boyle (28 Days later, Sumdog Millionare, 127 Hours, Trainspotting).

Good atmosphere, good art and set style, and well acted. I think its really a shame that this movie failed to reach a mass audience like 28 Days Later did.

Outside the slightly contrived plot (we have to suspend or disbelief to enjoy movies anyway right), this movie does a wonderful job of setting up an atmospheric and claustrophobic experience. I'm not going to write a review or make any gripes (there are some to be had) because I don't want anyone to go into this movie jaded or with otherwise preconceived ideas.

My recommendation, watch this movie without reading any critique before hand. Like Prometheus, just go along for the ride any you'll have a good time. 

edit: Some people are saying this is one of those spoiler trailers, you many want to avoid it. WATCH IT WITH CAUTION.

Sorry if this is actually not as unknown as I think it is, but none of my friends have even heard of it.
