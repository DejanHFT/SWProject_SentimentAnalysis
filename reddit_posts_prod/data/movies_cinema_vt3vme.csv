What was your most bizarre cinema experience?,cherrymachete,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vt3vme/what_was_your_most_bizarre_cinema_experience/,300,159,"Have you ever had a bizarre cinema experience that has stuck with you?
The only four times that stood out for me:

- I was seeing Joker for the second time and a lad who seemed to be having a psychotic break sat behind me. He was talking to an empty seat. He kept saying ""I don't want to!"" over and over. I felt so sad for him. 

- Before watching Annabelle Comes Home, there was an advert about human trafficking where a lady spoke about being abused. This gang of lads behind me began manically laughing when the advert came on. I felt super uncomfortable.

- A couple getting too um, raunchy during The Gentlemen

- Getting hit in the face by a falling phone as a guy ran past me up the stairs during The Playmobil Movie. Tbf I kinda deserved it for going to watch that rubbish. I thought it'd be like The Lego movie, how wrong I was...

These are probably tame."
