How to achieve this type of wood color...,bugaboo754,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/32om5u/how_to_achieve_this_type_of_wood_color/,18,83,"Not sure if this is the correct place to ask(if it isnt, please direct me to the correct place)

My wife would like me to build a dining room table for our next house. We both like the coloring on the table in following link.

How do I achieve this sort of coloring? Is that a wood choice or a stain choice? I'm guessing wood but what kind of wood is it?

Thanks in advance!"
