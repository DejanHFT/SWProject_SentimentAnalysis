"How to achieve this beautiful shine, please help!",scrotiusjokius,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/2ulwdo/how_to_achieve_this_beautiful_shine_please_help/,5,4,"Hey guys! Got a dorky project going on here, and am painting my old NES console. I was inspired after seeing a couple floating around that were really well done.  One guy's work in particular, zoki64, is astounding.  He gets his consoles to shine like crazy, and I want to do it too.  I have no idea what he does, as he doesn't detail his processes anywhere.  Does anyone know how to achieve this level of shine? Link below:
