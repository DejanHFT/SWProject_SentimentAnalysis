MOTIVATION VIDEO by 58 year old and his Trainer,wquong,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1lrego/motivation_video_by_58_year_old_and_his_trainer/,28,38,"This is a video my trainer and I just put up on Youtube.  It is mostly calisthenics but also has some semi heavy lifts.  The video shows what a 58 year old can accomplish in 2 years of training after 25 years of physical inactivity.

We are hoping that the video inspires others to get up and keep moving, we don't have to fall apart as we age.   The video has over 12,000 reviews in just 3 days.
