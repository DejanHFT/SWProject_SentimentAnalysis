How much energy does it take for the body to regenerate the blood lost in a blood donation?,IntermediateAccount,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/r65pw/how_much_energy_does_it_take_for_the_body_to/,1,2,"I found [an informal post](http://www.webcitation.org/66JquI18z) on the subject, but its answers range from 600 to 3500 calories. Similar to [this](http://www.webcitation.org/66JrfAiMx) largely unanswered question, I was wondering what the actual value is (or if that range is accurate, why it varies so much).

I would ask [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/pij94/ama_i_am_medical_laboratory_scientist_ask_me/), but that post seems rather old."
