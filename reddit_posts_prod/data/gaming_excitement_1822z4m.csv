Who else is excited about Tekken 8?,Bambrigade92,https://i.redd.it/ylb3gszg342c1.jpg,61,199,"Tekken 8 is set to release in January 2024! Have always loved the series and wanted to show some love to the series' roots. Tekken 1 PS1 long box and Tekken 2 and 3 from my collection!

Do you have a favorite entry in the series so far and are you stoked for Tekken 8?"
