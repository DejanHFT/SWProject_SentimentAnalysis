What’s a general movie critique that you find annoying?,TrueFork,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/11qx1op/whats_a_general_movie_critique_that_you_find/,722,216,"Alright so I’m curious what everyone’s general movie critique that you find annoying.

For me it’s when people say things like “well why didn’t they just do that?” whenever whatever the “that” that they’re suggesting would mean that we wouldn’t have a movie. There wouldn’t be a story to tell if the character decided to do the wise thing or whatever thing you’re suggesting. 🙄"
