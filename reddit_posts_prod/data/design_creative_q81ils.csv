Suggestions for a workshop about Lateral Thinking and creative process?,mrinflamed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/q81ils/suggestions_for_a_workshop_about_lateral_thinking/,1,1,"Hi! The graphic academy where I teach asked me to prepare a short seminar (3 lessons of 3 hours each) about lateral thinking and thinking outside the box. The target of this seminar are the students of the first year, and they havent started the actual courses/classes yet (they'll start on november). So they can't use any software and they don't have any theoretical knowledge of graphic design. 

I wanted to introduce them to the concept or lateral thinking in order to let them start this academic experience always remembering to think outside the box and to never  settle for an ""adequate"" idea. So I was wondering if you knew interesting activities to do. The age of the students stays between 18 and 28 years, so I can aim for smart/tricky activities. 

I'm open to all kinds of activities, but remembering that they can't use their computers (other than maybe go to some website, but only if thats really necessary).. so basically stuff with paper/pencil/etc or activities involving talking/quizzing/guessing/analizing/etc. But maybe I'm not thinking about some other alternatives...so I'm ready to hear all kind of suggestions! 

Thanks to everyone <3 I'd love to share with you the results of my seminar once its done, crediting your ideas"
