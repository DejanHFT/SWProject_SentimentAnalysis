How to achieve rounder arms (with dumbbells)?,SinnicleSquabble,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3ahfd5/how_to_achieve_rounder_arms_with_dumbbells/,10,1,"I have that problem where my arms look good from the sides but not as good from the front and back. I chalk part of that up to my genetics and skinny build (and I'm not looking to get shredded, just lean and proportional), but maybe I'm also missing out on exercises. 

These are my current exercises:
- biceps curl (supinated and piston)
- hammer curl
- Zottman curl
- cross-body unilateral extension
- overhead triceps extension
- close-grip bench press 

What else would get them to fill out better?"
