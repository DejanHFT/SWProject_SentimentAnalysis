What Games Are You Excited For?,god_pharaoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/178tmb1/what_games_are_you_excited_for/,102,0,"My Steam wishlist has a ton of games in it. Some are already released and I'm waiting for either sales (Fate/Samurai Revenant, Immortals Aveum) or updates to improve games not received well at release (Sengoku Dynasty, Atlas Fallen). Some I don't have too high hopes for but I want to keep up to date with release (Pirates Legacy, Perfect New World, Warhammer Age of Sigmar).

But what are the ones you're really excited for?

I cannot wait for Fable 4 and Gangs of Sherwood.

There's a ton of colony sims and city builders releasing that I want to try as well. 

Long term, Riot Games MMORPG (I don't play their games now, but I love their lore) and GTA 6 as well.

Side note: if you like Pokemon, I just recently started Casette Beasts and it's been a good experience."
