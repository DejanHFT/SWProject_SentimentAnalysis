Need help achieving my goal,bobwoodstock,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/cvbrnr/need_help_achieving_my_goal/,14,15,"Hello, 
I'm a 32 years old male, 179 cm tall and weigh 76 kg. I don't smoke or drink or do drugs. I don't want to have fancy muscles, I just want a flat belly. 
(Not native english)

I was fat my whole life and lost 24 kg, I never gained back what I lost, I can keep my weight, but I want to loose the last rings around my belly. 

My problem is, I'm a runner, but currently I hate running, I'm getting sick from muscle training and I can't get my nutrition right. Yes, I have a sweet tooth, I fight it constantly, but sometimes I give in, without gaining weight. 

I watch my calory intake as good as I can, do sports (without fun since weeks) but nothing changes. I'm also in a lot of stress right now (family, relationship, work, university) and sick of it all and not achieving my goal... 

What can I do? I wanted to achieve my goal until the end of the year. I thought it reasonable in january, but now I'm in doubt.

Sorry for more venting, then asking... what would you do? Do I lack discipline? I never did in anything in my life..."
