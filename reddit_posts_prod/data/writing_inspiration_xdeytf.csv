I have no inspiration,mr-mwah,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/xdeytf/i_have_no_inspiration/,19,9,"I don't know what to write for my novel anymore. I'm on chapter 14 and all my ideas just went, ""poof."" I still write so it's not an issue with motivation, but I don't know how to continue the story from where I'm at. I don't know what situations to put the characters in or a way to advance the plot in the long run.

I already have a few future chapters planned out, but I've just hit a rut. What do I do?"
