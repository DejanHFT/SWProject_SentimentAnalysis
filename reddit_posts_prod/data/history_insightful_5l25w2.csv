I found a deed that's dated 1713 and is in great condition. Can someone offer any insight into what I should do with it? (gallery),porcelain_toenail,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5l25w2/i_found_a_deed_thats_dated_1713_and_is_in_great/,24,86,"http://imgur.com/a/4PjWJ

I came across this a while back and often thought about taking it to a museum to get some information about it, but never got round to it. Maybe you guys can offer me some insight!

For something that's over 300 years old, I reckon it's in pretty good knick. The paper is rough, so maybe it's sheep skin or something similar? All the writing and 'art' (for lack of a better word?) is hand drawn in ink and it has been done rather beautifully. Very pleasing to the eye! However I can't really understand much of the content as it's written in a much older variation of english than what I'm used to haha. 

So r/history, is this anything special? Anything of value? Should I even have it?? 

Some answers would be greatly appreciated :-) "
