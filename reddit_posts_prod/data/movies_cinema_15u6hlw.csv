"Cinephiles of reddit, at what age did you start to really get into cinema?",Chafec1er_strich355,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/15u6hlw/cinephiles_of_reddit_at_what_age_did_you_start_to/,421,139,"When would you say you started to become more serious movie buff? 

Perhaps taking it more seriously as an artform? Ok maybe not necessarily as an artform that you thoroughly analyze, but at least something more than just a pastime you do without thinking that much about it. 

And what movie(s) made you 'catch the bug' so to speak? What was the turning point, if you could call it that?

Bonus because why not: who's your favorite living director?"
