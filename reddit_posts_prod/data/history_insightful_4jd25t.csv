How did Nazi Germany refer to its enemies?,Ducks_Eat_Bread,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/4jd25t/how_did_nazi_germany_refer_to_its_enemies/,31,83,"I heard once that the Nazis viewed the Soviets and Americans/English as ""Jewish"" controlled forces. I'm sure they didn't refer to them ""The Allies."" Could anyone add some further insight into this please? I'm not looking for nicknames like ""Yanks"" or ""Tommys""."
