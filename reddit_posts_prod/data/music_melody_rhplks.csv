Just Look Up melody by Ariana Grande,occyycco,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/rhplks/just_look_up_melody_by_ariana_grande/,13,6,"I just came back from a screening of Don’t Look Up and noticed a major melodic similarity between Ariana’s song and Greatest Love of All by Whitney Houston and also The Power of Love by Celine Dion.

The line “then just one look is all it takes, I feel your eyes they’re locked on every part of me” is almost identical to “I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone’s shadow” from Greatest Love Of All.

And then her segue into the chorus as well as the beginning of the chorus when she says “and then my dumb heart says… just look upppp” sounds exactly like “a love that I could not forsake … cause I’m your ladyyyyy” from The Power of Love.

Did anyone else pick up on this? I know Ariana is a big fan of Whitney and Celine and she wrote this song so it makes sense."
