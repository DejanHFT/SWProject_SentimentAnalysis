Where do you draw the line between comfort and adventure when you travel?,Sn00ker123,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15j2vj7/where_do_you_draw_the_line_between_comfort_and/,106,93,"I found learnt a very painful lesson for my ego when traveling South America this year. I really thought I'd love travelling any way any how but it's simply not true anymore. I now want good food, private rooms, comfy buses etc and am now basically moving over to van life moving forward because it's just more comfortable. 

Where do you draw the line? Do you think affording yourself some luxuries compromises the experience?"
