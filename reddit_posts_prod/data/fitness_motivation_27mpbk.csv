Advice on motivating my girlfriend to work out..,MojoLava,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/27mpbk/advice_on_motivating_my_girlfriend_to_work_out/,93,73,"Firstly I've never pressure my girlfriend into working out. It'd appear that my diet and lifestyle have inspired her to become healthier 

She'd like to lose some weight, but lapses back into periods of unhealthiness that are hindering her process and causing her to become highly discouraged. 

The advice I've given so far is that she shouldn't think of it as trying to lose weight but rather making herself healthier, the benefits of which are enormous. 

Last week she joined a yoga class, not really sure what kind if activity that is, but I imagine it's helping her flexibility and such. On top of that I recommended HIIT. But now she's enormously sore after her first day and believes she can't work through it. 

I've suggested 1-2 cheat meals a week to keep up moral, and provided nothing but encouragement. ""I don't care what you look like, you're always beautiful, but I love that you're being healthy"" or something like that. 
However, she seems to be suffering from really wanting to do nothing and eating. 

Tl;dr Having trouble keeping my girlfriend motivated to workout/maintain a healthy diet. How could I keep her spirits up?

Edit: Thank you everyone for the advice! Excited to try some stuff out, love this sub. Thanks again! "
