Instantly remembering melodies? Common?,akara211,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/wrp273/instantly_remembering_melodies_common/,5,1,"Hi,
While I was learning a new song on guitar and trying to get my friends to sing along, I'd noticed that I could remember the melodies to a certain song instantly in order to sing it (not hearing it before), but my friends needed helluva lot repeats to remember it in order to get the melody in their heads to sing it. What does this tell bout me and them?"
