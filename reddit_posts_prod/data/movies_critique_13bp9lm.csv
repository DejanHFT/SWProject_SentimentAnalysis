Why do people think Barbie is going to satirize/critique capitalism?,gamecollecting2,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/13bp9lm/why_do_people_think_barbie_is_going_to/,40,13,"Firstly - yes Greta Gerwig is a good director/writer. But the movie is bankrolled by Mattel. I’ve seen people saying the movie will “satirize capitalism” and serve as some overall self-critique. Inherently, this will be (edit: in part) a toy commercial. It might be well-written, well-directed toy commercial, but Mattel would not bankroll a Barbie movie unless it had promise to increase sales, and certainly not one which would critique capitalism. If they do, they’re working against their own interests. My guess is it will be comparable to the Lego Movie - a fun movie on its own merits but also a way to sell more Lego products. The 2001 reference in the trailer really doesn’t point to anything more than pop culture references which have been done to death. I’m sure there will be some self-awareness of the silliness of the project, and maybe it will even be good, but I think peoples’ hopes are way too high. What are other peoples' thoughts?

Edit: Also, already have a deal set up with Gap to release a line of merchandise a day before the movie comes out. [Source.](https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/gap-mattel-product-collaborations-barbie-hot-wheels-1235620016/)

Edit 2: Also, I could be wrong. Genuinely interested in others’ perspectives."
