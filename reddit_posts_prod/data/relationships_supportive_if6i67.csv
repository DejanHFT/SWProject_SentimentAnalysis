My long term boyfriend seems to think that me being supportive of his decisions equates to me actually helping with them,yummyyummybunny,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/if6i67/my_long_term_boyfriend_seems_to_think_that_me/,21,8,"This is a recurring issue in our relationship (32F 34M) which overall has trended towards good (we have a kid together so while there were red flags I wish I'd taken into higher regard when we started dating, I'm hoping for advice on how to handle this on an ongoing basis rather than hearing about how this is a red flag). When he's calm and we can talk, this isn't a problem, but in the heat of the moment this keeps triggering something on his side and it's not tenable.

Probably every few months, he needs to make decisions around things like his company, his kids (previous marriage), his therapy, his weekend projects, whatever. Invariably, regardless of me being generally encouraging or straight up blunt about it being his decision and to keep me out of it (always letting him know that while it's his reasonability I will of course be supportive), it quickly turns to an argument over his expectations that I'm going to help him in some way. Even where I've been very blunt and told him I'm not interested in helping or going to, it will come out (usually as I'm trying to talk about something that IS supposed to be a shared reasonability, like our kid) that I agreed to be supportive and he can't do everything.

Obviously (to me) this is a boundaries and expectations  issue--me saying ""I support you [emotionally] and respect whatever decision you make about this thing you need to decide"" is not something I really want to change, because I think that's a pretty core part of relationships. I could just start saying ""I don't support you in this"" but I tried that (with work, he'd agreed to find another job after another six months if it didn't work, with me doing way too much at home to support him trying to ""level up"" where he was--a year and change later after trying to talk about it for months I finally snapped and told him he was on his own and I flat out did not support the decision anymore because he'd cut me out of it and still expected me to keep doing the extra shit) and it didn't really change the outcome.

This is obviously untenable--I'm at the point where I look around and every ""project"" or thing we're directly working on is something that his, and my own projects either lie abandoned or something we fight about on a weekly basis (tell me it's not grating as any mother to be the only one aware of when the toddler wakes up or naps or needs to eat, and the only one getting her up if she starts to sleep too long or goes too long without a snack). He is genuinely under the impression that all of his stuff are ""ours"" things because he brought them to me to ask for support.

Most recently this has come to a head with his kids, where he made a decision to move forward on a custody lawsuit (mom's been purposefully sabotaging their medical access). He made it clear that he wouldn't be moving forward on it if not for me and I made it clear that that was a terrible reason and that he shouldn't move forward on it if it's for me--it should either be for the kids or not at all (I did agree with him that it was a huge source of stress and that I supported whatever decision he made around it).

Fast forward to today (two weeks later) and we got into a row over me not wanting to be on an initial call with a lawyer (fighting a ""your kid isn't disabled"" decision at the school because they broke all of the federal testing criteria and have her accommodations that allowed her to perform well for the testing). I've got the same info he has, and while I think it's important to get her help, I stepped back on trying to over parent about a year and a half ago--it's not my burden to try to fix although it is one that I'm happy to do more research and work on than most of these projects. But, me not wanting to be on this initial call was enough to make him snap and start saying that I couldn't use ""I'm not her mother"" as an excuse anymore and that he was cancelling it because if I'd wanted him to do it then he shouldn't have done the lawsuit because he didn't have time.


Now, obvious shortcomings aside, I genuinely just want to live a life where both of us feel supported. But I don't feel supported, because 1. he's so overwhelmed and busy that none of my projects are things I think make sense to even ask for, and 2. our single shared responsibilities (our daughter and our house) are mostly shoved onto me unless it's a project I can get him interested in (he'd be furious that I'm claiming to ""do the most"" on the house, but the reality is that the maintenance is largely managed by me unless it's an emergency or a project that he wants to do. Lawn care and snow plowing, finding someone to clear out the weeds from the landscaping because he wanted to spend his weekends installing a garden and a trampoline for the kids, ordering parts for the water heater that blew, finding someone to come install a new HVAC when we first moved in, finding and scheduling a plumber when one of the pipes got clogged, ordering zip it things for the shower drain when they got backed up (yeah mostly with my hair but it was being managed by me clearing it out as I showered, which he complained constantly about, until his got long enough to also clog it up and he saw what I was preventing).

And he doesn't feel supported, I think because he thinks that me saying ""I support you"" means that I'm accepting shared reasonability in every decision he makes simply because we're together and he's given me the chance to voice an opinion.

Again, once he calms down and we talk, things are good and he's able to understand that we had a miscommunication or bad expectations, but this is exhausting because I have to essentially be purposefully drawing really hard boundaries on ""supportiveness"" because of his default expectations. My frustration around it is at an all time high because on MY side I'm flat out offended at this point that he thinks I'm going to take on his shit all the time when he's not taking on anything of mine (I about snapped at the ""you can't use you not being their mom as an excuse"" thing because it's something I've made really fucking clear that I am not his default primary parent to his kids just because he's overwhelmed--I'm already overwhelmed and frustrated by how much I'm stuck doing it with our OWN kid, we went from me trying to help with his to essentially doing the same primary parent shit I do with ours, and I drew a hard line on it after too much time with no change--they're 100% his responsibility unless he asks for specific help that I want to agree to and I refuse to take on anything around it by default. That was a hard boundary to draw on my end but it had to be done).

Ahhhhh. Direction? Guidance?

He's been going to therapy the last yearish and it's finally started helping the last few months which has been great, but there's years of bad habits built up here between us at this point and I would love some shortcuts on dumping the negative relationship habits as he continues to grow in that (and doing some of my own growing as I was at the point where I was going to leave at the beginning of the year before he suddenly changed how he was communicating, so finally working through this now instead of getting to just walk away is honestly sometimes very hard)."
