About inspiration...,Prince_Zinar,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/kxkxeo/about_inspiration/,4,3,"Is it bad to get inspiration from places like Artstation or Pinterest? (Maybe even music)

I've done this for years (I don't write profesionally just to be clear) but it's not until now that it dawned on me that this might be bad thing to do since it's not my art nor my characters.

I always do it because I'm not an artist and I like to get some kind of visual reference when I'm writing but I would like to know from an external source that probably know better than any of my friends.

Also, maybe I'll make more questions here since I've been struggling a lot lately to the point that I don't know if I wanna keep writing or not."
