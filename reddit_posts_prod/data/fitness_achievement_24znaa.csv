Can't achieve pec soreness or gains,GDandT,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/24znaa/cant_achieve_pec_soreness_or_gains/,11,0,"Can you achieve soreness in your pecs post workout?  If so, describe what chest exercises you do that really work.

I am frustrated with my performance gains in bench, and I think it is related to that every time I do a chest workout I never have soreness build-up like when I get done with my other muscle group workouts.  Follow up question, is muscle soreness correlated to a successful workout?

A typical workout for me on chest would be:

* Flat Bench:   6 sets of 5-8 reps
* Inclined Bench:   3 sets of 5-8 reps
* Cable Flies:   3 sets w/ low cables 3 sets w/ high cables and 5-8 reps
* Dumbbell Flies:  3-6 sets and 5-8 reps
* Push Ups:     Push till burn out

I know it is important to keep a good variety of different exercises in your workout routine, however, I've never got chest down right.  I don't have a gym buddy to give me a spot (sometimes can grab a stray fellow) so I rarely can do barbell till exhaustion, this is why the flies and push ups are at the back side of my routine.

Some things about me: I'm 5'5 150lbs and about 5-10% body fat.  

* Squat: 320 5 reps
* Bench: 185 5 reps, used to be able to do 225 up to 3 reps
* PT Pullups: 20

I have been a moderate gym goer for the last 11 years with my fair share of ups and downs of physical fitness.  I am tired of not being at my best in bench and want to get up to 250lb 3 rep bench press.  

Thanks for any suggestions.  First real Reddit post btw."
