Explore one way flights from anywhere to a set destination,ChiefCrazybull,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/14iof8b/explore_one_way_flights_from_anywhere_to_a_set/,6,0,"Hi everyone! I know there's a bunch of ways to find round trip or even one way flights from a specific destination to anywhere in the world. But is the opposite possible? For example, let's say I'm in Europe and want to return home to Miami in 2 weeks. I'm flexible with travel plans and would be willing to go to pretty much any city for a weekend before flying home. Is there a way to search one way flights from every European city to Miami for a specific day? 

Thanks for any help!"
