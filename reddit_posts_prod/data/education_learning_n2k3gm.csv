"When will we acknowledge that teachers don't know and have not been taught ""how we learn"".",rmurphe,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/n2k3gm/when_will_we_acknowledge_that_teachers_dont_know/,90,0,"I have been working up to this for years, and now am finally asking the question.   Most teachers have no idea about ""how we learn"".   Even teachers with master's degrees, in general, don't learn these things in school.  Even those who do, it seems to get drained out of them once they get into teaching.   

One part of this I think is that to really understand this you need to have some education in psychology, child development, and neuroscience.   Another reason is that there is a secret divide between academic studies into how we learn, and what is taught in teacher's college.    For example, the medical profession is a great example of how this ""generally"" works really well.  But teaching is on the opposite end of the spectrum but most educators don't even know it.   This is why pseudo science is rampant in teaching.   

These things are at the heart of our flawed education system but are generally glossed over, ignored, or unknown.  I wanted to put it out there.

Edit: I love the responses.  This was the purpose. What I feel I am missing is specificity.  When I talk about “ how we learn” I am talking about specific ideas that have been well studied and have lots of value in informing teachers and learners about learning.   

For example: 

Working memory and how we best access it. 

How long term memory best connects to working memory.  

How we best understand schema and assimilation and accommodation in connection to internal biases

Why retrieval practice ( testing) spacing and interleaving work best for retention and recall of knowledge.  

How different types of memories work together to help us learn

What metacognition is and why it is so important to learning and breaking illusions of knowledge. 

These are things I’d love to discuss."
