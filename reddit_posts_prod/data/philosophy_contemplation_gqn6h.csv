I offer kudos in return. This isn't for a class, it's for my life and yours. I'm trying to help save us all.

I.  Why
     A.  Death is non-awareness
          a.  Information processing center (brain) stops
          b.  Naturally occurring human temporality; approximate lifespan 75 years
     B.  Death is currently unknown (not necessarily “better” or “worse”)
          a.  Death unknown from 1st person perspective
          b.  Slow ventures into death (1 minute, 1 hour, 1 week, 1 month, etc.)
          c.  Coma patients
     C. The nature of “should”: one should not treat the unknown exactly like the known
II.  How
     A.  Suspended Animation
          a.  Brain
          b.  Full Body
          c.  Body-matter conversion/deconstruction, storage and reconstruction
     B.  Live Repair/Reconstruction

Why

Death is non-awareness. When we die we stop processing information and we no longer respond to stimulus. The activities of our brain and the rest of our nervous system cease. We see nothing, smell nothing, hear nothing, taste nothing, analyze nothing, interpret nothing and understand nothing. We experience nothing; we are not aware. “We” still exist as tissues, cells, molecules, atoms, subatomic particles, mass and various forms of energy and heat, but we are no longer aware. We, as conscious organisms, are dead. Soon, I may die.

I am 26 years old. If I do nothing to effectively halt the natural aging process, and if everyone else remains likewise unmoved, then I will die in about 50 years. To ignore this looming problem is to passively invite and embrace my own death; it means trading a known awareness for an unknown non-awareness. It seems to me my most important problem. Without intervention my death is all but certain, and I do not want to die.

I do not want to die because I do not know death from a first-person perspective, and neither does anyone else. I do not know what it is to be unable to process information for a colossal amount of time. If we learn to resuscitate people who have been “dead” and preserved for days, weeks, months or years then we can begin to understand death from a first-person perspective; until then death remains an unknown and irreversible condition of non-awareness. A comatose person appears dead in many ways and their experience could be similar to a dead person’s “experience”, but the two conditions are not identical. The experience of being comatose is, at best, an approximation of death. Death is not known. Knowing neither death nor extended non-awareness, I avoid them. I avoid them like an unfamiliar territory into which I contemplate a patient, cautious approach that I hope to never actually take. I do not plan to die.

I began seriously contemplating immortality when I attempted to answer the following question: What should I do next? There are an infinite number of actions I CAN take, and choosing any particular action over another action is arbitrary without a system under which to judge the action. For example, the choice “Should I eat or not eat?” is an arbitrary decision outside of the following system: One must eat to avoid the pain of hunger and to live, and avoiding the pain of hunger is “good”, and living is the “right” thing to do. Without this system, what does it matter whether or not one chooses to eat? Systems like this can be constructed for any decision anyone might make, and without these systems the designations “right” and “wrong” and “should” quickly vanish. The most supreme system—which we all appear to share—is existence, and we are aware of it through our conscious existence. Any decision I make while conscious is ultimately predicated on my continued conscious existence. If I choose to eat it is to continue my conscious existence. If I choose to sleep it is to rest in preparation for my continued conscious existence. If I choose to worship it is the result of believing there is a powerful entity interacting with me and my conscious existence—whatever form it may take—now and in the future. If I choose to have fun it is to make my conscious existence more interesting as I maintain it. It appears to me the most supreme system is existence, and the most supreme choice I have—a choice I must necessarily make daily—is: Should I consciously participate in existence? It seems to me that every choice I can possibly make can only be made in favor of continuing my conscious participation in existence...all choices but one. The only choice that wouldn’t continue my conscious existence would be a choice to end my conscious existence by embracing death. Every moment from my birth to the present I have encountered the same conundrum: By participating in conscious existence every day I am alive, I temporarily choose awareness over death; but if I accept aging and my limited life expectancy—about 70 years—I willfully choose ignorance and eventually death. I offer a simple remedy for this discrepancy: I do not choose ignorance and death. I choose to fight my limited life expectancy. I seek immortality.


How

By “immortality” I mean the indefinite extension of consciousness/awareness. When I write “indefinite” I mean as far as possible into the foreseeable, conceivable future. When considering methods of achieving this kind of immortality it is important to remember three basic principles. First, for something to be physically possible it must be logically possible. Second, just because something is logically possible does not mean you can assert with absolute certainty that it is physically possible. And finally, just because something is physically possible does not mean it is physically inevitable. I can think of three ways to achieve immortality, each of them logically possible and perhaps physically possible: Suspended Animation, Live Body Maintenance/Repair and Brain Transplantation.

By “suspended animation” I mean preservation of a live organism in a non-responsive but physiologically reversible state. An example would be freezing and thawing if each could be done without extensive, irreversible tissue/organ damage. Conscious awareness is a function of the nervous and endocrine systems, which means to preserve consciousness you need not preserve the entire human body but only the brain and some auxiliary structures if saving these is the only immediately feasible solution. If the entire body can be saved it should be saved; if only the structures necessary for consciousness can be saved, they should be saved. Suspended animation could mean converting the brain/body to a form of mass/energy more convenient for storage. This conversion-storage-reconstruction process would have to ensure no essential energy/mass/information is lost or damaged irreparably.

By “live body maintenance/repair” I simply mean repairing and maintaining the body at as many levels as necessary and/or possible, from the whole organism down through organ systems, tissues, cells and smaller structures. This is business as usual for most physicians, but with the added, explicit goal of extending indefinitely at first the structures necessary for conscious awareness, and eventually the entire body. Until the entire body can be perpetually repaired/maintained the brain and auxiliary structures necessary for consciousness could be kept functioning outside of an otherwise deteriorated body via an artificial life support system.

“Brain transplantation” would require cultivating bodies and physically transferring a fully functioning brain from a dying body into a healthy body, effectively eliminating the death of consciousness/awareness as long healthy bodies can be cultivated.

Of these three methods, which is the most promising? Suspended animation isn’t really a solution but a delay. It doesn’t solve aging/death but instead preserves an organism in preparation for a solution to death/aging that might be discovered in near future—near enough that the life form can be revived. Preservation is presently attainable, though one cannot be certain a person has been preserved in the proper condition to allow for revival in the future using some unknown future method. Live body maintenance/repair is the most thorough as it directly addresses and fixes the problems of aging/death and it is also the least controversial because it’s business as usual for most physicians. Brain transplantation is the most ethically questionable method because it requires creating a form of life for the sole purpose of housing a brain, and it also does not directly solve death/aging but merely transfers structures necessary for consciousness from a dying body into a healthy body. The maintenance/repair method seems to me the farthest from practical realization, but also the most thorough, while suspended animation seems closest to practical realization.

There may be other methods to achieve the kind of immortality here discussed, but these three broad categories are all I can independently conceive. I would be surprised to find a method that falls outside these three categories or that is not a result of combining two or more of these categories. Solving the physical problems associated with each of these methods requires integrating a range of studies and professions, but I’m comfortable grouping these methods under the label “biotechnology” and “biotechnology research”. It seems to me a form of biotechnology research is the most likely path to immortality."
