Any such thing as well rounded fitness competitions?,kiljoy1569,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/a7nw7h/any_such_thing_as_well_rounded_fitness/,6,0,"Similar in spirit to things like Strongman or CrossFit games, but testing/scoring for well rounded fitness with well defined standards.

For example: Testing for 1RM on bench, deadlift, squats but also max reps on pullups(strict), dips, testing a 1 mile run time, etc.  Taking some widely acceptable  tests for strength, stamina, speed as individual events (not wods or combined) then cumulating all scores?"
