"Being fit is sleeping well, right?",Conman93,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/kowiy/being_fit_is_sleeping_well_right/,32,25,"So I don't know anywhere else to ask this, but how do I get better sleep?  All summer I've been pulling all nighters, and I've gotten used to it.  Now school rolls around and I can't get back on schedule.  Any tips? 

Thanks in advance Fittit, you're awesome. "
