"New to practical astronomy, any advice is greatly appreciated.",TomBroccoli7,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/kkiog6/new_to_practical_astronomy_any_advice_is_greatly/,9,4,"So I've loved space for a long time and am quite knowledgeable on planetary science + astrophysics. But I haven't had my own telescope before.
I got a telescope with my family and I was just wondering what I'd expect to see through it.
Here are the specs:
-700mm focal length (F/12)
-60mm aperture 
-Two eyepieces, one 20mm (35x) - 1.25"" eyepiece, and one 10mm (70x) - 1.25"" eyepiece

Cheers"
