"Studying education, learning and teaching - where to start?",Lieto,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/14fxjex/studying_education_learning_and_teaching_where_to/,2,2,"Hi r/education! I'm a cognitive scientist with theoretical background in decision making. I got interested in learning through my hobbies, and I'm looking for ways to incorporate that interest in an academic context (possibly a doctoral thesis, if the stars align). However, my knowledge base on the academic study of pedagogical topics is quite narrow, and I'm a bit usure on where to start doing background research. So I came here, I hope you can help me!

What I'm looking for is a good source (book or article) on the history of pedagogy/pedagogical theory, as well as on the current paradigms and what is considered the ""latest knowledge"" on the field. What do researchers of education base their theories and research on? Which topics have been studied to death, and what are the current questions being asked?

Also, any article recommendations are very welcome, and, as I'm not entirely familiar with the relevant vocabulary, keyword suggestions for finding relevant stuff on Google Scholar would be awesome!

Also also, if this is not the best place for asking this, would you mind directing me to somewhere more appropriate? Thank you in advance!"
