"[UPDATE] BF (30 M) of two years won't do anything (including shower) without my suggestion.

Thanks to everyone who commented on the original post. It blew up way bigger than I expected! I appreciated reading all the different opinions and experiences.


Many people commented saying I should move out and let him live life on his own for a while, regardless of whether or not we broke up, and of course, EVERYONE agreed he needs therapy like, yesterday.


Well, the Talk happened sooner than I expected. He had been quiet the last couple of days and last night, he said he wanted to talk about something. He said he was having nightmares about his last relationship and had been pretty depressed. So I took the opportunity to tell him I thought it was time he seriously considered therapy. He burst into tears and agreed with me. 


He said he had balked at it before because he doesn't want to talk about some of the horrible things that had happened to him (naturally). But he agreed that it was preventing our relationship from progressing. He admitted that, in trying to close off his ""bad feelings"" he was closing himself off from us too, and not engaging enough in life. And he surprised me further by saying that he also planned to cut down his internet activity and focus more on his work and on real-life activity. I had no complaints about our quality time before, but he said he felt like he needed to practice being more present.


Now I'm going to tell on myself: I discovered I have indeed been ""mothering"" him, although not in the way I thought. So, I also brought up the hygiene problem and said how it had not improved and how unhappy I was about it. A lot of commenters said I needed to be more explicit, so I tried to explain exactly how bad it had gotten...and *I* burst into tears! I found it almost impossible to tell him directly how bad he smelled. I finally choked it out and said, ""I can smell you across the room!"" He got it.


I discovered that I've been trying too hard to protect his feelings. I didn't want to hurt him, and I **especially** didn't want him to associate me with the women who had shamed him in his past. But I guess I wasn't helping anybody. 


I cried and I said I was sorry. He said, ""You have nothing to apologize for. You're right. I don't want you to be uncomfortable around me."" I said in my OP that I suspected it was a guilt/shame/depression spiral, and I was right. He confirmed that he knew his hygiene was awful, and the worse he felt about it, the more depressed he got, and the less likely he was to want to take a shower. He also confirmed that he felt like a worthless person and that he deserved to feel bad. (And also agreed again at this point in the convo that therapy was long overdue.)


He surprised me again by saying that he had decided to start calendaring his showers on his phone (before I suggested it, based on some commenters' suggestions). We talked about ways to make it seem less intimidating, like starting with every other day, or showering every day but not a full shower every time, so long as he got his cock'n'balls done every time. 


We talked about a lot of stuff, but ultimately, he wants our relationship to succeed and we love each other enough to keep trying. We'll call the local mental health clinic on Monday, and I **will** hold him to it. I feel pretty confident though that he'll grit his teeth and go through with it. Should he still have some time living alone? Probably. But neither one of us are ready or strong enough to do that. It's a last resort option, and hopefully one we won't have to use.


Tl;dr Kid gloves are off, therapy is on. Wish us luck!"
