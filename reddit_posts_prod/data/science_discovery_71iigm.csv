"Science AMA Series: We are a group pf researchers that uses the MMO game Eve Online to identify Exoplanets in telescope data, we're Project Discovery: Exoplanets, Ask us Anything!",PD-Exoplanets,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/71iigm/science_ama_series_we_are_a_group_pf_researchers/,570,10390,"We are the team behind Project Discovery - Exoplanets, a joint effort of Wolf Prize Winner Michel Mayor’s team at University of Geneva, CCP Games, Massively Multiplayer Online Science (MMOS), and the University of Reykjavik. We successfully integrated a huge set of light data gathered from the CoRoT telescope into the massively multiplayer game EVE Online in order to allow players to help identify possible exoplanets through consensus. EVE players have made over 38.3 million classifications of light data which are being sent back to University of Geneva to be further verified, making the project remains one of the largest and most participated in citizen science efforts, peaking at over 88,000 per hour. This is the second version of Project Discovery, the first of which was a collaboration of the Human Protein Atlas to classify human proteins for scientific research.
Joining today are


  *   Wayne Gould, Astronomer with a Master’s degree in Physics and Astrophysics who has been working at the Geneva Observatory since January and is responsible to prepare and upload all data used in the project


  *   Attila Szantner, Founder and CEO of Massively Multiplayer Online Science (http://mmos.ch/) Who founded the company in order to connect scientific research and video games as a seamless gaming experience.


  *   Hjalti Leifsson, Software Engineer from CCP Games, part of the team who is involved in integrating the data into EVE Online


We’d love to answer questions about our respective areas of expertise, the search for exoplanets, citizen science (leveraging human brain power to tackle data where software falls short), developing a citizen science platform within a video game, how to pick science tasks for citizen science, and more.

EDIT---WRAPPED UP
 Thanks to all of you for your questions, it has been a great experience hearing from the players side. Once again a big thanks to all of you who have participated in the project and made the effort of preparing all this data worth it. ~Wayne
Thank you all for the interesting questions. It was my first Reddit AMA - was pretty intensive, and I loved it. And thanks for the amazing contributions in Project Discovery. ~Attila
Thanks to the r/science mods and everyone who asked questions and has contributed to Project Discovery with classifications! We're happy we can do this sort of thing FOR SCIENCE ~Hjalti and the CCP team.
