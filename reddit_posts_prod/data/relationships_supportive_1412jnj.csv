"M31 Not sure if I’m being supportive, or exploited or something awkward and in between with gf f29 but either way feel like im on the edge of collapse",Apprehensive_Bus3852,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1412jnj/m31_not_sure_if_im_being_supportive_or_exploited/,3,0,"TLDR I am in a relationship which has got very onsided (i do everything financially, emotionally, practicality/chores) while my girlfriend keeps getting more angry with me for small things no matter what i try to the point where i get depressed and even feel a bit unsafe at home. My girlfriend has been going through hell so I have tried to be understanding, but shes not open to trying to change things and i am not sure how much longer i keep trying as its breaking my mental health. But I still really care about her and don't want to leave her without support so feel trapped and unsure what to do  
I feel a bit strange posting here at my age but feeling really lost it could do with some advice.  
  
First a bit of background.  
  
I am a m32, and have been dating my girlfriend f29 (gf), for coming up to a year, we both live in London.  
  
There’s a bit of important background for both of us first.  
  
I had some really big health (including depression) and career headaches (all sorted now and I’m generally in a very good place in both ) so coupled with the pandemic vaporising two years, I’ve had about five years off from being in (and not really seeking out) relationships, so I both feel a bit rusty and to be honest and within anxious about getting older (I do want to have a family/settle down).  
  
Gf has had a really tough time her previous relationship was quite badly abusive and when I met her (which I didn’t know originally) she was staying in a women’s shelter.  
  
I’m autistic so sometimes I don’t read social cues and the best way (although I have a decent circle of friends I’m in senior managerial job, I do get by okay but I know it’s not always my biggest strength), I’m about 99% sure gf is as well (not diagnosed which shows a lot of the traits and is of a mind that she probably has herself as well).  
  
And onto the conundrum sorry this is a very long, having read these threads before I know people often miss out important information so I’m trying to be fair but that also means ends up as a bit of a wall of text.  
  
I met gf on a dating website, where she had down as her career, that she did a bit of freelance website design and some translation work (we are both in the UK she is not from the UK originally and does speak a really impressive collection of languages). We started talking online and got on really well. This was odd for me as I tend to take quite a long time to figure if I like someone but we both seem to hit it off pretty much immediately. When we met in person I did realise she was in quite a lot of the worst state then I first thought and she shared (after some gentle prodding) she had been unemployed for a while, has gone out of an abusive relationship, and was in effectively a womens shelter, and was clearly suffering from quite bad depression (I’ve had depression myself and know what a nightmare it can be).  
  
Hearing about the really tough time she had for the last few years absolutely broke my heart and while it wasn’t what I would he planned this point I’d already caught feelings so made it clear I appreciated she has some ship to get through I was happy to take things slowly and carefully and I wanted to be there to try and help.  
  
One of the problem she mentioned was her room was uninhabitable a hot during the summer (we are about to hit a record heat wave) it was clearly really worrying her so I decided to offer to let her stay over at my house during the heatwave (I do have a spare room) while stressing there were no particular expectations from doing so. She agreed came over and I basically spent a long weekend trying to do all the things I felt was missing out on and honestly it was wonderful she got out of her shell we got really close really quickly at the end of the long weekend we properly kissed (as in more then a peck on the cheek) and agreed we were going to try and build something together. The first few months were honestly the best relationship I’d ever had. We have the same interests, she seemed really interested in building a life together, and generally we seem to gel incredibly well . I knew she was in a really crappy place but she was really clear she wanted to get back on her feet was really appreciative of me trying to help a bit with that (we did things like yours at all a user works to help people plan the next steps in their career to figure out what she could do to get a good job). I was paying for the dates (unsurprisingly and happily) but she assured me that what she was getting as benefits was enough to get by day-to-day, and long term she did not want to have to depend on anyone, so I didn’t really intervene more than that.  
  
But then around last winter (so about 4-5 months in) things really started to change. She previously said she wanted to start looking for work after Christmas (she was originally going to be on her own over Christmas so I invited her over to me and my mums). But she was having real trouble starting to look into making applications she lost her computer (I think in the prior abusive relationship), so she was having to go into the library and often couldn’t get a device I could see was really upset about this and hatered how sad it made her, so I talked about it with her and agreed to get her a laptop as a slightly early Christmas present. I should point out a bit about my financial situation here stop I’m in a relatively senior role in a charity I make a good deal more than the national average but I’ve also got, a rather big mortgage (which massively spiked with the increase in interest rates), so I get by certainly don’t have to worry about getting food on the table but spare money is quite tight. So finding the cash for a decent, laptop was a fairly big deal and more or less drained my reserves (especially given of course I’ve been paying double for all the dates etc). Gf knew I was worrying a lot about money especially after the interest rate hike and seemed really understanding and very thankful for the laptop.  
  
But then out of the blue she started talking about trying to apply to go back to uni next year instead of looking for work, she seemed to assume I’d cover the costs for the full three years! I tried to explain calmly and quietly I could not commit to that (after all complete financial responsibility for someone for years is very different to paying for a few meals out), and she got really angry and upset. We had our first really serious fight. But the next day she seemed better pretty much simultaneously came up with a mutual solution (she could look at applying for degree apprenticeship or similar which should mean should be bring enough cash in that it wouldn’t cause me to bigger financial headache even though I would still be doing most of the heavy lifting (which i would be okay with i can do most of it jsut not all long term) and it seemed like things had been resolved).  
  
But ever since then she suddenly getting angry with me about the strangest things.  
  
January came and went she missed the deadline to apply for courses and didn’t start looking for work when I brought up uni deadline and said I was happy to help with paperwork (something she expressed interest in before) she again got really angry with me, and accuse me of trying to force her to do what I want to/fit into a box for my interests. I made it really clear that I’m not too fussed what she does (e.g. she’s talked to a lot of different types of work lots of different types of uni etc) and she is happy with the understanding that I can’t commit to being completely financially responsible for someone else for years given my current financial situation (but I am in a comfortable enough position I can do most of the heavy lifting), but again she got really angry with me and so to say I don’t care about her. I explained I care about her massively and I do everything I can to try and help through I know is a really crap time and then she said this was me trying to blackmail her by doing nice things then creates an obligation for her to do nice things for me which she said isn’t fair…..  
  
I was a bit lost for words as to be honest doing nice things just what I assume once you do for one’s partner! At this point I asked if she really wants to keep going she sounded like she really dislikes me but she said she did. I know sometimes when people are depressed say things they don’t mean and I try to keep muddling along.  
  
A bit after that she went from staying at my house/in my spare room occasionally to pretty much constantly; and I slowly found her financial situation was a lot worse than I thought (she wasn’t affording enough to eat at her room and because of fees and some old debts she basely had no money coming through). Once I realised how bad it was I did offer to help out a little bit and have been giving her a couple of hundred pounds a month to cover necessities (while she’s staying at my mine most of the time so I was largely covering food anyway). Which was doable but again quite a strain in my current financial circumstances (at this point with everything else and higher food bills she’s pretty much all my discretionary spending)  
  
Every now and again we’d link up like we used to and it would be brilliant and still me of those good days and It would remind how much I care about her but as time goes on she’s just getting more and more angry with me about the smallest of things and the good times have hot rarer. She still not looking for work (I’ve not been particularly pushing as I know she gets really worried when people push), and she’s even stopped helping out with basic cleaning when staying over (I’d say initially we were 50-50 now it’s 90/10). At the same time she keeps getting angry with me about the smallest things accusing me of being controlling, not caring for what just seems like normal everyday things.  
  
A recent example was we’d been having a fairly separate day (I have some work to do over the weekend she was feeling unwell), I came down and we watched tv for a bit (I had got a new tv having not had one in my place before as when she was down she liked to binge watch). I tried to pause it manually to say something and she used the remote instead i commented it was amusing how little i know about how to use my tv as i rarely use it and she got very angry about me using the word my instead of our as this apparently meanti was treating her like a guest who could be kickd out at any time and did not care about her. It then took hours to calm her down after this  
  
At the same time she has stopped showing any real affection for me (which has now been a case for about six months) something I used to really like about relationship was how close we were physically, but she stopped showing any real interest even in holding hands or cuddling on the sofa. I explained I was finding this really difficult she said it was and that should work on but then quickly step back into complete disengaging. I did ask if there’s something I could do to help, or if there was anything I was doing wrong and beyond listing whatever she was most recently angry with me about. And it’s not just about physical intimacy is also emotional intimacy when my birthday happened she’d did not even whish me happy birthday or try and do anything for the day, the other weekend when I had a really bad experience work that may be scared I was going to lose my job (I did not and it was fine in the end), and I came down to the sitting room and said I was feeling really vulnerable and scared (and clearly needed a bit of emtional support) she just said it should be fine and she didn’t understand why I was interrupting a television show.  
  
So all in all I feel like I’m doing all the emotional labour, all the actual work, and I’m not getting any support back.  
  
But the tragic thing is I can see moments of her getting better, she’s really musical but when shes depressed she can’t sing but she’s been starting to sing again, she’s really bad taking care of herself and she’s depressed but in the last few weeks and started to use nail varnish again it  doesn’t sound like a lot but it’s a massive step for her. But we had long periods of her getting with me for anything that I do I’ve asked if she wants to break up but she’s been adamant that she doesn’t, she even says we fit really well together and keeps saying shes feels better when shes with me which makes me feel so happy I am helping. But the simple fact of the matter is for months now I’ve been living in a really uncomfortable environment I try and build bridges just gets shot down. In the meantime I keep crossing lines I’m not comfortable with (whether that’s starting to help pay off some of her debts, or effectively having her move in without having agreed), but I feel if I try and push back she just gets more angry with me more unwell.  
  
I know if I ended the relationship it would pretty much destroy her (and she has more or less said that) I’m the only support network she’s got, and without me in her current situation I know she’d even struggle to do things like get regular food. And the honest truth is when we had in a good place I feel more alive with her than have anyone else. I also remember when I was badly depressed, I lost a lot of good friends including a good relationship because I wasn’t in any state to engage with people so it will be there to be supportive of her even if it means a few bumpy months, to look after someone I care about. But the stress of both carrying all of the burden for months, and constantly being berated for anything I do in my own home is starting to make me really ill to the point where it’s affecting my work in beginning to make me depressed in turn (something I haven’t had to deal with in years). When I have told her a few times I’m feeling really sad (without saying the cause is) she’s effectively just responded with well there’s not much I can do about that, and wandered off to watch TV or do things on her phone, while when the roles are reversed I drop everything to try and help her get through a dark period.  
  
I think if I keep this up I’m going to have a nervious breakdown, but at the same time besides the fact they do really care about her and would like to stay with them if I could, it feels monstrous to break up knowing I’d be destroying her support network and throwing her back into the dark kit she was in when we met.  
  
I’ve tried suggesting things like therapy and even offered to help her get access to it but while she initially shows interest she then doesn’t engage/ go forward with it. In general whenever I try and talk to her about my worries she just gets really angry with me to the point where I am scared to talk about my own needs. Ive also floated talking to other folk about out issues (id usually chat to friends or family about this sort of thing) but she got really angry and said it was private and I should not tell anyone hence coming hear where its at least anonymous)  
  
So I’m at a loss, as to what I can do next I can’t live the rest of my life like this, but I feel trapped and I’m getting to the point where I feel scared and depressed in my own house, but i dont want to abandon her in her current situation so I don’t want to do next.  
  
So for the kind souls who have read all the way through this  
  
I can give more detail on any of the above but felt I should stop as I have already written a bit of a novel in length.  
  
What do you think I should do?"
