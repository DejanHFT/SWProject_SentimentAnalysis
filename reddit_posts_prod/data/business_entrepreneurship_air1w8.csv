Entrepreneurship 101,Murrdog9000,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/air1w8/entrepreneurship_101/,0,2,"Every now and then, my girlfriend of 5 years gets it in her head that she wants to open her own business. I try to be supportive but realistic. We both have solid jobs right now so the idea of her taking a leap of faith does scare me. 

Her current idea is to do a small shack that serves  mainly breakfast sandwiches and coffee through a drive through window. She would either work by herself of have one other employee. 

I believe that it could be successful but neither she or I have the slightest clue about where to begin and actually make this a reality. 

Thanks in advance for any advice. "
