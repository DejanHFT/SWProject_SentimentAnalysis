"What is the song/melody played in the song Aicha (Live A Bercy 1,2,3 Soleils)",vjaiwantx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/166wacp/what_is_the_songmelody_played_in_the_song_aicha/,0,1,"Hello, I am dying to find the origin of the melody in this song Aicha (Live A Bercy 1,2,3 Soleils) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsrKrkVBfAo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsrKrkVBfAo) 

It appears at about 4:39 into the song and it is not there in the original version of the song by Khaled but it is played only in the live perfomance in the song for 1,2,3 Soleils (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,2,3\_Soleils), some say it is from a movie. But i was not able to find the specific kind of melody anywhere. Any idea where is this melody from and where do i find it?"
