Working for Creative Circle,dreamkino,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/138y324/working_for_creative_circle/,2,2,"I have been working for a client that was recruited for me by creative circle for over a year. During this time, I believed that the agency was taking a commission of 35-50% out of my pay rate. In my understanding, this meant that if I was being paid $40, the agency was charging the client not more than $60. 
However, I recently came to the realization that the agency might actually be taking their commission out of the pay rate they negotiated with the client, which would mean that they are receiving $80 and paying me only $40. 
I am now wondering if this is true, is it deducted from the rate they negotiated with you or with the client?"
