"Put yourself in a young child's mind. What kind of fun, creative, and imaginative world would you like to live in, if you could?",Ok_Sherbert_6062,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/17xx8im/put_yourself_in_a_young_childs_mind_what_kind_of/,12,11,"I am using this as inspiration for my 16 month old son's playroom mural. I have done 2 walls but am lost on the other 2. I am looking for imagery that invokes creativity, fun, and imagination.

For example, as a young child, I would've LOVED to live in a world with giant lollipops, ice cream sundaes, and magical dragons (yes, dragon tales lol.)

What kind of fun and creative world would you choose to live in as a young child?"
