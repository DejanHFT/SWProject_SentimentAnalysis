Does anyone have joined a tour by Cuban Adventures? Or can recommend a travel company for Cuba?,SteO153,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/14muff6/does_anyone_have_joined_a_tour_by_cuban/,7,3,"I'm planning to go to Cuba for 3 weeks next year, and Cuban Adventures has a [tour](https://www.cubagrouptour.com/tour/complete-cuba-tour-package) that I'm interested in, but it is a company that I don't know. Does anyone have joined a tour by Cuban Adventures? Or can recommend a travel company for Cuba? I looked at Intrepid and G Adventure, but their offer of 2w long tours doesn't go to Vi√±ales, and it is a place I really want to visit, so I would have to extend the trip to there with Cuban Adventures. TIA!

/TourRadar doesn't even have Cuba as destination..."
