My motivation at the gym today,Pulvercity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1opkcd/my_motivation_at_the_gym_today/,105,1073,"Today is leg day for me, and it took a lot for me to drag myself out of the apartment and get to work! But I'm really glad I did, because I witnessed something pretty exceptional.

About half way through my workout, a father and son came in and started working out. I then noticed that his son had down syndrome. But it didn't deter him from killing his workout! You could really tell he invested all effort into his reps. He struggled throughout his last few reps and still pushed out more. And what really lit up my heart was how much he was encouraging his father to continue and push out some more reps. He kept saying ""come on, you can do it"" in Swedish. It really made my day!

No excuses for this champ!"
