Most underrated countries to explore by rail?,13abarry,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/u849j8/most_underrated_countries_to_explore_by_rail/,15,3,I like to travel by train when solo traveling but many countries with good rail systems are very expensive (e.g. France and Japan). I've heard good things about Turkey when it comes to rail. What are some other affordable industrialized countries with safe tap water that have strong rail networks?
