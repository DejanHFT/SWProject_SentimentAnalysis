Starting a community for creatives to collaborate.,AnotherMoonDoge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/102owzk/starting_a_community_for_creatives_to_collaborate/,1,5,"I hope this is ok to post here, and isn't considered social media pushing or self promoting, as the intention is to be a resource for the community to help each other, but of course if this does not belong in this sub, please let me know, and I apologize in advance if so.

I am starting a community for all different types of creators and creatives to get together and collaborate, from programmers to artists to music producers and writers.


The goal of the community will be to have a place with a variety of skill sets and be able to get together to share ideas, receive feedback, and look for work/teams for projects.


As of now, the server is pretty barebones, and I am looking for people to help grow it with me, and give feedback on what is needed. As we get more members I hope to build an environment where people have a network they can lean on going forward in their creative careers/hobbies.


I am looking for members who are willing to help grow the community and provide feedback on what needs we can fill. Even if you are not interested in joining the community I would love to hear what resources you wish you had in an online community either now or possibly in the past.


With all that said, if you are interested in joining, the discord link is here: https://discord.gg/HNd2ZfxfEH"
