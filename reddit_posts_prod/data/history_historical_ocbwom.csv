Actual living history? Can you place yourself in an actual historical event?,alsatian01,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/ocbwom/actual_living_history_can_you_place_yourself_in/,489,1245,"I did a search on the sub using the term ""living history"" and found it refers to reenactment/ers. I don't mean that or, ' I remember when...."" I mean that you, yourself were in a historical event. Maybe a witness? Met an important historical figure. Had a historical event touch you personally? Maybe not my grandfather served in WWII, but maybe something along the lines ""he did not survive and it....""

The one that comes to mind for me was when ""don't ask, don't tell"" became a policy in the military. I happened to join the Army the day after, or the day Clinton surprised the military with that order. My recruiter had to actually cross the ""Are you a Homosexual"" question off my enlistment papers. There was a great deal of conversation about it as I went through the induction process. The active duty Army personnel were not allowed to talk about it at all with us, I'm sure they did amongst themselves. As I went through the medical screening process we were warned not to mention the subject to the civilian Doctor. He was very much against it, and would go off it were brought up. People who joined around that time, and were maybe a little effeminate got some sideways looks. That's my story, what is yours?

I'm new here and just want remind everyone to try to stay at the 20 year mark that is a rule for the sub. New here don't want to step on any toes, but I think some leniency may be allowed, but I don't make the rules. I am just trying to follow them. I think the mods took a gamble on letting this goto the group.

Some replies appear to be getting killed by the auto-mod. Try and give some context.

PS/Update 

Thanks to all who have submitted! Sorry to those who have been cut out by the Auto-mod. And sorry to the human mods that maybe working overtime with requests to restore posts. There might be a little inside joke between me and one of the mods I contacted about a different post idea I had. (This is just for that mod) how'd I do with my 2nd post? I'm going to have a long night of reading, replying, and up voting. Again thanks to all for participating. You've really given a nice boost to a new member on his 2nd attempt at tossing a friendly grenade in the group. I try and up vote every reply and comment, forgive me if I miss anyone."
