What to change if you don't feel inspired regarding a character?,GalacticKiss,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/13gt7bn/what_to_change_if_you_dont_feel_inspired/,19,27,"When writing, it feels good to connect to your characters and I think it helps facilitate the writing process. For me personally, my interest in the characters feels like the dominant motivating factor. I want to see how they'll experience something.

But what do you do when you don't find yourself connecting with an important character? If you write them out, wouldn't that make all your characters perhaps too same-ish? Is it just about getting to know their backstory more until you are inspired and connected?

What's your solution? This could also likely apply to inspiration regarding a location. What do you do to drive yourself when there's some piece of your story that you can see as interesting and compelling in general, but for some reason you find yourself really trudging or dreading working on said location/person?"
