Lost. School or no school ? Can I get a job adjacent to the creative field ? How? Open to feedback and advice.,ifiniasms,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/rrf5uh/lost_school_or_no_school_can_i_get_a_job_adjacent/,33,44,"Hi Creatives,
I would like your career advice. 

Currently, If I keep going on without becoming a professional creative I think I may regret my life. Maybe this is a overstatement... 

 I'm working a front desk job and it's part time. 
In my past i studied psychology 
After college
 I've dabbled in design for games and learned UX processes (none of it in a professional setting) 
Otherwise I worked normal jobs. Like teaching kids. 

I'm wondering if I should go to school or get help somehow .

Yet I know I need to work and have income. Not get too weighed down with ""school"" or more school. 

What can I do? Especially when I have no portfolio or skillset. And I know the fastest way would be to get work experience somehow .
Can I just get a job adjacent to the creative field ? While I build my portfolio? 

I purchased some graphic design courses. Yet I'm constantly distracted with different ideas.
I still want to work on games. I thought of community management.
I think my greatest interest is storytelling.
 I want to try photography and film. 

Would love your advice, Reddit.

*thank you everyone for your input! am so happy for the support.
I am going to just put one foot in front of the other... if I go to school. then ok."
