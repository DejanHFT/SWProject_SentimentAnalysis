"Hey r/fitness, I'm joining a gym today. What 
questions should I ask the 'Wellness Advisor' aka 
sales guy when I join?",Deep_Thought,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/96ds5/hey_rfitness_im_joining_a_gym_today_what/,20,4,"* I have been to the gym. It has good facilities, equipment, dumbbells up to 150 lbs...yadda yadda. What are the main things that I need to clarify with the sales guy apart from the sign up fee info?

* It's an XSport gym in North-West IL. Have anyone of you been to them? If so, please share your experiences.

* Any tips on getting cheaper prices on membership? Prices are at US$75 enrollment + US$39/mo excluding spa.

**EDIT:** 

Thanks for the responses guys! The guy told me that I could sign up for a yearly membership with 6mos extra for 530. So that comes about to 29 a mo for 18 months. I will ask about the early termination fees and assessment fees, as well as policies. What other fitness chains can you think of that offer cheaper memberships? What features do they have? I am looking for a gym, pool and steam room. All other benefits are secondary.

I've been to a YMCA in my area that has a gym and pool. They charge 28 a month on a monthly basis, but they don't have a steam room :|"
