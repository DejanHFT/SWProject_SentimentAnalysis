Some inspiration for those of you fretting that you haven't written your masterpiece yet or haven't become a successful writer,Motorvision,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/7xclzc/some_inspiration_for_those_of_you_fretting_that/,155,585,"I'll be 30 at the end of this year, and while I continue to write and hope to get published in the near future, I've also constantly reminded myself that time is on my side. That's not an excuse for me to slack off, but just a mental note that I'm still young and have plenty of room to grow and improve

What helps is realizing that plenty of my favorites were into their 30s, or older, when they scored a book deal and/or their first big hit. Consider this:

* Stephen King was in his late 20s when his career started going 
* JK Rowling was broke and in her early 30s when she got a deal for Harry Potter
* Yann Martel was 38 when Life of Pi came out to great acclaim
* Ian McEwan was in his 30s when he first got published, but was nearly 40 when his first book of note, Child in Time, got published, and was in his early 50s when his best known work, Atonement, came out
* George R.R. Martin had already been published numerous times, but was 48 when the A Song of Fire and Ice series started
* Cormac McCarthy got his first book published at 32, and while his first few books are solid, it wasn't until he was 52 that he put out his first masterpiece, Blood Meridian, and he was into his 70s when No Country for Old Men and The Road came out

Let's look beyond writers and at filmmakers:

* Martin Scorsese already had a few films under his belt, but it wasn't until Taxi Driver that he really started making a name for himself, when he was 34
* While Denis Villeneuve had already been making films for a while, it wasn't until 2013's Prisoners that he started getting mainstream attention, when he was 46
* Chris Nolan first got attention with Memento, when he was 30, entered the mainstream with Batman Begins at 35, but you could argue that his greatest work has been in his 40s (Inception, Intersellar, Dunkirk)
* Steven Spielberg was 29 and 30 when he released Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, respectively. His best work, in my opinion, didn't come until much later (mid 30s for ET and the first Indiana Jones, mid 40s for Jurassic Park and Schindler's List, early 50s for Saving Private Ryan)

I'm sure you could find many, many more examples, but the point is, if you're young (high school, college, mid-to-late 20s), you shouldn't feel any sort of rush. Take the time to master your craft and grow. And for those of you that are older, as some of my examples show, sometimes the older you are, the better your work, and just because you're in your 30s, 40s, 50s, doesn't mean you missed your chance

Happy writing everyone"
