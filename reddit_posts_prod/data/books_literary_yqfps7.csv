Do you consider books covers to be an example of literary adaptation?,detectivecatwizard,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/yqfps7/do_you_consider_books_covers_to_be_an_example_of/,44,22,"Hi all!

I am currently on my final year of university and writing my dissertation on intertextuality, and book covers and their role they play in literary adaptation. 

So, can book covers be termed as adaptations even though they technically belong to the original source material they are ""adapting"". 

I feel as if it may be a bit of a fatuous question but I am interested in everyone's answers all the same. Apologies if I have worded this poorly.

P.S. this is my first reddit post, any and every response is welcome!"
