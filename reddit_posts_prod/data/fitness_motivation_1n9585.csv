Hey all! Come join us again at /r/BTFC for our competition. For the newbies, you sign up with some photos of yourself in the next couple of weeks... and then in 12 weeks you post the same poses again. Us mods judge them and then hand out a bunch of prizes. It's all in good fun and we encourage people to create throwaway accounts in case you're not comfortable posting with your main (prizes may be transferred to another account at the end if you win).

**RULES**

Read all of them! There's a lot there, but it makes our (the mods that approve your post) jobs a hundred times easier when you do.
