Is medicine/technology killing evolution?,BigWesternMan,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fsq75/is_medicinetechnology_killing_evolution/,16,0,"What I mean is; before the advent of modern medicine, prosthetics, and other such advances, if a child was born with any sort of defect, or deformity, or susceptibility to a disease, chances are it would die, before being able to reproduce. Fast forward to today however, and we can manage a lot of chronic illnesses, we vaccinate, we have wheelchairs, and we can remove nasty things from the body through extensive surgery.

Are we shooting ourselves in the foot somewhat by doing this? Have we reached a point where the human race will no longer evolve naturally? At all?"
