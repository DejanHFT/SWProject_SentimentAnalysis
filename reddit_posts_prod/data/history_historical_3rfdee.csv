"After reading ""I, Claudius"" and ""Claudius the God"", I'm in the mood for more excellent historical fiction taking place in the Roman Empire. Any suggestions?",Tularemia,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3rfdee/after_reading_i_claudius_and_claudius_the_god_im/,396,998,"The so-called ""year of four emperors"" seems like it would probably an interesting period to read about (and overall picks up fairly closely to where the *Claudius the God* ends which would be ideal), but I'm open to suggestions from anything from the imperial Roman era. Do you have any novels in mind?

I should also note that I'm not ONLY interested in fiction. Non-fiction also works if it is well-written."
