Why do literary critics hate genre fiction so much?,SkepticDrinker,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/sr9wd4/why_do_literary_critics_hate_genre_fiction_so_much/,509,877,"I was reading an article by a critic in the literary world who decided, after the age of 60, to give stephen king a shot because he didn't want to think of himself as a snob. He read 11/22/63 and Pet's Cemetery and said ""Yeah, nothing here of value."" Like what? I can get you don't like a genre or an author but these types of people just seem to hold anything that isn't Faulkner or Hemingway with contempt. Aren't books supposed to entertain and from that we start to ask why we like it?"
