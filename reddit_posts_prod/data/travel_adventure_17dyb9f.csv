Trip/adventure across America?,Every_Fox3461,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17dyb9f/tripadventure_across_america/,26,8,"So I landed a good job here in Canada, after a year all my debt will be paid, and I'll have approximately 30k in the bank. I want to travel America, see the sights live out of my car and play guitar, I'll have about 5-8 months to myself. Then I'll get back to it again. 
How would you tackle this? I want to go on an adventure, meet locals, musicians, hike the best parks, work. I'm tired of being in Canada and only Canada. 
I'm early 30s, can handle rough crowds and have no kids and no wife/gf. I'm free. I want to make some memories.
My biggest hit list is Yosemite national park, Denver Colarado, Texas, Tennessee, 

Thanks for reading my speal here. I'm both excited and a little lost on where to start. Guess I'm trying to do a road trip with intermixing stops."
