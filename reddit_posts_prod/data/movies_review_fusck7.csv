"In 1994, Roger Egbert reviewed the comedy “Milk Money”, a film about a prostitute who befriends 3 boys. He hated it so much, that he didn’t give it a conventional negative review. Instead, he phrased his review as a fictional conversation between two studio executives discussing the movie.",Tokyono,https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/milk-money-1994,1739,37926,No text content
