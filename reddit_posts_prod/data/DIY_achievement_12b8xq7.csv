trying to figure out potential lifting mechanisms for DIY adjustable height bed,whodisssssssss,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/12b8xq7/trying_to_figure_out_potential_lifting_mechanisms/,12,5,"I have been working on pre design of a adjustable height bed frame project, and have run through a small list of lifting mechanisms that I could potentially use to fabricate this project. unfortunately I am running into road blocks in achieving the desired lifting potentials and cant seem to think of a mechanism that can suit my idea.

The major issues I am encountering is in minimum and maximum heights stability and storability. ideally I had wanted to be able to lower the bed to a height of about one foot and raise from that height up to close to three feet. ideally the lifting process would be achieved with an electric motor or other non manual method depending on the mechanism.

what I have found is that all of the mechanisms that appear to be capable of such lifts tend to be lever jack based and have obtrusive posts or that they have significantly higher minimum lowered heights or alternatively would rely on a pulley system from above which is not an option for me. some other mechanisms that originally appeared to be plausible use cases include air jacks and scissor jacks. I have almost immediately excluded the airbag jacks as they cant reach the desired height and seem as though they would pose a safety hazard as well as stability concern if I were to try stacking them. 

cheap electric scissor jacks appear to be a potential fit if I were to bolt them to a 1/2 inch plywood base and then stack a secondary plywood base and jack set however even with both bases being bolted to each other I fear that this would be unstable as I know these devices are technically not meant to bear weight even though they are ""rated"" up to a few tons in most cases, and have seen plenty of lifted objects sheer to a side and fall.

so the heart of my question is, are there other mechanism types that I could potentially use for this project if I am trying to contain the lifting mechanism to under the bed while still being able to potentially utilize that space?"
