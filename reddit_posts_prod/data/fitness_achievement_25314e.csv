I guess this is sort of an achievement... :D,ShowersUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/25314e/i_guess_this_is_sort_of_an_achievement_d/,9,0,"It feels good to see improvement but while doing bicep curls and forearms today, I saw a vein. HOLY FRIGIN' SHIT I SAW A VEIN. Probably not much to most of you but a huge achievement for me. I just wanted to share that :) Shit's getting serious now lol

**EDIT: [Forgot to add] Male, 205lbs (last checked about a last week), 5""11, 17. I alternate each day with legs and arms. This week started with legs monday and arms tuesday, then legs again wednesday and today arms. Also, second achievement today, I lifted 100lbs with everything except for biceps and triceps. B&T's I lifted around 45 to 50. Reps of 10-20 with 10 second breaks. I've been lifting a little bit more every other day. I feel good. I've finally got my small gut to go away as well. :)**"
