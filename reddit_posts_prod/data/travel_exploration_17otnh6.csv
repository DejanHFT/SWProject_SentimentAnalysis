What is the shortest layover you'd feel comfortable taking a cab into the city and exploring?,Fickle_Broccoli,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17otnh6/what_is_the_shortest_layover_youd_feel/,60,68,"I just booked a flight where I have a little over a 5 hour layover in Detroit. Thinking of finding the best Detroit style pizza joint I can, and taking a cab to eat and drink a couple beers before hopping back on my flight. 

I've never done this before. How much ""city time"" is worth it to you? Obviously taxi commute time is a factor. I'm thinking that if I can spend at least two hours in a new (to me) city, and still be back in the airport with over an hour before my flight, it's worth the exploration."
