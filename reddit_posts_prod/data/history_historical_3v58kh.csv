Removal of historical art to prevent offence: Minnesota State Capitol,Gunnar123abc,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3v58kh/removal_of_historical_art_to_prevent_offence/,73,212,"The Minnesota State Capitol Restoration Project is considering removing some apparently offence pieces of art. I am wondering what those on this subreddit think of it? Do you support it? Against it? 

**Link to website:**

If they were removed, they would be the first original pieces of art removed from the capitol building since it was inaugurated.  (These pieces minus the last, were all original to the inauguration of the building)

Here are the pieces that are being complained about:

**Painting | ""Father Hennepin discovering the Falls of St. Anthony"" (1905), by Stephen A. Douglas Volk**

Picture:
http://mn.gov/admin/images/father-hennepin-at-falls-of-st%252Eanthony.jpg

[Archbishop John Ireland](http://bit.ly/1Tv2elp) suggested this event to be featured in the capitol.

   ""Father Hennepin with a guide had been taken prisoner by the Sioux Indians near Mille Lacs, but he was so agreeable and helpful that the chiefs allowed him to rejoin LaSalle, and it was on his way down that he discovered the falls, where now flourishes the city of Minneapolis.
   The missionary priest stands in profile, upholding a crude cross and blessing the falls; the guide, Picard Dugay, kneels in reverence, while the Indians appear interested, but not impressed in a religious sense. To the right of the canvas a squaw approaches with a pack upon her back, which signifies that a portage is to be made around the falls. The heads of the Indian chiefs are shaven; until the advent of Father Hennepin, who taught them to use the razor, they accomplished this by the heroic application of hot stones.
   The grouping of the picture is artistic, and the color fresh with a good open-air effect.""

**Painting | ""The Treaty of Traverse des Sioux"" (1905), by David Francis Millet (hanging in State Capitol)** 

Picture:
http://mn.gov/admin/images/treaty-of-traverse-des-sioux-Millet.png

[General James Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Baker) of the State Capitol Board of Commissioners argued to include this painting. The “treaty was as formal as a meeting of the Roman Senate,
and was marked by all the negotiations of a solemn contract between independent nations,”

   ""Upon a platform in the center of the canvas stand two white men, one of whom shakes hands with an Indian chief; to the left is a group of white men, and upon the other side are sixty or more Indians sitting or standing. The signing of the treaty took place in 1851, and by it the Indians ceded to the government some twenty-four million acres of land in Minnesota, Iowa, and South Dakota; in return they were to receive three and a half millions of dollars, and be taught the arts of civilization.
   Governor Ramsey stands upon the platform with several medals in his hand, one of which was given to each chief as he signed the treaty and shook hands with the federal agent, United States Commissioner Luke Lea. General Sibley and other well-known early residents of the state are back of the platform, and to the left is a table at which a chief is sitting, about to sign a treaty.
   The entire group is under canopy of dried leaves and boughs, which is historically correct. The boughs were green when put up three weeks before the signing of the treaty. M Millet, to be accurate and realistic, built a similar one at his home in Worchestershire, England, and waited three weeks before painting it.
   The picture is strong in drawing, and thoroughly pleasing in color. The bright colors of the blankets and headgear of the Indians are in contrast to the sober colors of the white men. Most of the figures are depicted as being in the shade of the canopy, while the sun shines upon those seated towards the front, and upon the Indian teepees in the distance. The artist has centralized the attention upon the standing group making them the cynosure of all figures in the picture.""

**Mural | ""Discoverers and Civilizers Led to the Source of the Mississippi"" (1905), by Edwin H. Blashfield**

Picture:
http://mn.gov/admin/images/discoverers-and-civilizers-led-to-the-source-of-the-mississippi.jpg

Objections state that the piece symbolizes manifest destiny, and that the priest and dogs might be considered allegory for forced conversion (according to petition to remove it). 

   ""In his two lunettes--which are said by the critics in the East to be his best work--Mr. Blashfield had admirably attuned his colors to their surroundings. The general tone of the color in ""The Discoverers and Civilizers Led to the Source of the Mississippi"" is a cool white and green in the center, changing into soft warm greys and reds towards the sides.
   In the center of the picture, seated upon a slight elevation, and in august dignity, is the Great Manitou, the chief god of the Indians. In his hand he holds an urn from which pours the Father of Waters, the Mississippi river. At the right are a number of men- The first explorers and pioneers over which soars the Spirit of Discovery holding the mariner's compass in one and and pointing towards the Source of the Mississippi with the other. This group is menaced by a superb Indian in war bonnet, who stands near an Indian girl who crouches at the foot of the Great Manitou, and to whom a priest is offering salvation in the form of a crucifix, across the rushing waters. Back of the priest are men, women and children; the dogs held in a leash and the boat upon the opposite side show the principal means of travel in the early days. The colonists are guided by the Spirit of Civilization, who floats gracefully above them. The background consists of pine tress, rocks and sky."" (The Minnesota Capitol: Official Guide and History)

**Painting | ""Eighth Minnesota at the Battle of Ta-Ha-Kouty (Killdeer Mountain)"" (1910), by Carl L. Boeckmann, Room 317**

Picture:
http://mn.gov/admin/images/eighth-minnesota-at-the-battle-of-ta-ha-kouty-killdeer-mountain.jpg

   This piece was added to the capitol at the time because the Eighth Minnesota Regiment had no representation in the State Capitol, so they put this in. (The Minnesota State Capitol is really almost a civil war museum in the amount of civil war related art/memorials are in there). This piece must be interpreted with knowledge of the [Dakota War of 1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_War_of_1862)
