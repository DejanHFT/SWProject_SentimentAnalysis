"Apparently less than 10% of Americans reach the Adequate Daily Intake of Choline, and many don't even come close. Why aren't the negative side-effects of choline deficiency (i.e fatty liver disease) more common?",SergeantApone,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/58amu8/apparently_less_than_10_of_americans_reach_the/,3,4,"To elaborate, apparently to reach this goal you need to eat either 4 large eggs every single day,  more than 100 grams of raw beef liver, or something like 1 kilo of broccoli/cauliflower. Every *single* day. 

I'm not the healthiest eater and should probably eat more veg, but I can't imagine that even very healthy individuals come anywhere close to reaching that goal every day. In fact based on what people around me eat, it seems like they'd all be pretty deep in choline deficiency.

Here's a quote from wikipedia:

> The choline researcher Dr. Steven Zeisel wrote: ""A recent analysis of data from NHANES 2003â€“2004 revealed that for [American] older children, men, women and pregnant women, mean choline intakes are far below the AI. Ten percent or fewer had usual choline intakes at or above the AI.""[3]

The symptoms of deficiency include fatty liver disease and ""haemorrhagic kidney necrosis."" Not to mention the technical medical term of ""**Adequate** Intake"" strongly suggests that this should be the minimum amount.

So why aren't fatty liver disease and haemorrhagic necrosis more common? And why aren't we seeing all the other negative health problems that you'd expecting given that 90% of the population is apparently not getting an adequate intake of an essential vitamin?"
