Why is there an explicit line between Phase 3 and roll out of a vaccine?,CodedElectrons,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/k955d8/why_is_there_an_explicit_line_between_phase_3_and/,228,3256,"With the technology of today (ease of internet access, video medicine, and smart watches, etc), Why is there an explicit ""end of Phase 3 Trials""? Shouldn't it just be ""begin Phase 3a"" at whatever rate the vaccine can be produced, and include placebos, continue to add new phase 3a patients at the dose production rate. When the number of cases in the placebo group have become sufficient to determine efficacy and the efficacy is good move to phase 3b, just continue administering doses of the real vaccine and no more placebo, could we have been at about 10 million people vaccinated by now? When your confidence reaches a certain level, discontinue asymptomatic monitoring that requires one-to-one medical staff, and discontinue smart watch requirements, but encourage patients to continue log data if they wish.  Also reduce the patient acceptance requirements.  For this particular incident, the explicit dividing line between Phase 3 and rollout is costing 1000-2000 lives a day."
