I hate the elitist tone of much food media,BoxedWineBonnie,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/hks9yq/i_hate_the_elitist_tone_of_much_food_media/,650,2725,"Forgive me for being grouchy, but as a person on a budget who also likes to cook and eat nice things, I detest when I'm reading a recipe or watch a cooking show that starts off by showing you the delicious dish you hope to make, and then devolves into this:

""I get the very best \[INGREDIENT\] here in the foothills of the \[REMOTE LOCATION\] where local \[FARMERS/VINTERS/MONKS\] have been \[GROWING/RAISING/CRAFTING\] the finest \[FOOD\] since time immemorial. If you can't get \[FOOD\] from here or at your local \[OBSCENELY EXPENSIVE IMPORTER\], you can always substitute \[FOOD YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIND AND AFFORD\] but it won't be even half as good."" (Cue the person toasting the local food producer and tucking into their meal with near orgasmic delight.)

Like, I am sure that food is delicious, but is it the difference between a food being 5/10 versus 10/10? Or would the recipe otherwise be like, 8/10?"
