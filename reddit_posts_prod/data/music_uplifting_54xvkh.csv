Helping hand - Motivational/Uplifting Music,Zyah7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/54xvkh/helping_hand_motivationaluplifting_music/,0,0,"
Hello! So I have a request, which I am not sure if this is the correct place to post this or not... I can delete/move this if necessary.

So, I'm creating a playlist for my fiance, who recently turned 30. He is an artist and is currently in a bit if a slump (depression). I'd love to find maybe partially inspirational music, but I am a simple pleb when it comes to music, so would appreciate some suggestions. I myself listen to Foster the People or Presidents of the US of A, and usually am instantly smilling.

I'll provide some genres/bands he likes, but feel free to post whatever song, artist that makes you feel that giddy feeling inside.

Some of the genres he loves are blues, stoner rock, folk/heavy/black metal, prog, pretty much any 90's rock, old school hip hop.

Some of the bands he loves, no particular order: Clutch, The Heavy, The Sword, Metallica, Dio, Tenacious D, Lonely Island, Blues Brothers, Manowar, Amon Amarth, Fintroll, Turisas, Opeth, Cake, Presidents of the US, Between the Burried and Me, Baroness, Barenaked Ladies, Korpiklanni, Limp Bizkit, Lit, Beasty Boys, Flobots, Aretha Franklin, The Black Keys, Fratellis, Elvis, Wolfmother, Whitestripes, Ramones, Alestorm, Dream Evil, Rage Against the Machine, Tool, Pennywise, Korn, Pink Guy? (He loves Filthy Frank's music for some reaso lol), and a shit ton more. 

Tl;DR

Share music that makes you feel that giddy feeling inside, music you listen to motivate or uplift yourself. I listen to Foster the People or Presidents of the US of A. "
