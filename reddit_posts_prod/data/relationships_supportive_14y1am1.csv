Trying to be supportive of partner’s kinky side,Borntodarkness713,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14y1am1/trying_to_be_supportive_of_partners_kinky_side/,27,1,"
My (36F) partner (32M) have been together about a year and a half. Recently, he revealed he’s into cross dressing and is active in the sissydom. I’ve supported this by becoming his key holder, engaging in pegging and even buying some feminine wear. None of this bothers me and I want to do whatever it takes so that he feels valued. He’s said he loves me and even wants to get married but the more research I do, the more nagging trust and confidence issues rear their heads (I’ve been cheated on multiple times). Sissies want to engage in play with men and I know that he has talked to models/bots about giving them oral. To me, this is emotional cheating and I am hurt and scared he will cheat on me. We’ve had some honest and raw discussions but the messages to these people, real or fake scare me. 

I’m not sure how to approach this? Is anyone else in this kind of dynamic and can offer suggestions?

TL;DR: boyfriend has a kink that is making my confidence and trust issues spiral. How do I communicate more effectively without being accusatory?"
