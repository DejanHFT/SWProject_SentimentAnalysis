I didn't plan to support us both,NoSoyUnPapaAzucar,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/175j281/i_didnt_plan_to_support_us_both/,8,1,"Ok guys. I am gonna try to make this as short and to-the-point as possible. I (30M) recently lost my dad (66M). When dad was still in the hospital, I told my long-distance girlfriend, Venus (24F) that I thought I needed some space to navigate this loss. My mom (62F) was having a VERY difficult time and my brother and I were the closest and most consistent support. I wanted to be able to focus on that. After about a month, my girlfriend informed me that she would be moving to my city. For context, we had NEVER discussed this before. I asked why. She gave a few seemingly reasonable reasons, implying that my presence here was more of a ""bonus"" than a primary reason. Logically, I think I knew that was not true. But, I was so emotionally exhausted, I didn't fight that. 

Anyway, my mother depended heavily on dad for financial support, as well as things like car maintenance, etc. Since I am the only person in my immediate family with disposable income, I have been supporting both mom's house and mine. So, things look a little different for me financially. This is one of the concerns that I expressed to Venus when they discussed moving here. Because I knew that they were not in a financially stable position, I was concerned that I would end up becoming financially responsible for her. She reassured me that was not the case. Once I started feeling like myself again, I started spending time with Venus. For the past 8 months, I have been basically supporting us both. She has a place. However, she spends 90% of time at my place. When she is with me, she does not spend any money at all. Under normal circumstances, I probably would not care enough to say anything. But, seeing that I have already more than doubled my bills every month and now, basically have a dependent, things feel stressful. 

The thing that kind of pushed me over the edge seems small. I guess when considering all of it, though, I get kind of angry. I have noticed that every time she leaves my place - even if just for a day or two - she packs a bag with food. On one hand, I feel extremely saddened by this. On the other hand, I feel very frustrated. She knows that I want to be the provider for my family. But, we haven't even been together for a year yet. That is something I want for my wife. Please tell me...how would you navigate all this?

TL;DR My girlfriend is struggling financially and somehow, I am now essentially supporting us both."
