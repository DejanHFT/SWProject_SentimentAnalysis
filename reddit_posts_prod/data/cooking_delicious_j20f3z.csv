In the Middle East it's extremely popular, and you can get it at restaurants and even takeaways all over the region. The history of the lentil in the region goes back quite literally to the dawn of civilization and I like to think we have mastered the making of lentil soups. To this day it's eaten regularly in households all over the region and I think you should cook it this winter. If you grew up disliking lentils like myself, you may find yourself converted by this recipe.

As usual I have a [full video recipe](https://youtu.be/oi-dcSkR-FQ) which you can follow and I've linked to all my past r/cooking posts in the comments.


## What is Middle Eastern Lentil soup
[Middle Eastern lentil soup](https://imgur.com/a/bykh8Qj) is made by boiling split red (or yellow) lentils until softened and tender. They're usually cooked with a combination of different vegetables or meat and are spiced accordingly to the taste of each country. The dish is widely eaten throughout the Middle East and is commonly served during the Month of Ramadan, when many people like to break their fast with a bowl of warm soup, it has the benefit of being simple to cook and very filling which make it a perfect Ramadan meal. Lentil soup is also a favorite amongst Middle Eastern Christian communities many of whom fast and adhere to a vegan diet for many days throughout the year including the Coptic Christians of Egypt who fast a whopping 180-210 days. 

The dish itself heavily varies from country to country and even house to house, and is usually made with whatever vegetables are on hand. I find that the use of onions, carrots and tomatoes give it a delicious and well rounded flavor, though it's possible to also add celery or courgettes (zuchinni). In this recipe the soup is blended once cooked into a smooth and creamy texture, with the lentils helping to emulsify the soup until it resembles the texture of a cream based soup. In some countries the soup is not blended, and it can have eggs, beans or even pieces of meat added to it. The moroccan dish [Harrira](https://mayihavethatrecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Vegetarian-harira-soup-2.jpg), takes the soup further, with the addition of chickpeas, meat, celery and spring onions as well as more spices that give it a beautiful brick red color and smokier flavor. Most Lentil soups have fried vermicelli added to them which gives a slight texture contrast just like in chicken noodle soup. In the levant it's also common to add fried bread croutons (like those used in a fattoush salad) to the soup to give it a nice layer of crunch. 

I'd recommend first making this recipe with the same ingredients and spices, then put your own twist on it. I think the addition of chipotle peppers and adobo would give it an amazing smokey flavor, or the addition of some fresh herbs and lemon would give it a nice sourness.  

## History
Lentils have been eaten in the Middle East for millenia and are thought to be one of the first foods cultivated by humans, indeed they're considered the oldest domesticated pulse crop. Architectural digs have found evidence of lentil consumption along the Euphrates river going back to 8000BC and they've been mentioned in the holy books of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Ancient Egyptians even left offerings of lentils in tombs to feed the mumified on their journey to the afterlife. The first mention of lentil stew as a dish exists in the book of Genesis 25:34 ""Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew; and he ate and drank, and rose and went on his way."". Given their historical significance and popularity, it's no surprise that they continued to be popular into the modern day. 

In ""Annals of the Caliphs' Kitchens"" a 10th century cookbook from Baghdad, a chapter called ""Making Dishes of Yellow Lentils"" describes a recipe that closely resembles this one, it says:
""Wash and pick over hulled lentil and cook it until it falls apart and becomes mushy. Cook with it round onion, olive oil, and salt. Add some vinegar. You have the option of adding to it sugar and saffron. Alternatively, if you do not like to use saffron or onion, put bruised garlic cloves and a dusting of cumin in the pot after adding the vinegar"". 

After the introduction of the Tomato to the Middle East, it has kind of become a necessary ingredient in lentil soup which really elevates the flavor of the dish. The introduction of blenders and food processors also eased the process of milling the cooked lentils into a smooth soup, which prior to that was mashed by hand.

## Flavor Profile

The dish is definitely a wintery tasting dish and despite not containing the usual winter spices, the earthiness of the lentils really make it feel so. The main flavor here comes from the lentils, which give the soup an earthy and nutty flavor. The red lentils in particular don't overpower the flavors of the other components and like a mushroom I find they empower the other flavors in the dish. The garlic is also quite noticeable and it gives a nice pleasant garlicky flavour to the soup. Using both crushed and fried garlic gives you a strong depth of flavor. You also get a little bit of heat from both the cumin and chili powder which takes on a background flavor in the soup, and are tolerable even to someone who doesn't like spice.

One of the main flavors here actually comes from the addition of vinegar which elevates the flavors of the whole dish, it adds just the right amount of tang and sourness to brighten the dish and rebalance the earthiness of the lentils and vegetables. The vegetables are blended into the lentils and although you can't distinctly taste each of them, they contribute sweetness and a fresh flavor to the soup, particularly the carrots add a bright flavor.  

## Ingredients

Makes 4-6 large servings

* 1.25L (1.25 qt) Vegetable stock, you can also use chicken, meat or even water. If you are using stock cubes rather than fresh stock, then please use high quality ones.
* 250g (1/2 lb) Split Red Lentils
* 150g (5 1/4 oz) Carrots (about 1 large or 2 medium)
* 1 Brown Onion
* 1 Tomato 
* 4-6 Garlic Cloves
* 1/2 Cup Short Wheat Vermicelli
* 3 Tbsp White Vinegar
* 1 1/2 Tbsp Olive Oil
* 1 1/2 Tsp Salt 
* 1 1/2 Tsp Ground Cumin
* 1/2 Tsp Ground Black Pepper
* 1/4 Tsp Chili powder (cayenne or whatever you have on hand)

## Directions 

1. Peel and slice your carrots into large chunks about 1 cm or 1/2 an inch thick
2. Peel your onion, remove the root and top and slice into quarters
3. Wash your tomato and slice into quarters, we'll remove the skin later
3. Peel your garlic cloves, mince 2 of them and set aside, the rest should be lightly crushed
4. Add your chopped vegetables, the lentils and garlic (the crushed ones not minced) to a large stock pot
5. Add your stock or water to the pot as well as 1 teaspoon of cumin, turn the heat up to high and bring the pot to a boil
6. When the pot boils, retrieve the tomato quarters and remove their skin, then add them back to the pot
7. Turn the heat down to low and allow the soup to simmer for 45 minutes. When done simmering, the carrots should be cooked through and the lentils should be swollen and mushy
8. Using an immersion (stick) blender, blend the soup and all the vegetables pieces into a uniformly smooth mixture. Once blended it will have a creamy texture that resembles wall paint, remove the soup from the heat and set aside (check the notes for regular blender warning)
9. In a small pot add 1/2 a tbsp of olive oil on medium high heat and add the 2 minced garlic cloves to it
10. Fry for about 30 seconds then add the remaining cumin
11. Fry for another 15 seconds then add the vinegar
12. Mix and fry for 15 more seconds and add pour the mixture into the lentil soup
13. Add salt, pepper and Chili powder (optional) then mix the soup well. Taste your soup and check for seasoning, you may need to add another 1/2 tsp of salt if your stock is low in sodium, or add more Chili powder if you'd like it spicier
14. In a pot add the remaining olive oil and the vermicelli and fry on medium high heat until it turns a golden color. Stir constantly as it can burn easily
15. Add the fried vermicelli to the soup as well as 1 cup of water to thin the soup out. Bring the pot to a boil once more and allow the vermicelli to cook for 10 minutes
16. When the time is up, your soup is ready. The vermicelli will have absorbed some water from the soup, so add more water to thin it out until it's thinner than the paint like texture from before. It should be able to coat the back of a spoon without running, similar to the consistency of cooking cream.
17. Garnish with coriander, thin slices of Chili and nigella seeds

## Notes and tips

* You must use split red lentils for this, brown or green ones have a lot stronger taste and I think the dish won't taste right with them
* You can serve this over rice and it will be a close approximation to Yellow Lentil Koshari or Kichidi
* If you have a spice grinder, then toast whole cumin seeds and use them instead for an even more powerful flavor
* A standard blender can be used in place of an immersion blender, however you need to be sure to either remove the steam vent from the lid, or leave the lid slightly ajar, as it can explode when you blend hot soups
* The method for making the fried bread croutons is in [my fattoush post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/hjx5o7/every_week_i_cook_a_middle_eastern_recipe_this/)"
