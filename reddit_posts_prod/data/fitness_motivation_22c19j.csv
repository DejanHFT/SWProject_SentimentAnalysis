Has anyone else noticed a reduction of gym motivation after 10 years? How did you deal with it?,oh84s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/22c19j/has_anyone_else_noticed_a_reduction_of_gym/,66,38,"I've been going to the gym since I was 18. When I first got into it aggressively I had insane motivation and tried to train 5 times a week, I managed this year in year out. But I've noticed that over the past year I've just lost motivation, till the last month I have actually started making excuses like ""i'm too tired"" ""Oh its 9pm i'll just watch instead of training"" and stuff like that. It actually scares me slightly, because ive never been one to make excuses about going to the gym and always felt those people were just lazy. I still have been lifting weights 2-3 times a week and cardio 2 times a week but I just lack enthusiasm about training lately and I can feel my strength slipping.

Has anyone else been through this? "
