Where Does Homage/Inspiration Trespass Into Plagiarism?,StevenTheEmbezzler,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/16e87tm/where_does_homageinspiration_trespass_into/,10,5,"My current WIP is a fantasy world reminiscent of JRPGs like Dragon Quest, as well as TTRPGs like Dungeons and Dragons. I've named the main character Erdrick, intended as an homage to Dragon Quest, but someone pointed out (highlighting my concerns) that this is no bueno as far as wanting to get my work published and distributed to a greater audience, which makes sense since I'd rather not have to deal with lawyers representing Square Enix.

Hence, the title of this post. 

Even though this character 1) does not exist in a one-for-one setting of any of the Dragon Quest games (or any D&D world like Faerun for example) and 2) bears no physical likeness to nor shares any character traits with the Dragon Quest character, is this licit in the writing world?"
