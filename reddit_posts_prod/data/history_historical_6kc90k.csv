"What're some great, historical movies that are extremely accurate?",Kayters,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6kc90k/whatre_some_great_historical_movies_that_are/,103,45,"Hi guys,

I'm looking for some historical movies that are extremely accurate. Should we start making a list?

I'll start by mentioning Barry Lyndon, since as far as I know it's a great representation of the XVIII century.

Any others to recommend? I was looking into A Man for All Seasons (Fred Zinnemann) which takes place in the XV century, but I don't know anything about that.

Thank you!"
