What is one of your most delicious pasta recipes?,Viola_lee_blues,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/10wqp1c/what_is_one_of_your_most_delicious_pasta_recipes/,9,2,"I want to make some delicious homemade pasta (noodles and all) for my partner for Valentine's. I'm not thinking ravioli, as we have a fair amount in the freezer from my last pasta craving. 
What are some of your favorite, elevated, not run of the mill dishes? Thanks in advance!"
