Beginner - how to ballance inspiration with discipline ?,Iplooky_Razvan,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/16se8yf/beginner_how_to_ballance_inspiration_with/,5,4,"Hello everyone !

I will not consider myself a writer, just a person who thinks it may have interesting ideas which could be inked on a paper (to be considerred a writer imo is several levels above).

As in every new process, obstacles appear, and in this very case:

- when I'm inspired I can easily write several pages
- realisticaly, I saw that I cannot be inspired everyday
- therefore discipline is needed to continuously write 

The problem:

How can someone mantain the quality of inspiration written pages ? My fear is that those written in normal days will be dull and boring.

Is there a change that I'm overthinking and just starting to write will somehow click things inside my mind and create genuine quality ?"
