Does inspiration ever hit you in the shower?,Logical_Union_425,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/17nqxua/does_inspiration_ever_hit_you_in_the_shower/,28,28,"There are times when an entire scene I’ve been struggling with knits itself together perfectly when I’m showering and I’m just dripping all over the place scrambling to write it down before I lose it. It’s so frustrating because I almost always lose the perfect phrasing I was holding onto and it takes so long to figure it out again. 
Anyone else?"
