My[28 M] wife[26 F] thinks she may be a lesbian. I don't know how to be supportive while also protecting myself.,Kastdog,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6mvnip/my28_m_wife26_f_thinks_she_may_be_a_lesbian_i/,182,223,"I want to start by saying that I love my wife dearly, she is my best friend and I only want the best for her. We dated for 10 years and have now been married almost a year. Over the last year she has (self-admittedly) been irritable and critical of me and our relationship (i.e. we have been fighting a ton). It has absolutely been the worst year of our relationship despite the fact that we got married and the expectation is that is should be one of the best. This decline seems to have started with her admission to me that she also likes girls. This was a surprise to me as she has never indicated to me before that she was bisexual or had a sexual interest in women. When she told me this she assured me that she still loved me and was sexually attracted to me. That was the end of it. Fast forward to the beginning of June 2017 and she expressed that she was now questioning her sexuality and was concerned that she may be a lesbian. 


When she told me this I tried to be supportive and told her that I would be there for her in any way I could. I just wanted her to find peace and better understand her sexual orientation. She also started seeing a therapist that specializes in LGBTQ+ issues. Over the past month this has seemed to help her overall mood and she is definitely more positive than I have seen her since before our wedding. The downside to this is that she has tested the waters to see how I would feel if she hooked up/had sex/etc.. with another women. This would be to find out if she was actually sexually attracted to women or if it was purely a fantasy of hers. This has also been supported by her therapist with the phrasing being, more or less, ""How will you know until you know?"". 


This is where I am concerned. What am I supposed to do? Just let her go to a gay bar and pick up/get picked up by a women? Would it be her entering into a relationship or a one night stand? What are the rules? Only kissing? Full sex? Sex multiple times with the same partner? Sex multiple time with different partners? She hasn't come to me with a plan. She insists that she doesn't want to leave me and she feels more hopeful than ever about our relationship.


How do I be supportive of her while also not sacrificing my own happiness while she finds herself? To use an analogy, I feel like a dog that is being told to sit & stay by the owner with no guarantee that the owner will ever come back.
