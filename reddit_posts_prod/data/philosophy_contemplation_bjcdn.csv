Well, I am meeting him again at IHOP on Monday. 

Here are the posts:

After a month of contemplation, I have come to the conclusion that his god is a book.  His entire metaphysical philosophy is based on the Bible, which he worships as complete, absolute and literal truth.  This is where I will try to lead the discussion. If any redditor has a good question or argument for me, I will eagerly use it.

Please keep in mind that although I have very deep and personal opinions of his worldview, I consider him a friend.  He is also a kind and very well educated person.  I think of him as an anomaly among philosophy professors and am deeply curious as to why he clings so tightly to ideas that most of us find primitive or just plain absurd.  This is not necessarily about his theistic views, but more about his belief that the Bible is literal fact."
