"When a modern A.I., such as IBM's Watson, ""reads a book"", or any other text, what is that program doing with/to that text?",awkpeng,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/58nz3v/when_a_modern_ai_such_as_ibms_watson_reads_a_book/,14,50,"A few weeks ago a 60 minutes piece on AI suggested that Watson read thousands of books in an incredibly short period of time. What exactly does that mean? In my mind it could be that the system is just placing it in a database? It could also mean that its running it through a filtering algorithm and assigning subject matter titles to it or plucking out supposedly important sentences? How does it process the words, sentences, and paragraph's of the work and then how it uses them later on?

Edit:  Thank you all for your great answers. "
