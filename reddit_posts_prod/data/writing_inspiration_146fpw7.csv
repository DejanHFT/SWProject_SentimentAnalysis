What Quotes Inspire you to write?,bleepusbeepus,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/146fpw7/what_quotes_inspire_you_to_write/,8,7,"these can be famous quotes from successful authors, or surprisingly thoughtful quotes from your favourite tv show. the key is that it makes you want to grab a pen/ keyboard/typewriter etc, and write! Many books have these quotes included below chapter titles or at the start of the book. One that i absolutely love is:

To see a world in a grain of sand
Heaven in a wild flower
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand
And eternity in an hour

-William Blake

What about you?"
