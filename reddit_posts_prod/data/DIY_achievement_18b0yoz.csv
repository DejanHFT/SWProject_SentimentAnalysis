Beginner Help - Trying to cut / stain / seal butcher block outdoors... what outdoor conditions are too harsh?,RiskyBiscuit25,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/18b0yoz/beginner_help_trying_to_cut_stain_seal_butcher/,0,0,"I'm finishing a butcher block (to be used as a desk, the usual these days). Dove WAY too deep in the various furniture finishing options and decided on the straight-forward stain / poly approach... BUT potentially have a bigger and different problem?

&#x200B;

TL;DR  How serious is the ""stain and seal within 48hrs of opening"" step for butcher block? My work area for cutting, staining & sealing is a covered porch, exposed to the outside environment. Currently and for the next few days, that environment is partly cloudy, \~50-60F, with 60 - 89% (low to high daily avg) humidity. Should I wait until better conditions before taking any steps, since it will require overnight/multi-day drying, or is it worse to let the wood hang out unsealed in the house past the 48 hr mark? Thinking too much??

Side note: if there is a simpler or less toxic approach to finishing (potentially one I could do in a room indoors; but safe enough for an infant sleeping in another room), while also achieving ""desk durability"" I'd love to hear it."
