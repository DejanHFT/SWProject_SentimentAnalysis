"Reddit, will you help me play a game that is something of an experiment?",flameofmemories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10msh0/reddit_will_you_help_me_play_a_game_that_is/,10359,1538,"Here's how it works. You leave a comment describing (to a degree of specificity of your choosing), a person. And if someone reading this thread matches your description, they will respond to your comment saying so.

This is inspired by the thought that there is no such thing as a truly original idea. I'm curious to see how many obscure people we can think of that actually exist out there.

Here are a few people I would like to find:

~~-someone who only drinks alcohol when they are ill~~

~~-someone who eats mustard, by itself, purely for the flavor~~ ok ok, so a lot of people like mustard. I get it.

There are no rules about the kind of description you can make. It can involve age, locale, profession, interests, quirks, etc etc. The more obscure the better?

EDIT: found both of mine. Thanks Reddit! Hope many of you were surprised by the variety of people that are out there."
