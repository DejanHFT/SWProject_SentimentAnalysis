How to rewire doorbell for double chime?,whitedogseek,https://i.redd.it/1lxxzjqge6jb1.jpg,8,3,"I have a old school wired doorbell tied to two doorbell buttons/doors. I removed the 2nd door so only one button is needed. I replaced the old doorbell and can achieve a single “ding,” but I believe there is a way I can rewire at the bell or transformer to achieve a “ding-dong.” Anyone know the wiring to make this happen? Pictured is the wiring to the doorbell. Thanks!"
