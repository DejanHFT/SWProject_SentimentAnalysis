For those looking for a well-structured aesthetic routine (beginner through advanced) - Fierce 5,elohellscrub,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2jqox8/for_those_looking_for_a_wellstructured_aesthetic/,41,133,"http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=162916931

These are pretty popular on the bodybuilding.com forum but I've never seen them mentioned here. I'm currently running the PPL and really enjoy it. The full body and upper/lower split lack conventional deads for reasons that the author explains in the comments, though they are included in the PPL and PHAT variants. There are many options for strength training out there commonly discussed, so I just thought I would throw this out there for those more interested in physique. I also much prefer this PPL to coolcicada's, which I know many people are aware of."
