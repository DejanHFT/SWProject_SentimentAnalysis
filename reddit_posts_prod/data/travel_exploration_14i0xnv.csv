Is it possible to explore Asia if you have a soy allergy?,DivergentKing1,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/14i0xnv/is_it_possible_to_explore_asia_if_you_have_a_soy/,7,1,"Hi all! 

Recently I was talking to my wife about places we wanted to travel to, and she mentioned that she has always wanted to go see Tokyo. Unfortunately she has a very severe soy allergy and we are unsure how safe she would be given that a majority of food in Asia is made with soy. However, given that soy is one of the top 7 allergens in the world, we figured we would reach out to see if anyone else has gone to Asia with a soy allergy to see what they did to stay safe on their trip. Advice from everyone is welcomed and appreciated."
