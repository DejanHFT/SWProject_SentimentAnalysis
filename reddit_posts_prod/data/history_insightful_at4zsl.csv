Books on Fascism,Dakkadakka127,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/at4zsl/books_on_fascism/,14,9,"Hi friends!
Was trying to do some research on Fascism and I was wondering what primary sources were best?
I’ve read Mein Kampf, and while very insightful into the mind of Hitler, that was of course on *National Socialism* rather than actual fascism. If I recall, Mussolini wrote a pamphlet (?) but I can’t remember for the life of me of the actual title.
Also, I was wondering if Franco or any of his officials had a book on the ideology of Falangism.
Similarly, and minor fascists who have books on what Fascism actually is would be extremely helpful.
Thank you and I appreciate it :)
