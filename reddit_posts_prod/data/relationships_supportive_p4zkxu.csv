Friend (F30) is depressed and I (F30) am having issues being supportive while maintaining boundaries,butteringalmonds,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/p4zkxu/friend_f30_is_depressed_and_i_f30_am_having/,1,0,"(Tl;Dr at the bottom. Please don't repost this anywhere else).

So I have this friend whom I've known for about 10 years now. She's had a difficult life, and suffers from clinical depression, anxiety, abandonment issues, and anger management problems. She has few friends and unsupportive parents. Let's call her Kaye.

We don't live in the same country anymore (big time zone difference) and we don't chat particularly often, but she reached out recently due to a fallout she had with a close friend and former colleague. Long story short, Kaye misunderstood her friend's intentions in a texted conversation and lashed out at her using some very harsh and hurtful language. Now her friend, as well as another mutual friend, stopped speaking to her. Kaye apologized fairly quickly but there was no response to that apology. 

I've seen the text exchange and honestly it was quite harsh and seemingly out of nowhere. I understand Kaye's mentality can get very dark and warps reality, and this is even more so when she's under a lot of stress. In her point of view at the time, she was looking for a particular kind of support, and when her friend was innocently not providing it, she took it as a lack of care about her wellbeing and lashed out. 

Now she's been in this cycle of either blaming herself and feeling like a bad person, or saying that her friends left her because she no longer works in the same company and therefore cannot help them the way she used to. Like it's this weird bounce between accountability and then blaming outside forces. 

When I first heard about the issue, I did my best to hear her out and provide resources to help with her mental health issues. (She wants to get therapy again but it's very difficult where she is right now, money is very tight.) I sent her links to several support groups to help her feel less alone and to help with her struggles. I said my door is open as well. I initially understood that she knew she caused the rift in the relationship with her words and that all she could do now was work on herself. Her friends' reactions aren't within her control but she can control how she reacts in the future.

I should add that she wrote a longer detailed apology to her friend but hasn't sent it. I read that apology and it was good about saying where her head was at the time and asking for forgiveness but also giving her friend space to respond or not respond at all. I don't know why she hasn't sent it. I think she said that the short apology she sent on WhatsApp wasn't even seen so she didn't want to send more?

But it's been weeks now and she's sending messages referring to them leaving because she can't help them anymore, or wondering if they miss her at all. I know this is not due to any communication with them as that's been non existent for a while now. 

It's a strange cycle that goes nowhere and I don't know how to help anymore. It feels like whatever we talked about before was built on a foundation that barely exists.

Like...I understand there's a lot of grief involved when you've lost a friend. And she doesn't have good coping mechanisms, so she doesn't want to face the reality of having sabotaged a good thing so she'll blame outside forces for it to give herself a break from beating herself up about it. 

I also know very little about this friendship beyond what she's told me and I know these fallouts don't exist in a vacuum. Kaye has lashed out at me too--never to the extent she did with her friend--but I've seen this side to her before. If her friend no longer wishes to speak to her after having such a close relationship, I assume this wasn't the first time this happened. 

My issue is I want to support her but like at an arm's length. I feel like I've seen her true colors in terms of how she treats her friends when her emotions get the better of her, and there's little in the way of active accountability. I don't want that BS aimed at me if I can help it. 

Another problem is we have a mutual friend of our own and I don't want to cause a rift in the relationship between the three of us.

How do I respond to these self-pitying vague messages without getting annoyed at her and while maintaining the peace? 

Tl;Dr: Friend, Kaye, lashed out at another friend of hers  and came asking for support. I gave Kaye that and advice  while believing we both understood she was in the wrong. Now it seems like she is playing the victim and being self-pitying. I don't want to be harsh to her to maintain the peace between us and another mutual friend but her lack of consistency is hard to deal with."
