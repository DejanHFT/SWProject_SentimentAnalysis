Too Scared to Be Creative,Pineapple_Herder,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/gr4mfg/too_scared_to_be_creative/,6,2,"It's weird but my creativity has stifled HARD since high school. I can't get my emotions on paper anymore. I lock up. My self-esteem and my connection to my feelings has poisoned my creative drive. If I try to express myself in a drawing... I can't help but feel unsafe. That others will see it, but I want to build my future on my art. I know my skills are decent but in shifting from private work to commercial, I've just lost touch with myself. I need to be able to put my feelings into a piece to give it life but that means putting my feelings in front of others; Even if realistically they would probably never notice them or even be able to connect the pieces to my life's current events. I know a lot of this stems from my toxic family and the lasting effects they have had on my sense of self that has resulted in my muting my emotions and opinions and in doing so my creativity. When I was younger, I felt accepted for drawing. It was normal for teenagers to draw; Regardless of skill. Now as an adult I've put so much pressure into having to be ""good enough"" and separating myself from my commercial art. I feel shame for drawing as an adult because if it's not beautiful or polished then it's childish and unacceptable. I can't shake these irrational feelings.

I'm overflowing with a desire to express myself but can't possibly put it out into the world for fear of being judged. I envy artists who can put their feelings in a piece and then ship out into the world with a kiss and goodbye ready to withstand the critiques. How do you guys do it? Can any of you relate to this?

Thank you for your time and apologies if this is a bit off topic."
