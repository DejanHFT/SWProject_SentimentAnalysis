Looking for a medium scale warfare strategy game,Dynamite_Noir,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/144g3vk/looking_for_a_medium_scale_warfare_strategy_game/,13,0,"I am looking to find out what a medium scale warfare strategy game would be. HOI4 is big picture and I have a few hundred hours in it but it is what I would describe as Large scale. On the other end, I see company of heroes as small scale, if that makes sense. I don't want to be ordering individual squads or units around, but I also don't want to just assign a division template to a 'province' and let the game calculations figure it out.  


What I am looking for would be something on the level of the Ukranian conflict where I am controlling brigade levels at the largest size and down to battalions or companies at the smallest. A game where I am essentially only ever looking at managing a field army at most. Looking for where I need to sort out how the best way to defend or lay siege to a strategic city.  


Does a game like that exist and which one would it be?"
