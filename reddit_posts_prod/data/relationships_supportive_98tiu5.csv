I'm trying very hard to be a supportive and healthy partner to someone who is struggling, and it results in my own struggle.  We often have conversations that start out her asking me to hear her out and give her support on something that's troubling her or making her anxious, and I try really hard, but we often end up with her angry at me and calling me unemotional, mean, and cruel.  She is usually able to tell me what it was that I said that upset her, but I'm never able to anticipate what it might be, and it's always something I have said with the full intention of being in the moment and on her team.  I fear that I just don't understand or can't tell where her emotional pain-points are going to be moment-to-moment.  I want to believe her and accept her feelings as valid, but I just can't seem to keep her wants and needs straight enough to keep from blundering into a fight.

We're both in therapy for a variety of things, but it's hard and progress is slow.

I fear I will never understand, never make it as a good partner for her, and as long as we're together I'll be miserable just trying to keep up.  I don't know what kind of changes I need to make to be able to survive all this.

**tl;dr** I try to be a supportive partner, but no matter what I do she tells me I'm doing it wrong, and it sucks for both of us.  How can I change/do better?

edit: I appreciate the comments so far. I wish I could say that it's helping, but honestly I just feel more confused, and I don't know whether or not I should talk to her about this post. I did this for me, and I'm kind of glad I did, but airing this laundry feels very vulnerable."
