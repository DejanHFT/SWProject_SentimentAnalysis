"My GF and I would love to have a ""Bubble Tent."" What materials could achieve something like this? [examples inside]",nessx007,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/10t49n/my_gf_and_i_would_love_to_have_a_bubble_tent_what/,5,7,"Here's what we're looking at (google has more):

Obviously, we'd like to avoid ordering one (though some I've found in the $300-$500 range) but I'm not sure where to start otherwise. They use a pump to keep the thing inflated, but I'm not sure how easy that kind of plastic is to work with at home. It doesn't have to be too fancy (the furniture inside seems like a bit much, and I could live without a tube entry), but we'd love something similar to these especially to use in the rain. I'd be happy even with a severely jerry-rigged finished product so long as it worked!

Any tips or leads would be great, thanks!"
