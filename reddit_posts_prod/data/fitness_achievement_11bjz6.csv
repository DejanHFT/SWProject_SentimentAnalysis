My great squat achievement (or: suggestions for exertion headaches?),stieruridir,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/11bjz6/my_great_squat_achievement_or_suggestions_for/,7,1,"Tuesday, after hitting my max for the day (335, deloading a bit), I decided to do a set of 50x165 (my bodyweight) instead of my normal 20x260.  20 went fine, as it should, 30 was starting to be shitty, thought I'd stop at 40. Hit 40, went 'Fuck it, it's only ten more' and did my whole 50. So yeah, great achievement, 50 reps at 165.

Then I was woozy and had to sit down, could barely walk, had a headache the rest of the day (that turned into a migraine at 9:30pm at night from pooping), and two days later (today) when I went to go bench it returned in full force and I had to lay down for a bit at work.

Suggestions for dealing with an exertion headache?"
