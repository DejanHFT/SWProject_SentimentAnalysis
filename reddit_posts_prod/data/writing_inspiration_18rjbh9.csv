When does inspiration cross a line?,swizzleedoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18rjbh9/when_does_inspiration_cross_a_line/,1,0,"Hey all,

I have had an idea for a novel that came to me while I was taking a dance class. The more I sifted through it I felt some notes of Phantom of the Opera and then that helped connect some threads in my head about how the story could be completed. I am an unpublished author, but I would love to indie publish on KU or something similar just to share my words with people one day when I feel like it's finished. I know we are all inspired by various things, can anyone help explain more about what I should know when there are similar themes to classic novels or you are writing an adaption? How do you proceed with writing? "
