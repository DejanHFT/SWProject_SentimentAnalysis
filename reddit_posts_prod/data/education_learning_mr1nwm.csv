"If a high school student fails most of their classes during remote learning, what are their options?",InVodkaVeritas,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/mr1nwm/if_a_high_school_student_fails_most_of_their/,26,38,"This is a general question with specific background.  

Main question is: regardless of circumstances, if a student bombs the remote learning year, what are their options?  Can they repeat the year?  Can they withdraw on the remainder of the year and try again next year?  Do they just have to drop out and get their GED?

Specific Circumstances: Freshman in high school with a diagnosed learning disability (severe ADHD) and divorced parents who both work full time.  The kid had an IED in middle school but none was provided in high school.  Parents requested support from the school throughout the year but didn't really get any specialized help throughout the year.  Kid has failed 3 of 5 classes already and is failing 3 of 5 in their second term, on path to failing 6 of 10 classes for their Freshman year. 

The parents feel pretty abandoned by the school, and their ADHD Freshman is home alone during the day for remote learning.  No amount of pressure, rewards, punishments, etc worked for them to get their kid to passing level and the school provided no tutoring or special support to help.

Right now parents are wanting to just pull their kid from school for the rest of the year and have them restart Freshman year next year, but that likely isn't kosher with the government.  They are frustrated and feel like the public school system abandoned their kid and now it'll end up being 3 years of intensity trying to make up for freshman year failures, and that their kid really missed out on getting 4 proper years of schooling that they needed to do well in school.

They are currently looking at private school options and other high schools in the district.  What are the options in this specific, and in the general case of when a kid just bombs their Freshman year?"
