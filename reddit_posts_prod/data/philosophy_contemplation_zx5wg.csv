"""We are the universe experiencing itself"" Proven? You decide.",CoffeeShopPhilosophr,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/zx5wg/we_are_the_universe_experiencing_itself_proven/,20,0,"It has been said that ""We are the universe experiencing itself"" but can this be true? In this argument I set out to both understand and prove that we are in fact the universe experiencing itself. After doing so I contemplate what the difference is between dream and reality and conclude that not only are we the universe experiencing itself, but we too are experiencing ourselves through the universe. I don't claim perfection, but I feel I've made a strong argument and I want to engage others in this discussion I've been having with myself. I know this can get thick at times, suggestions for improving clarity would be welcomed as well.

The universe I shall define as a term we use to describe everything that exists. For to determine existence we must set a ""boundary"" or a limit so that we may understand existence from non-existence. And if we are to exist we must be contained within existence, therefore we must be contained within the universe. But we alone are not the universe, yet we are ""of"" the universe. Descartes reasons that at least some part of us must exist by considering that while our senses may be deceived and may not themselves exist the fact that we are aware of them means there is a part of us that can be deceived and deception cannot occur without our (mind) first existing (Descartes Meditations). If we believe and accept and trust Descartes' reasoning we accept that we exist and we are capable of ""experience"", for to experience is to exist and to exist is to experience. It is not sufficient on the basis of the possibility of the ability to be deceived that we can be deceived out of our own existence, for if we are deceived we must exist. However, the fact that we have experiences, whether subject to deception or not, is sufficient to exist. Our experiences are contained within our existence and our existence is contained within the universe. Our experiences are of us as we are of the universe and our experiences are of the universe because to experience something it must too exist and to exist it must be contained within the universe. Therefore to exist we must experience and to have an experience it must be of the universe and as we are of the universe and the universe is the whole of our experiences the universe is us through our experiences. Thus, as we are of the universe and to exist we must experience the universe, we are the universe and the universe is experiencing itself through us.

So the question of distinguishing between dreams and reality is irrelevant. For dreams and reality are our experiences. As a condition of our existence we must experience otherwise we cannot be certain we exist. Whether our experiences be of dreams or reality they are nonetheless an experience and it is also true that if they are an experience they must be of the universe and if they are of the universe they must exist, for the universe contains all of existence. As dreams and reality are the expression of our experiences they can be said to be of us as we are of the universe and to be of us is to compose us. Therefore we are simultaneously our dreams and reality as they are our experiences and our experiences compose us as our existence composes the universe. And to separate dreams from reality is to separate ourselves and just as something cannot be said to exist and not exist at the same time we cannot be said to be whole and separate at the same time. And if we cannot separate dreams and reality then they must be one and the same. Therefore, whether dream or reality, deception or truth, they are the same: experiences. And to be an experience is to exist within the universe and to be of the universe and thus of existence.

As dreams and reality are one and the same and are both experiences and we are experiences and experiences are of us and we are of the universe we all must exist within the universe. And to exist we must experience and if our dreams and reality are both experiences and both one and the same our dreams are our reality and our reality is our dreams. And we must accept our experiences in order to exist as choosing not to accept our experiences is to choose not to exist and to ""choose"" is to experience ""choice"" and therefore to exist. Thus our dreams and reality are our experiences and are of us and we must accept all experiences to exist as we are of the universe and the universe must accept us in order to exist. 

And even when we cannot experience any longer we still have experienced and to have experienced is to have existed and to have existed is to have been of the universe and to be of the universe is to be the universe. And just as to separate dreams and reality is to separate ourselves and make ourselves not whole we cannot separate ourselves from the universe for to do so is to make the universe separate and not whole. And the universe, to be our boundary between existence and non-existence, cannot itself both exist and not exist thus we must accept that we are one and the same as the universe. And the universe is the entirety of existence and as we are the universe we are the entirety of existence. And to be the entirety of existence is to be forever and eternal, thus the universe must be forever and eternal and we too must be forever and eternal for we are the universe. And if we are the universe experiencing itself and we are the universe then we are simply experiencing ourselves through the universe. We are thus forever and eternal, we are one and we are all, we are all that exists and all that can exist, we are existence itself."
