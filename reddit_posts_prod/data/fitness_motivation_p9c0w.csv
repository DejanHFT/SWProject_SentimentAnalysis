Losing motivation?,bravesaint,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/p9c0w/losing_motivation/,29,16,"Hey all, new to /r/fitness but happy to have found this place.
So basically, I've been overweight most of my adult life (well, 22 y/o now) and now it's finally gotten really, really out of control. Joined a few forums and starting doing research about lifting/eating/etc. and after a little over a month, I'm down about 15lbs. Main problem I'm having is that after a few really good days of eating my cals and lifting, I lose all motivation, say fuck it, and binge eat or just completely give up on it. 

For any of you big guys out here, what helped you stay motivated during the beginning? I'm proud of the progress I've made, but know I can make wayyy better if I didn't take all these steps back. Thanks!"
