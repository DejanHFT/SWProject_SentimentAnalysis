Adventure in Puerto Rico,AUSTIN_NIMBY,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/rl4jwh/adventure_in_puerto_rico/,7,2,"I’m looking for a one day adventure activity for the guys in central PR or east of San Juan. Some things we thought of are fishing, kayaking, rafting, or hiking. 

Is there any other activity that would be fun? We are all in our late 30’s, very active/in-shape. Doesn’t need to be extreme but something more than a family friendly tour would be nice. Thanks."
