I finally got inspiration for my first novel.,PlairinumYT,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/16ek27o/i_finally_got_inspiration_for_my_first_novel/,6,29,"So, I decided to write a book about a story I came up with while daydreaming. It was a crime fiction, with a little bit of sci-fi elements in it. I outlined the chapters, had like a world built in my mind, but when I wrote it, it just didn't come together. (I know about first drafts, and this is my first book, but even after trying to edit it and looking up advice online it was turning out how I imagined in it my head.) So, I scrapped the idea and looked for something else. All I knew about my new idea was the crime was going to be an armed robbery.

So, I looked at Payday. A video game all about armed robberies. I looked at what inspired Payday. I couldn't really come up with anything, but a level is based off of the movie Heat. So, I looked at what Heat was about, and heat was inspired by a true story of a cop and a career criminal playing cat and mouse. One famous thing they did was talking to each other in a coffee shop and they formed a mutual respect.

This reminded me of a play I watched called Catch Me if You Can. In this play the FBI agent becomes like really good friends with the criminal while he's still a criminal. But the crime that was committed was fraud. So, my book is going to take a spin on that story were instead of fraud, it's armed robberies. I am excited to plan out and outline this book. And hopefully I can pull the other idea out of the trash bin someday and make it into a book someday."
