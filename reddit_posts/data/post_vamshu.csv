Spacesuit Research Recommendations,Inatorcreator,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/vamshu/spacesuit_research_recommendations/,4,2,"I am an aerospace engineering major (Junior) working on a summer project to build a functioning LCG (Liquid Cooling Garment) made to be used outdoors for working in hot climates. While I already have most of it built, I still have a lot to learn and have developed a deep interest in spacesuits and how they manage the flow of energy and mass through a human body. Does anyone have any recommendations for books/articles/papers on space suit design that would extend my knowledge on this subject? Books I am considering so far are, ""Lunar Outfitters: Making the Apollo Space Suit,"" and,"" Space Suit: Fashioning Apollo.""

Thanks!"
