Should market saturation affect critique?,Talvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/wtbiv0/should_market_saturation_affect_critique/,12,6,"Do you think movies deserve to be reviewed in a vacuum, or should things like market saturation (eg. an otherwise good superhero flick being unoriginal at the time) affect consensus on whether a movie is actually good or not? Is a good film bad if it comes out at the wrong time? How objective or subjective is this as a metric, and does it matter?"
