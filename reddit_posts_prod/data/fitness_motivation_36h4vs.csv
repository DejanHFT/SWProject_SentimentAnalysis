Motivation on a Tuesday morning,DaveTheOneAndOnly,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/36h4vs/motivation_on_a_tuesday_morning/,35,170,"My fitness journey started 3 months ago when I decided for my own personal health I wanted to truly get in shape. I went from 335lbs down to 280(and still going strong). Yesterday at my gym an older gentleman approached me while I was deadlifting, he identified himself as the owner of the establishment and a fitness enthusiast himself. He took the time out of his day to let me know he remembers when I started working out there and was amazed and impressed with the progress I've made. Now my own personal health and well-being has always been my motivation but for a complete stranger to take time to pass on a few kind words affected me more than I thought it would. 

Edit: made the front page! And thank you all for the overwhelming positivity but this wasn't about me, this is about the stranger who took the time out of his day to tell someone they were impressed. For those of you that notice fellow gym goers making positive changes I encourage you to do the same! I know I sure as hell will! "
