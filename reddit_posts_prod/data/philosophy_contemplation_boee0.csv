Why is it worth doing?,feedthetrolls,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/boee0/why_is_it_worth_doing/,5,0,"I'm having a bit of a quarter-life crisis.  I'm in my third year of a computer science degree, but I'm finding I'm enjoying my classes and work less every day.  Finals have rolled around, and I can barely motivate myself to study.  I'm contemplating dropping out of science, and just switching to an arts degree.

I guess when it comes down to it, I just don't understand why I should keep putting the effort required into getting a science degree when I could study something like English or Philosophy, and spend my days either reading or writing fantastic stories, or blazing and thinking about the meaning of life.  Compared to my CS degree, I'm sure the workload wouldn't be a problem, so my otherwise suffering GPA would even improve were I to do this, which I'm sure would get my folks off my back...

I figure this is right up your area of expertise, guys, so: why shouldn't I just take the easy way out?"
