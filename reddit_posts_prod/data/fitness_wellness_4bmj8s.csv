"Well, that was disappointing.",zeekar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4bmj8s/well_that_was_disappointing/,5,1,"Sorry if this is inappropriate; didn't quite find a match in the wiki. 

I've been touring the gym machines with a trainer for a few weeks, today we finally got to bench presses, and I was able to press... a whopping 25% of my (rather overweight) body weight.  I didn't even know it was *possible* to be so weak. Especially since I seem to have pretty good bicep strength, but I guess that's not a good correlation. 

So now what?  Focus on the bench to get better at it?  Set it aside and work on other things instead?  My goal is mainly weight loss with some muscle mass buildup for metabolism and overall fitness; I'm not trying to bulk up. How important is the bench in that situation?

I mean, I knew I was out of shape. And I know that numbers only matter relative to my own progress.  But that particular number really threw me for a loop."
