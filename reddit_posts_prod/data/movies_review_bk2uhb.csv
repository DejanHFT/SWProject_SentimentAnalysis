'Detective Pikachu' - Review Thread,BunyipPouch,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/bk2uhb/detective_pikachu_review_thread/,922,944,"Review embargo just lifted on Ryan Reynolds' Detective Pikachu. Reviews are looking pretty good/okay/mixed/mediocre so far, decent-ish for a video game adaptation. Nobody hates it, nobody *loves* it. More positives than negatives so far. This will probably still be overshadowed by Endgame when it releases though.

> After 21 handdrawn cartoon features, the Pokémon phenomenon finally gets a radical bigscreen reinvention as a live-action/computer-animated hybrid.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/pokemon-detective-pikachu-review-1207169)

> The ridiculously persistent craze just got a little crazier. Those anticipating another Golden Raspberry-worthy contender like last year’s The Happytime Murders, another spoof of classic pulp fiction, can park their preconceived notions at the door. It turns out Pokemon Detective Pikachu isn’t half bad.

[Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movie-reviews/2019/05/02/pokemon-detective-pikachu-review/)

> Pokemon Detective Pikachu is an exhausting gumball noir whose cuteness gets old fast. As the wisecracking voice of Pikachu, Ryan Reynolds deserves some sort of special citation for doing the best he can without Deadpool’s f-bombs (or a decent script) to lean on.

> The Pokémon Adaptation Uses Heartfelt Nostalgia – It’s Mostly Effective!

[The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18525323/detective-pikachu-review-pokemon)

> An absurdly silly, wonderful ride. This isn’t The Pokémon Movie, but it’s not trying to be.

[Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/2/18527380/detective-pikachu-review-pokemon)

> Detective Pikachu does justice to Pokémon. The world of Pokémon comes alive. That awe can be exciting and explosive in the thick of battle, but more often than not, it’s quiet and mundane, like having to strap your Pikachu into a car’s booster seat. The biggest compliment I can give Detective Pikachu is that it didn’t take long for me to wish I could live in it.

[Indiewire](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/05/pokemon-detective-pikachu-review-ryan-reynolds-1202130470/)

> Pokémon World Comes to Vivid Life in Disappointing Adaptation. The Pokemons are adorable and the effects are fantastic, but the first live-action Pokémon movie is oddly flat and strangely confusing.

[Collider](http://collider.com/detective-pikachu-review/)

> See Detective Pikachu for the Pokémon, not the plot. Rating: C-

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/detective-pikachu-pokemon-film-review-ryan-reynolds-2019-jungleguts/)

> Problems Come Out to Play in Disappointing Film. Unfortunately, the mechanics that often make a video game fun and meaningful don’t always translate to a good story

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/03/pokemon-detective-pikachu-review)

> Despite the film industry’s resistance to video game movies, Pokémon: Detective Pikachu has landed a critical hit. Sure, not everything goes off without a hitch, but the lifelike Pokémon provide a nonstop stream of delights to make the weaker aspects of the movie forgivable.

[Screencrush](https://screencrush.com/detective-pikachu-movie-review/)

> Beneath the predictable story, Detective Pikachu isn’t about much, and if you need Wikipedia to explain who Mewtwo is, most of the jokes will go right over your head. The whole thing is a bit too childish for adults, and a bit too convoluted for kids. It absolutely deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects however, even if the subject matter makes me think it’s unlikely to receive one. 

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/03/pokemon-detective-pikachu-review-ryan-reynolds-grabs-film-by-scruff-of-the-neck)

> Ryan Reynolds grabs film by scruff of the neck. The inspired casting of the Deadpool actor transforms this from an average Pokémon movie into fun family fare. Three stars.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/detective-pikachu-review/)

> Reynolds and Pikachu make an inspired combo in a CGI/live-action mash-up that otherwise adheres to a rigidly boilerplate formula. 

[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2019/05/03/pokemon-detective-pikachu-review-ryan-reynolds-pretty-much-only-draw/3652411002/)

> Pikachu is like the supreme A-lister of this creature crowd and he’s an adorable hoot. The movie sings when Pikachu is running afoul of an irked Charizard or playing the world’s cutest sleuth. Reynolds’ voice has a natural snarkiness that electrifies Pikachu’s personality, though there’s also a heartwarming timbre that’ll make you love him more, if that's possible. While the pint-sized Sherlock gives “Detective Pikachu” heart and soul, the rest of the film lacks its title character’s verve.
