New Zealand - Exploring the South Island,halotoppbcup,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16nenm1/new_zealand_exploring_the_south_island/,8,4,"Hi everyone!

I (29F) will be travelling solo from the states to New Zealand in November for 12 days. I’ll be spending the first three days in Auckland, and the next two days in Wellington. After that, I’ll catch my flight to the South Island where I plan to stay for the remainder of the trip until I return to Auckland for my flight home. 

I wanted to get some opinions on whether it would make sense to make Queenstown my primary base for the entirety of my time on the south island. Are there any areas I would miss out on by staying in Queenstown exclusively? 

I pretty social, so I’m okay with spending some time in the city and getting to know the locals. But I’m also very interested in hiking and site seeing and don’t want to miss out on the must-sees!

Edited to include that I am open to travel from Queenstown by train or bus!"
