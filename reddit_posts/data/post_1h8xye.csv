"Programmers of Reddit, is code worth learning?",XFaithlessXBeholderX,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1h8xye/programmers_of_reddit_is_code_worth_learning/,44,14,"I say this because I'm conflicted on what I want to do as a potential job out of high school. I'm big into the sciences, but I can't fathom an actual career based on lab beakers, data sheets, and lab rats.

I've been a big tech junkie since I was little, and have started taking interest in the career paths that come with a technology degree/coding expertise.

Questions: 
-Is it worth the effort?
Coding seems tedious; high risk-high reward factor

-Have you made a profit/job opportunity with your programming skills?
Programming seems to have unlimited potential.

-Are you happy?
This is the most important question I can ask."
