Does soul and/or disco era music make anyone else melancholy?,nick3790,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/k73wrw/does_soul_andor_disco_era_music_make_anyone_else/,8,1,"I don’t know if this is exactly the place for this, but it’s the best I could find... I have a bit of a theory that the “groovier” music gets, or the more, idk, classic bubble letter “wackadaisical” a song is, the more it’s meant to sorta melt you. That sounds so abstract that I couldn’t be talking about anything but music, but does anyone else experience this? I feel like that sort of music is generally supposed to be something you dance to, and there are some powerful songs with a whole lot of soul or funk, I’ve just always felt so damn depressed when listening to that music. It feels almost like I’m at the height of a bad weed green out, I mean at least the “feeling” of it, the sorta headspace it puts me in..... the more I type the more this sounds like simple personal opinion/perspective, but I just wanted to see if it was common for people to experience these sounds in that melancholy way. (I also get a similar feeling with some modern lo-fi sounds)"
