How to be supportive & encouraging when I don’t like her writing?,throwrasleepingcats,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/u3ql08/how_to_be_supportive_encouraging_when_i_dont_like/,27,2,"I (26M) have been seeing this girl “Emily” (24F) for about a month now. It’s been fucking incredible. She’s so sweet, so thoughtful, the sexual chemistry we have is out of this world. I love the way she makes me feel and I love that I can make her feel so good with the simplest things. If we didn’t live so far away from each other then we’d be in a committed relationship right now. We decided to take it slow since neither of us really wants to do long distance, but I’m honestly picturing this girl in my life long-term. As I think about the future with her, I realize we may run into a slight hurdle, and I want to get ahead of it. That’s where y’all come in. 

Emily currently works in a direct care position. She is extremely good at what she does but knows that she can’t do it forever because that role inevitably burns people out. She really wants to be a writer. She writes all the time (journals, poetry, short stories, etc.) and dreams about having her work published. 

I want to support her dreams and encourage her! The problem is… I don’t like her writing style. I’m an avid reader and have been all my life, I used to edit papers for extra cash, and I like to think I have an eye for good writing. I haven’t read much of her “work” but her texts can be confusing. She’ll misspell words badly, use the wrong form of “there”, there’ll be lots of run-on sentences, things like that. She’ll write long Facebook statuses that are huge chunks of text, using punctuation incorrectly, often rambling around the point. It can honestly be hard to read, to the point where I once wondered if she might have some sort of learning disability. (She has a bachelor’s degree, but mentioned that school was hard for her.) 

Normally I would never address this, because English is a fucked up colonial language with lots of arbitrary rules, and I genuinely believe that things like spelling & grammar are not important for casual written conversation so long as both parties can understand each other. I don’t need my partner to be Joan Didion or David Sedaris! But she’s been hinting at showing me some of the poems and short stories she’s been working on. This feels like a big deal since she’s private about her work and I want to respond in a way that’s supportive and encouraging! At the same time, I don’t want to lie to her and tell her I think it’s amazing if it’s not. (I’m a bad liar, she would know.) I’m afraid I’ll come off as really condescending if I offer ways she could “improve.” I can’t say that the content doesn’t interest me, because she knows it does. 

I imagine this might be similar to dating a musician whose music you don’t enjoy (even though you love other music in that genre). I want to handle this in a way that leaves her feeling loved, supported, and seen while not lying. 

TL;DR: I don’t like this girl’s writing style, how do I respond with support and encouragement for her dreams (without making her feel bad) when she shows me her work?"
