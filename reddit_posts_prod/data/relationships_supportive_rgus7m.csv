Hi everyone. Please excuse any English grammar errors (not my native language).

Me (31) and my boyfriend (29) have been together for a 2 and a half years. We\`ve had our ups&downs just like everybody else, but overall I would say we have a good relationship and we both are commited to each other. This is my first serious relationship in a long time (10 years) because until now I haven\`t date anybody (trust issues).

I love my boyfriend, but sometimes I feel like walking on eggshels with him. For example, recently we fought over a stupid topic: dental care. 

My boyfriend was worried that he has too many tooth cavities and started looking for dentists that could treat his problems. He called two random dental offices to ask about their pricelists, and then decided that it is too expensive and there is got to be a way to find a cheaper option. To which I replied that while he might find something more or less cheaper, dental care is still expensive and he should be prepared for that. It is the sad, but this is the reality. I know that since 3 years ago, when I had to pay a lot for my dental implants. It was a huge amount of money for me, but I have learned my lesson and now I am aware that neglecting dental problems can create huge expenses in the long run. 

Apparently, my boyfriend was upset about my opinion and we started to fight about this: he was saying he is not looking for the cheapest option available, but still is not willing to jump to the first expensive dental office. While this sounded reasonable, I was defending my opinion about the expensive dental market in our country and was also trying to explain that sometimes the final price depends on a lot of variables, such as the size of the cavity or the materials used in sealing/filling the cavity.

This discussion reminded me that I should also go check my teeth at my dentist, so I booked an appointment and went yesterday for a tooth extraction. I came home very happy and optimist about my experience (I am really confident about my dentist\`s skills). My boyfriend saw this and decided on the spot that he should also find a dentist and start working on his health problems. 

Minutes after that, my boyfriend said that he found a dental office close to us that have reasonable prices. He was scheduled for a quick consultation and he seemed optimist about that and somehow relieved.

I was happy too about this outcome and said to him that in the end was not so hard and I am glad that he booked and appoitment. To which he replied that indeed was not hard, but I was not supportive to him since the beggining and kind of discouraged him with my opinion about dental care being expensive.

I don\`t know why, but I was very hurt to hear that. In my opinion, I was nothing but supportive to him and helped as much as I could. I called my friends to ask them about their dentists\` pricelists and experiences, I explained to him why certain procedures are expensive. Apparently all this did not seem to matter to him.

He seemed like he moved on with this, but I still don\`t feel ok, it stings me badly. Perhaps he is right, perhaps I indeed was not supportive but rather discouraging? How can I get over that?"
