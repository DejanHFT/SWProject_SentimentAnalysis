The line between inspiration and rip off?,-Rho-Aias,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/togtci/the_line_between_inspiration_and_rip_off/,6,7,"So, I just watched The Batman movie, and while watching the first half of it, I kept thinking about the movie Seven. From the cinematography, to the story beats, it reminded me of that movie. 

It got me thinking about how people determine that line between inspiration and rip off. The line between okay and bad.

For instance, imagine there was this story that started off about an orphaned boy, who turns out to be a wizard and goes to a secret wizard school. But then it twists into some dark direction (no I'm not writing this xD).

Would people call this a rip off, because the beginning sounds very similar to another story, or is it considered inspiration, because the story uses those pieces to spin their own tale?

In your opinion and experience, how would you define that line? And if you have any examples let us know!"
