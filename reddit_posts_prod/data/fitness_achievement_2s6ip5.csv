I was a stick. Short, weak, a strong gust could've blown me over. [Here's me in college, about three years ago](http://i.imgur.com/h1b2jPM.jpg). No eating disorders, just always been really skinny.

I shattered my collarbone in August, and got hardware put in. It was right around this time I got a smack in the face from the firm hand of reality. I needed to be the best me I could possibly be. I don't want to be a twig. When October rolled around, my doctor gave me the go-ahead to start lifting.

I got a workout buddy, who had been doing this for almost a year already. We benched for the first time, and I put up 65 pounds 5 times. Feeling pitiful, but angry watching him throw up 160 with ease, I told him I would be benching my bodyweight by the end of the year.

""It's October. You think you're going to make that much progress in three months? Sketti-Os, there's a reason why most people aren't ripped. It's hard to do and it takes a *lot* of time and dedication. I like your drive, but let's set that goal for six months""

If it takes six months, it takes six months. But my goal is three, and I stuck by that.

Fast-forward to this morning.

I'm almost two weeks late, but I did it. I got a bit of help from whey and creatine, but going to the gym 6 days a week and giving it my all got me to achieve my goal. [I actually have meat on my bones, and look a lot healthier in general](http://i.imgur.com/PKJdX2V.jpg) (excuse the instagram grain).

**From here:** Really, just keeping at it. I'd like to find/take some proper before and after pictures. The ones I have here look like two completely different people, and not in a transformational way.

Most importantly, in the aspect of keeping at it, keep *learning*. This past 3-4 months has taught me more about myself than I've learned in the previous 3-4 years.

I don't want to say I've neglected my legs, as my weekly regimen was [push, pull, leg, push, pull, leg, rest], but I'll admit I haven't gone 110% on leg days. Leg days weren't bringing me closer to attaining my large goal, so the motivation wasn't there. I'd like to change that. Maybe my next large goal will be a squat weight."
