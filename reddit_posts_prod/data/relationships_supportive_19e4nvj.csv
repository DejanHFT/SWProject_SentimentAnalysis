I don't know how to support my friend,IngenuityNo1252,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19e4nvj/i_dont_know_how_to_support_my_friend/,0,1,"I (m23) have a really close friend (f22), me and her are friends online but hang out nearly every day. Recently I had a falling out with the rest of our friend group. Multiple things happened from one member of the group cheating on his girlfriend and then immediately bringing that new girl into the group, to talking about me behind my back and other behaviors I just wasn't okay with. We were running an TRPG game where I felt more and more that the people in that group were just using me for entertainment instead of actually wanting to be my friends. Eventually I left the group but stayed friends with with my close friend and another friend from the group (m20).

My close friend and the third friend continue to hang out and even started up a new TRPG game. I'm having a lot of fun with them. However, my third friend continues to hang out and be close with people in that group. I'm fine with this. I don't want to dictate who's friends with who. My third friend has recently been playing a bunch of co-op games with the old friend group and inviting my close friend to play with them. My close friend has a really hard time making new friends because she's very shy and very anxious about change. She asked me if it was okay if you played with them. I told her it was fine, because I felt fine. Like I didn't care at the time. But now I do.

The girlfriend who was cheated on (f20) always gave me vague warnings that I shouldn't try to get too close to some people in the group. She recently told me that that's because they didn't like me and would mock me when I wasn't around. I believe her given how some of these people treated me within the group. After I broke off from the group, apparently things got worse with how they viewed me. I've been told there was a bit where making fun of me was a common gag.  

I'm very conflicted here. On one hand. I don't care about that group anymore. They don't like me because they thought I was annoying. I don't like them because I felt like I was becoming a commodity of them instead of a friend. I didn't care that my third friend continued to hang out with them, he was closer with people in that group anyways. But now that my close friend is hanging out with them more and more, I can't help feel jealous. And I'm disgusted that I feel jealous. My close friend has such a hard time making friends. I'd feel horrible telling her how I feel knowing that she would fully drop the group. I also hate that so much of the time her and me would spend together is now eating up by this group playing games again. 

There's more details in nuance the situation, but it's taken me a while to even get the courage to speak up here. If you have questions, I'll try to answer them. My main question though is should I tell my close to you my friend about how I feel?

TL:DR I left a toxic friend group my shy friend still hangs out with the group. Do I tell her how I feel even though I know that will make her lose friends and it's hard for her to make friends."
