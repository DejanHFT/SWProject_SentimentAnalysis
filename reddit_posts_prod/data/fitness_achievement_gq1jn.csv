Achievement unlocked: weighted pullups. ,epitomeofamit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/gq1jn/achievement_unlocked_weighted_pullups/,44,19,"Just on a whim, I decided it would be fun to grab a dumbbell with my feet and do some pullups. I got a few sets with a 5kg dumbell, so I'd say not half bad. I'm around 60-65 kg atm. 

So all you weighted pull upers, how do you guys do it? What kind of set/rep scheme have you found works well? Do you use linear progression like your other lifts?"
