"Me [34M] with my GF [31F] of 4.5 years, money issues, support fatigue and frustration.",MyThrowawayStuff2018,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8lrb6o/me_34m_with_my_gf_31f_of_45_years_money_issues/,153,517,"Hi All,

Throwaway account here and its a late night, I may ramble but I need to get this out there (with plenty of backstory).

We met 4.5 years ago, we both had high paying jobs and were busy people, her more than me. She got sick of her corporate structure and changed industries, requiring a relocation which worked out great for me as I found a better job in the new city. 

After 6 months she quits new job and becomes a yoga instructor. Fast forward another 2 years, we have bought a house (in my name due to her income) and shes now struggling for money and trying to grow her business, I fund the mortgage, a lot of the bills, meals, etc. 

1 year later, she decides to open a gym, borrows money from her parents and puts the rest on credit cards. I meanwhile have also started my business and am down from $120k income to $45k, I now owe $10k to the IRS and have $10k on my card, but things are picking up. She however owes about $50k in startup costs + has deferred her taxes for 60 days (hasn't even looked at them and refuses to do so until she is ""mentally ready"").



I am starting to feel resentful, for the last 3 years I have been getting up at 7:45, working my day job then working my side job until 1-2am, I have done this until I grew my business enough to support me before quitting my day job. Now I am still working 6 days a week but for myself. Yes I get tired and burnt out, but I just put my head down and power through. Whenever I tell her to just soldier through her stuff she thinks I am berating her. I try to set up meetings for her with my accountant but shes not ready yet or too embarrassed to say she doesn't know what shes got where.


It honestly feels like I am dealing with my 21 year old self who just put my head in the sand and hoped for it all to go away. Add to this that she has put on 40lbs in the last 2 years and complains about her weight but has no interest in trying to tackle it. 


She keeps saying she needs a vacation somewhere, is ordering clothes online with her credit card, but I am out of patience, I cannot keep supporting her financially or mentally, my own health is suffering, I want to be available for her, but if I keep hearing the same things over and over I will go insane or snap and walk out. Shes a wonderful, amazing person, when she was working out and doing yoga she looked gorgeous, could deadlift 225 and squat about the same, she seemed happy. Now its nachos on the sofa in a t shirt with holes in that she got from a high school boyfriend. 


Finally, she jokes that I should earn more money so she could be a kept woman, I know she is joking but I think its a half-truth. Also talks about marriage and getting her name added to the title of the house, but the way things are going I feel apprehensive to commit to either of those because of her behavior.

How do I resolve this? Where do I start if she won't even talk about money and her business? How do I get her eating better and working out more? How do I state that I don't want her name on the house or marriage if things don't change for the better.

**TLDR: Paying over 80% of household bills, all meals out etc. girlfriend has business that's not making money yet she keep spending. Shes put on 40lbs and stopped making any effort. I think she is depressed and any advice I give is taken as a personal attack and met with anger/defiance/tears.** 

Writing this felt super cathartic, but tomorrow is another day... thank you in advance for whatever your responses may be!!!

**EDIT: Holy crap, thank you everyone who responded! Reading through now with a coffee**
