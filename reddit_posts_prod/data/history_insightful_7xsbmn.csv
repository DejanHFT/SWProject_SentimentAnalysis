Hello, I’m Ben Raines. I’m a newspaper reporter by trade, so I kept my hunt for the Clotilda, the last American slave ship, secret. I thought people would think I was nuts if I said I was going to look for a ship that had been missing for 150 years. While we can’t say for certain yet that this is the Clotilda, we know that the wreck is from the right era, is the right size, lies roughly where the captain said he burned it in 1860, and the wreck appears to have been burnt.
 
In the end, finding it was mostly down to old fashioned sleuthing. I searched through old records, maps, interviews and newspaper articles, some 150 years old. One of my best resources was a handwritten journal kept by the captain of the Clotilda. I used our epic winter weather this year, including the Bomb Cyclone on the east coast, and the super low tides that resulted from stout north winds for my search window. With the tide so far out, it was if a blanket had been pulled back from the giant swamp where the ship was supposed to have been burned in 1860. There, lying in the mud near an island where the captain said he burned it, I found the wreck of a huge sailing vessel.
 
All of the members of this AMA panel are quoted [in my original story about the wreck, which you can read here](http://www.al.com/news/mobile/index.ssf/2018/01/alcom_reporter_may_have_found.html#incart_big-photo) (don’t forget to watch the video!).
 
On the panel with me are John Sledge, a historian specializing in the tale of the Clotilda and the port of Mobile, and author of the exhaustive history The Mobile River, and two archaeologists from the University of West Florida, Dr. John Bratten and Dr. Greg Cook. Together, they have previously dug up Spanish galleons sunk in 1559 and slave ships off the coast of Ghana. All three of them have visited the Clotilda and can provide amazing insights into the past and the techniques that will be used to investigate this ship. We can also talk about the incredible history of Africatown, the Alabama community started by the survivors of the Clotilda.
 
Ultimately, because of Africatown, the Clotilda is an even more powerful totem than just a slave ship. It is the last slave ship. What’s more, we know more about its voyage and the fate of the 110 souls imprisoned on board than is known about any of the millions of people brought in bondage to this country. We know exactly what part of Africa they came from, exactly when they arrived, who brought them here, and where they ended up after the Civil War. When the war ended just five years after their arrival, they were freed, but also homeless and destitute.  The discovery of the wreck is the final piece of the incredible story of Africatown, a community on the edge of the swamp north of Mobile formed by the Clotilda survivors in 1860 on land they bought from the plantation owner who enslaved them. Many of their descendants still live there today. It is the only community formed by native Africans in the United States. Even then, it was a place apart from both white and black Mobile. The Clotilda group spoke their native dialect, taught their children in their traditional way, and farmed using African methods.
 
Amazingly, their lives were forever interrupted to settle a $1,000 bet between a slave-owning steamboat captain and a group of northerners traveling on his riverboat. Join us for our AMA and ask us anything you can think of about this suddenly revealed piece of our past.
