For those who achieved substantial body changes: How did you push yourself day in and day out? I'm on day 4 of my own journey and it's getting tough.,anon120,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/zeqw7/for_those_who_achieved_substantial_body_changes/,104,24,"I'm on day 4 of Insanity and today's workout really hit me hard. I'm toning up my body for a wedding in late October and so far I've been really good with my workouts and food intake. Today, however, I quit 10 minutes before the set was over. I was out of energy.


I'm just curious as to what each of you think to get that little extra bit of energy to do what your body thinks it can't. I know working out is all mental and right now that's what seems to be failing with me.

I want nothing more than to reach my goal by the wedding and although the wedding itself is good motivation, it's simply not enough to get me to the next level of endurance.

Thanks!


TL;DR - Had trouble with my routine today. How do you regain your motivation to push through rough workouts and stay on top of your fitness goals?

**EDIT - Thank you to everyone that's posted on here! You never realize just how strong support from others can really be. Even if you came here betting I'd fail, it's such a motivation to just keep pushing, keep going so thank you thank you thank you <3**"
