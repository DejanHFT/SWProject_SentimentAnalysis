Being a better supportive spouse is impossible for me,kikamperine,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/kpdmhx/being_a_better_supportive_spouse_is_impossible/,5,3,"Brief background: together for 8 years, married for 7, have a 3yo kid together.

My husband (m46) has an annoying habit of letting his feelings or problems boil up inside him, dishing out what is bothering him without lots of details, then brushing it off as “no big deal” so that we don’t discuss it throughly. I (f34) try to ask for more info (especially when it involves both of us, or anything parenting related) but he keeps saying it’s fine, I don’t want to talk about it. Some times he will finally open up a couple days later, and it’s usually to unload the rest of his feelings or what has been stressing him.

Recently he said he doesn’t think i love him as strongly as he loves me; I had been in a depressive slump and he let me know he will do anything for me, encouraged me to take time for myself and do things for myself. (Being a FTM has been shitty lately, no duh, and I have some very hard times being alone.) I was not sure how to respond when he told me this, except to apologize for not being supportive enough. But I honestly don’t know what to do. His main love language is words of affirmation, and I always ask how he is doing, how he’s feeling, but that goes nowhere. I keep using my love language of acts of service to do things for him, but of course that doesn’t work as well.

I keep making the mistake of leaving him alone because he is in such a rotten mood, which is thrown back at me for “not doing enough”. If I try talking about what’s going on, he shuts down. I get close to be comforting, but he blows it off or doesn’t reciprocate. There is nothing I can do to move things along, open up, or be supportive for him. Even when I ask for specific things to do for him, this time or next, he has no answer except “be there for me”. What am I supposed to do?

TL;DR - husband bursts open with negative feelings during stressful times, then clams up, I try to continue conversation & get shut down, then am “not good enough” for doing the wrong things"
