Boyfriend (25 m) not supportive of my (22f) career choice,EuphoricDuchess,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/138tksw/boyfriend_25_m_not_supportive_of_my_22f_career/,377,1247,"I am in college to become a teacher and will be graduating soon. I am a secondary content teacher, which means I will be able to teach both middle and high school. My student-teaching placement was in a middle school in the Fall, and I have continued to substitute at the middle school.

Going into teaching, I always wanted to teach High School. But, I then got placed into middle school and loved it. I then would tell my boyfriend that I really liked middle school and that this is where I would like to teach. I enjoy it everyday. But, I also think it's a comfort. I really do like middle school because I did my student-teaching there and am comfortable with how the education system works. But, I never ruled out high school.

Now, fast forward to a couple months ago. I got a job interview (my first one) for a high school in an urban city. I want to live in this city, and after the interview, I was really confident that I would get the job.They offered it to me, and it’s one of the highest paying districts in my state. I was excited, and ideally decided that I would like to work there.

Now, ever since I got the job offer, my boyfriend has never been very supportive. He questioned why I was taking this job if I never wanted high school, why I didn’t interview other places (which I understand- it was my first interview and I did jump the gun). When the topic would come up, I would say I didn’t want to talk about it because he always tried to belittle me and question my motives. I never felt a sense of support for this. When I told him this, he said it’s because he knows me best and that he doesn’t agree with my decision because I “changed what grade I want to teach.” But, again, I haven’t even graduated yet!

We got into an argument last night. I sent him a picture of my school (first time seeing it in person) and he immediately started questioning my decision. He started sending screenshots of the school’s ranking (again, not the best as it's a public school in an urban district) but I tried to explain why it may be like that to him- poverty, lack of support, funding, etc. He didn’t want to listen, and then proceeded to call me a manipulator for the rest of the phone call because I changed my mind on what grade I wanted to teach. He then kept calling me toxic and said that I was manipulating him because I would say ""I understand why you think that **but**..."" He said that I changed my mind and that it’s disrespectful to him because I decided “at the last minute” and didn’t consult with him that I want to take this high school job instead of a middle school job. He also said that him talking to me at 4am about this shows that he does care because “a normal guy would just let it go and go to bed.”

It was late at night when we were talking, and then we kind of just left it and went to bed. I didn’t feel like talking about something like this that I feel he is irrational about. Then, he calls me 10 minutes later and says “I have a theory about what happened. You always wanted to teach high school. And then you met me and said that you wanted to do middle school. But it was always in the back of your mind that you were going to teach high school. Because you want to be the hot teacher with all the 17 and 18 year old guys walking around. That’s what it is right?”

After he said that I felt so disgusting and disrespected. I feel as if all along this is why he’s upset and hasn’t been supportive of my decision. It’s pathetic and gross, and I am just at a loss of words for how I should handle it. Once he said that on the phone I told him to stop talking and that I was going to bed. I haven’t talked to him since last night. I don't know how to even address this. Any advice on where to even go from here?

tl;dr : Boyfriend is not supportive and is accusing me of being manipulative because I took a job offer for a high school and not a middle school."
