In need of wellness and fitness posters and flyers,Sassersfreemantle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/lqixt/in_need_of_wellness_and_fitness_posters_and_flyers/,2,0,"I am an RA (resident advisor) for a university housing community that houses primarily freshmen students. The theme of my dorm is *wellness*; I have my focus on physical wellness, mental wellness, and healthy habits as a student.

I would like to put up posters and flyers around the hall that focus on exercise (e.g. stretches, etc.), motivation, time-management tips, and diet. 
Do you guys have any favourite posters or images that are informational/inspiring for any of these wellness focus areas?
