Worldly Cinema: Japan,ZamrosX,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3tp4f6/worldly_cinema_japan/,337,200,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we are doing Japan.
