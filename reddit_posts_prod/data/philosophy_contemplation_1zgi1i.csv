Some people might not see this immediately as philosophy, as it isn't exactly a live topic, but the nature of the Sublime was a big topic for 18th century English and German philosophers. I got the idea from this [David Rathbone lecture series on Hegel](http://criticalidealism.net.au/mscphegelcourse/hegelpage.html), including the example of someone being killed by a wave, and animals not sharing the feeling. It was a couple years ago that I listened to it, so I don't where exactly in the series it is. I highly recommended the series in general, as it makes Hegel fairly accessible (certainly more so than trying to read it), and even more importantly, David Rathborne has a highly pleasing Austrailia accent, so it's easy to listen to. I changed some of the reasoning from Hegel however, and it is much closer to [Schopenhauer](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer-aesthetics/#BeaSub). From SEP:

>The other class of contemplation-resistant “objects” or phenomena are those that bear a hostile relationship to the human will insofar as they are so vast or powerful that they threaten to overwhelm the human individual or reduce his existence on this planet to a mere speck. Schopenhauer gives as examples desert landscapes, cascades, and the starry night sky, among many others. Unlike the case of the stimulating, however, Schopenhauer does believe that aesthetic contemplation of these phenomena is possible, and when it transpires the experience is that of the sublime.

...

>Schopenhauer offers a phenomenologically-complex account of how we may take aesthetic pleasure in such fearsome or overwhelming scenes. In order to contemplate the Ideas in hostile objects aesthetically, the subject must first acknowledge the fearsomeness or the sheer vastness of the object, but then “consciously turn away” from the threat, “violently wrenching himself free from his will” (WWR I, 226). If the subject can do this, and achieves will-less contemplation of the Ideas which express themselves in these threatening things, then the subject experiences a “state of elevation”—this is the feeling of the sublime.

So for Schopenhauer the very highest form of the beautiful and sublime would be to be destroyed by a violent, malevolent force of nature, *and to not flee from it, but face it*, embracing your own nothingness, rising above your will, and at the last moment becoming one with nature."
