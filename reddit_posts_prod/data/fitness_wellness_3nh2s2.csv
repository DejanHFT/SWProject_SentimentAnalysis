AMA about owning a Nutrition & Supplement store as well as the industry as a whole!,DKites,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3nh2s2/ama_about_owning_a_nutrition_supplement_store_as/,121,141,"I own an Online and Retail Nutrition store based out of the GTA in Canada and will answer nearly any questions regarding how to start a store, competing with the major industry leaders, signing labels and brands, margins (gross not profit), how I beat out the large competitors on pricing or whatever other questions people may have. I will do my best to answer every question posted, and I am a pretty upfront up-front guy about how the supplement industry functions so I wont shy away from some of the hard hitting controversial questions as long as everyone keeps it respectable.

As per the subreddit rules, I will not be posting a link to my website, just here to answer questions. If you are dying to know my store you can always just send me a PM.

Cheers

EDIT: This is my one day a week I sorta take off from my businesses, and I have some personal obligations, however I will do my best to keep answering any questions posted since there is lots of interest. Just may have to get to them a bit later in the day is all. Thank you to everyone who asked some solid questions,

Dylan"
