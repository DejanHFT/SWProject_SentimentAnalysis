Writing inspiration from wasted potential in books/movies,Mundane-Cost4076,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/zkklyi/writing_inspiration_from_wasted_potential_in/,81,119,"
I’ve found a lot of my writing inspiration comes from watching a tv show or movie or reading a book and getting frustrated when it dissolves into major plot holes and gimmicky crap. 

Or when the story had AMAZING potential then suddenly nosedives into oblivion. I literally have to put down when i’m reading/watching and go make my own story. 

Maybe this is seen as a tantrum, like, “things didn’t go exactly as I wanted!” but it can make for good inspiration. Writing it about making whatever the hell you want. it’s fun and a good place to start. 

It makes you think, “let me try to do it better.” It helps you strive to improve and learn from others’ mistakes. 

It’s gotten me out of every writing slump i’ve had without fail. Has this ever been inspiration for you?



(And not plagiarizing. It’s more large scale (i.e. genres) or pieces of a story that you can take and run with)"
