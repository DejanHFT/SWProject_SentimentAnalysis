"What is the most beautiful song? To you, that is.",sexy_brontosaurus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1748s7o/what_is_the_most_beautiful_song_to_you_that_is/,2084,1003,"Tom Waits' song, ""Innocent When You Dream"" haunts me both when asleep and awake. Its melody sunk its talons in like no other, and the lyrics hit ever harder as I age. There's two versions of the song off of the album Frank's Wild Years, both equally perfect in their own right, and I often mix and match the vocal melodies when I sing it aloud. Despite hearing the song 20,000 times, it has never gotten old, or faded from my memory. No other song has such sentimental and emotional impact for me, that has held up through the test of time.

So my question is to you, dear redditors... what song has this effect for you? Not necessarily your FAVORITE song, but one which lives rent free in the mind and makes you contemplate and appreciate. A timeless song that regardless of what anyone else thinks or feels, means an immense amount to you.

Ready? .....Go!

EDIT: Hell yeah, y'all came through! Can't wait to dive in! If anyone makes a spotify playlist LMK cuz otherwise I likely will in a few days."
