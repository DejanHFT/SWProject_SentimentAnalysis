We are not here to help you with your End of Term papers.,creesch,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/brlgx5/we_are_not_here_to_help_you_with_your_end_of_term/,510,7268,"Hi everyone and especially our students,

We appreciate that the school year is coming to a close, and you've put that history paper off till the last minute. However, this is not the place to seek help with your homework, this is a place for discussions about history.

We are not here to:

 * Find you a topic
 * Fact check your paper
 * Research your paper
 * Write your paper
 * Do anything related to your homework

If you need help with your homework, please visit /r/HomeworkHelp. For clarity, we apply mods discretion here and will be slightly more strict than we'd usually might. If it looks like homework, smells like homework and sounds like homework it will likely be removed. 

Thanks everyone!"
