Would a norse mythology inspired story be considered original?,Megatron_36,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/15y7baw/would_a_norse_mythology_inspired_story_be/,20,0,"I’m working on a book inspired by norse mythology, the characters and their respective powers are kinda similar but the story is original, for one Loki doesn’t trigger Ragnarök (and of the world), somebody else does.

My friends told me it’s not original and I should write something original, but some others said that since my story is original and is not really faithful to the original lore, it is indeed an original. The ones who said it wasn’t suggested me to just rename everyone and everything, the story would still be their, the thing is Loki The God of Lies is incredibly crucial for it to work, and creating a new guy with similar abilities (I think) would really start to look like a rip off.

I’m confused AF, any advice would really help."
