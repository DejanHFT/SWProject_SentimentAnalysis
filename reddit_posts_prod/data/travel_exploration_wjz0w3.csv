Exploring Vegas on a Layover,grossartig_dude,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/wjz0w3/exploring_vegas_on_a_layover/,6,0,"I'm gonna make a layover in Vegas from 5 PM to 6 AM the next day, and I wanna explore about 12 locations (hotels and malls) down the strip. Do you think I'll have enough time for it? Also, what's the last safe time to be in the streets of Vegas? I mean, is it safe after midnight?"
