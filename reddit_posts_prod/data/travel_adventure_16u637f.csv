Waiting to book through G Adventures,Throwaway041897,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16u637f/waiting_to_book_through_g_adventures/,8,1,"Hi all!

So I’m looking at taking a trip in March during my spring break. I’ve noticed that G adventures is having a lot of sales for trips in the next 3-4 months, but then prices go up. 


I was wondering if these “short term” sales usually go on all year. I’m guessing it’s because they’re trying to sell the last tickets (meaning a lot of tours don’t sell out).

Should I wait to book until January or February if so? Specifically My trip is an African safari tour. Tanzania"
