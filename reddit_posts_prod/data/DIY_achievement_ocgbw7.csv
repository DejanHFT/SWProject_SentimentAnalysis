[Question] Thoughts on how to achieve weathered/etched look in concrete decor?,pchao89,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/ocgbw7/question_thoughts_on_how_to_achieve/,6,2,"I’ve been experimenting with creating concrete goods such as planter pots. The method I’ve used has been casting using a silicone mold.

Recently I discovered some weathered concrete vessels (basically a hallow container) from Restoration Hardware that l’d like to replicate (Google search “Etched Concrete Vessel Collection”).

I have an idea on how I might accomplish this, but would love to get some recommendations from the community. My method would be to apply a layer of concrete mix onto the pot, then adding texture before it dries completely (maybe using a concrete texture roller)."
