How long did It typically take the Romans to build a mile of road?,TheByzantineEmperor,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/63npzi/how_long_did_it_typically_take_the_romans_to/,19,21,"It has literally taken almost a year for a construction company to build 1/2 a mile of road that connects two roads near where I live. I think that's pretty ridiculous. My question is, how long did it take the Romans to build a mile of road? Could they have done 100 in the time it takes us 1?

Edit: Thank you all for the replies, it has been very insightful!"
