How to fix this terrible paint job,goozmodo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15z9907,2,1,"So I came home to visit the parents and discovered my father had taken it upon himself to “fix” some scratches to part of the frame of our living room glass coffee table.  He removed the top of the frame and repainted it a color that’s so off… I don’t have the heart to say anything and want to just try and redo things to avoid having to replace the table for the ‘rents (our mom is beyond upset at the moment)

 Any recommendations on how best to improve his “fix”?

I did some initial research and came across Amaco’s Rub n’ Buff line of metallic finishes, just wasn’t sure if that’s suitable.  I’m assuming I have to find a better match for the base first so I can then rub the finish in to give it an antique look?  Is spray paint the way to go or should I take this to someone to strip? 

Appreciate any tips on how to get this “fix” improved."
