"Nick Cave's reaction to ChatGPT writing “Nick Cave Style” lyrics, Arthur C Clark's “full unemployment future” and how tech innovations were dealt with throughout History",trubol,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10emca8/nick_caves_reaction_to_chatgpt_writing_nick_cave/,4,8,"Whenever I see people worried about their jobs in an AI future, it reminds me of this [TMAWL sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyu4u3VZYaQ), where they joke about jobs during the transition from Stone Age to Bronze Age.

&#x200B;

(TL;DW: The chipper is not happy about Bronze Age, as his job will be gone. The tier is fine, because his job will be safe.)

I read today about Nick Cave's reaction to ChatGPT writing “Nick Cave Style” lyrics here: [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/17/this-song-sucks-nick-cave-responds-to-chatgpt-song-written-in-style-of-nick-cave](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/17/this-song-sucks-nick-cave-responds-to-chatgpt-song-written-in-style-of-nick-cave)

Although this might sound simplistic, I would think throughout History the people who are against innovation (Luddites, etc) are usually the ones whose jobs would be most at risk.

What I think we should remember instead is what Arthur C Clarke apparently said in 1969: “The goal of the future is full unemployment, so we can play” 

&#x200B;

From [Quote Investigator](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/11/11/goal/): During the conversation Clarke and Youngblood mentioned the benefits humankind might be able to obtain from the development of advanced computer systems able to perform numerous tasks better and more quickly than people. Yet, the HAL 9000 computer in the movie “2001” was frightening, and Youngblood asked why a negative vision was highlighted.

&#x200B;

GENE: But you see the average person doesn’t see it. All he sees is that he’s going to be replaced by a computer, reduced to an IBM card and filed away.

&#x200B;

CLARKE: The goal of the future is full unemployment, so we can play. That’s why we have to destroy the present politico-economic system. 

&#x200B;

In a world where most Central Banks have full employment (or low unemployment) as a target, and where Max Weber's hypothetical Protestant Work Ethic ""work till you drop"" values are still highly regarded, we would have indeed to destroy the present system in order to adapt to an AI future.

&#x200B;

Maybe this is what Peter Thiel was afraid of when he [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=-iYpmOV60ks) “Crypto is decentralizing, AI is centralizing. Or, if you want to frame it more ideologically, crypto is libertarian and AI is communist""."
