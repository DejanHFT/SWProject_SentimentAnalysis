Best book to read to become more on general nutrition and wellness? So much bad information out there..,Zeds_dead,https://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/1aiohx/best_book_to_read_to_become_more_on_general/,3,7,"I loathe the gargantuan amount of profit driven propaganda out there used to convince people this is bad or that is good so people will spend money on what companies want.

I want to actually know some of what the scientific literature says and not the propaganda news and advertising have convinced most of the population. Any good books you could recommend on this subject?"
