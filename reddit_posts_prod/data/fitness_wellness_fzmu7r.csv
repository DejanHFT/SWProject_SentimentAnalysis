Stair well running,ArchibaldTheCrab,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/fzmu7r/stair_well_running/,7,3,"During the quarerntine period, I've been looking for ways to keep fit. Home workouts have been good but a recent post by Hugh Jackman made me realise the untapped potential of my apartment complex stair well. Thing is, I've never done stair runs or really used a stair machine. I can run 5-10km without an issue. What kind of targets should I be aiming for with stair runs? Googling it has just left me more confused."
