What do you find motivating?,toastledrums,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3fjx67/what_do_you_find_motivating/,113,40,"I am curious what people find motivating in achieving their goals - be it loosing weight/maintaining/gaining muscle?

I am referring at things like having gym buddy/ seeing before-after pictures of others/ discuss progress on reddit-forums/ counting calories , etc...; Was thinking we could share these things here and get inspiration from each other.

Currently I am in the process of loosing weight so counting calories and seeing results is what I find motivating. What about you? :)"
