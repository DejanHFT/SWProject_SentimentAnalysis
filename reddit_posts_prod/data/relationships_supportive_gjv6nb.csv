My (31M) ex (31F) contacted me for the first time in 9 days to borrow money. I lent it to her. She broke up with me a week and a bit ago because I wasnt supportive enough. How could I have been more supportive?,Pretend_Grade,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gjv6nb/my_31m_ex_31f_contacted_me_for_the_first_time_in/,12,0,"Yes. I know I am stupid. However, do bear in mind that I care about this woman a lot. I do care if she goes hungry, and she probably would have if I didn't lend it to her.

She was my girlfriend for a year, although I have known her for 5-years. I spent 3-months essentially living with her, but an issue with her mum meant she was getting evicted. Nothing I could do about this. Oh, and her mum (they were in an argument) also got the whole electrical system shut off to my girlfriend's place. Again, nothing I could do about this. Neither of these issues could be solved by money.

For the next month, I worked non-stop to try and ensure she could eat. Her income had completely stopped, so I had to cover her income too. This meant doing double the amount of work I normally do (due to Corona, freelance work is harder to come by). 

At the end of the month, when she finally got money again, she asked me to leave. She said she would help me with food the following month, because I had helped her the previous month. She didn't, but that is fine. She paid for my train ticket and I left. She insisted it wasn't her breaking up with me, but she just needed time to process the eviction and finding somewhere to live.

For the next week, she ignored me. After a week, she sent a text saying she broke up with me (just one line) and ignored me for 2 more days before she called. She said apparently I didn't provide enough support during the previous month for her. I mean, I paid for all her bills and food. I even tried to help her find new places to live. Of course, this wasn't enough support.

She also said she missed our fun chats that disappeared over the course of a month. Well, yeah. They did disappear because I had to work almost constantly away from her (sometimes as much as 16-hours per day). I don't know how I could have changed this. It was an unprecedented situation.

She said she no longer loves me. This was after me leaving and saying ""I love you so much, I want to marry you"". But, I guess me not being there for a week made her rethink that whole thing.

She then didn't speak to me for a week. Although, she has all my stuff at her place. She said I couldn't collect it right now and she was too stressed with the move.

Today, 9 days after we last spoke (and believe me, I have been trying hard not to speak), she messaged and asked if she could borrow money for food. I said yes because:  


1. She will always pay it back
2. She is hungry, and I care about her a LOT.

I know it was damn stupid, but I can't let her starve. She literally has nobody else to turn to. No friends, and her mum has completely shut her out of her life. I literally emptied one of my bank accounts to help her. I won't be eating now for a few days, but still.

When I sent it, she just went offline. No thank you or anything. Just...gone. Although, to be fair, she did say she was going to switch her phone off.

I still don't know how I wasn't supportive the past month, though. What more could I have done? I simply do not see it. I worked. I helped to feed her. I paid her bills. I started helping her find a place to live.

TL;DR: I gave my ex money to help feed her. Was this a bad thing? How could I have possibly supported her more during a rather testing month?"
