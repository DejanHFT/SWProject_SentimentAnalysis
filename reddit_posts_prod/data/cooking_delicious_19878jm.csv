I have some venison backloin. Is there any way I can cook and make this delicious in a crock pot?,uhg2bkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/19878jm/i_have_some_venison_backloin_is_there_any_way_i/,2,1,"I make a mean pot roast with carrots, celery, onions, cream of mushroom soup, and Lipton beefy onion mix. I don’t know if I could use these same ingredients with venison. Will I ruin the venison if I attempt to cook it in the crock pot since it’s so lean? Any advice / commentary appreciated!"
