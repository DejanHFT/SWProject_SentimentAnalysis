EBC - Intrepid or G Adventures?,youngwolves2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17f6bg1/ebc_intrepid_or_g_adventures/,3,1,"Hi, 

I’m 27m and looking to do Everest Base Camp next year. I’ll most likely be going solo but I’d like to find a group to do it with for safety reasons and to make some new friends along the way. 

I have been looking at the Intrepid and G Adventure tours and can’t really decide on which one to go for. Has anyone here done a trip to Nepal with either group and which one would you recommend?

I’m young and would rather be around people more in my age bracket ideally if that changes anything. 

Also feel free to reach out if you’re looking at doing EBC next year and are in the same predicament. 

Thanks!"
