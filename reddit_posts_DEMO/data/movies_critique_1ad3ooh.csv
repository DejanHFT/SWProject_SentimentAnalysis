"Hot Take: I Think Barbie is (Intentionally?) a Critique of Rich ""Girlboss"" Feminism",ChuckDanger-PI,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ad3ooh/hot_take_i_think_barbie_is_intentionally_a/,878,2731,"A bit late to the discussion, but only just saw Barbie, and I feel like one message of the movie is a critique of rich (white?) feminism and the need for intersectionality.  As I understand the movie:

1. Barbie world is meant to be a mirror image of the real world.  So whereas women are oppressed by the patriarchy in the real world, Kens are oppressed by the matriarchy in Barbie world (or, if not oppressed, second class citizens).
2. America Ferrara's character, Gloria, has at least some control/impact on Barbie world.  It is her negative thoughts that introduce the fear of mortality into stereotypical Barbie, and I believe she notes that Weird Barbie looks the way she does because Gloria did things to the doll in real life.  It may even be that all of Barbie world is an extension of her psyche and that there are in fact multiple Barbie worlds, each created by a real world girl's imagination (it was unclear to me what the case may be).  But regardless, it would appear that Gloria is at least complicit, if not an active participant, in Ken's oppression in Barbie World.
3. In the real world, Gloria's daughter is in private school (she wears a school uniform), she lives in a multi-million dollar home in Los Angeles, drives a brand new car with all the options, and works on the top floor of a large multinational company as some sort of executive assistant (so not a nothing job), but can only see herself as oppressed because she is not actually in the boardroom (which is true! That is oppression!).
4. There is no discussion of class in the movie (all the Barbies are fabulously wealthy), and while the Barbies are diverse, race is also not mentioned.  In the movie, all oppression is viewed solely thru the lens of patriarchy and feminism, not intersectionally.
5. At no point does Gloria show any awareness of her own role as an oppressor, whether in the real world or of Ken(s) in Barbie world.  In fact, when Ken rebels against the oppression that Gloria was at the very least complicit in, she works against him to restore the status quo.  And while Gloria apologizes to Weird Barbie for making her look weird (I could be misremembering this), she never apologizes to Ken for her actions towards him.

I don't know, I'm not sure Gerwig intended it, but it seems to me that this is a bit of a parody of the strain of girlboss feminism that thinks an oppressive society can be dismantled simply by making more women CEOs.

Or I could have just been way too high when I watched (the colors were pretty though).

EDIT: I rewatched a couple of scenes, and I was wrong about the private school.  The daughter and friends are just wearing very, very similar outfits, but the students in the background are not in uniforms.  So I may have overstated things a bit.  Still think Gloria is wealthy in a professional class kind of way.  Also, the relationship between Gloria and Weird Barbie is unclear.  Gloria says ""I had a Weird Barbie! It happens when you play too much with them!"" and Weird Barbie says ""It's okay"" and kind of winks.  I took it to mean this was Gloria's Weird Barbie, but it is ambiguous."
