"I am Gideon Nisbet, Classics professor and editor of Martial’s infamous (and filthy) Epigrams for Oxford World’s Classics. Ask me anything.",OUPacademic,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/41uff1/i_am_gideon_nisbet_classics_professor_and_editor/,65,210,"I’m a professor, researcher, and translator in the classical world at the University of Birmingham. For the last three months, I’ve been involved with the #OWCReads online reading group on @OWC_Oxford, providing insight into Martial’s foul-mouthed—but unforgettable—collection.  
 
You can find my edition of Martial’s Epigrams here: https://global.oup.com/academic/product/epigrams-9780199645459

Ask me anything about “Epigrams,” Ancient Rome, etc.

EDIT: I've got to head away from work now, but will check in later in case you have more questions.

EDIT: Thanks so much to everyone who participated! "
