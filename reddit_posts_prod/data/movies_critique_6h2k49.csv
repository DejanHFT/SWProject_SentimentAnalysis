Suggestion: Let's start some threads analyzing and critiquing movie critics and their reviews,fatstinkypoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6h2k49/suggestion_lets_start_some_threads_analyzing_and/,36,0,"I'm not sure of the best way to handle this.  Most people including me don't know movie critics by name, so I guess the best way to do it would be to pick a movie and then analyze critics' reviews together and pick out things that a critic says that conflict with what you feel (i.e., things that make you say ""WTF?!"").  For example, let's take ""Get Out"".  Sources we can use (or just link to any online video or website review you want to analyze):

* [RT's *selected* reviews](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/get_out/reviews/)
* [IMDB's *selected* reviews](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/criticreviews?ref_=tt_ql_op_6)
* [IMDB's external reviews](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/externalreviews?ref_=tt_ql_op_5)

I don't see why critics shouldn't be held accountable for what they say.  Who knows if they've even seen the movie since most just seem to parrot every other critic.  Why should they have immunity from criticism?  "
