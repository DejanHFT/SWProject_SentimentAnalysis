Best way to add outlet in garage without cutting drywall?,Ivy93,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/18sxtqh/best_way_to_add_outlet_in_garage_without_cutting/,2,0,"In my garage I have (1) light switch and (1) electric outlet.  I'd like to leverage that existing wiring to add another outlet to the other side of my garage.  

Ideally I'd like to run Romex along the drywall exterior to the other side and then feed that into an outlet.  Given my existing outlet is a new work box, what modification or recommendation do you have to achieve this?"
