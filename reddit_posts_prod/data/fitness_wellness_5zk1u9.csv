Does anyone use a desk bike/treadmill that actually works well?,jarretman,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5zk1u9/does_anyone_use_a_desk_biketreadmill_that/,15,20,I spend a lot of time at my computer for both work and home. I have looked into some sort of desk cardio device but they all look shitty and have terrible reviews. Anyone have luck with this?
