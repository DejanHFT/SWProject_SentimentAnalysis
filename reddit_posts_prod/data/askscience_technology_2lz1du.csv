Is it possible to build a van sized vehicle propelled by an electric motor powered by rooftop solar panels given present-day technology?,DanHam117,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2lz1du/is_it_possible_to_build_a_van_sized_vehicle/,277,695,"It's a pipe dream but I've always wanted the ability to just get in a car and roadtrip to, for example, the Grand Canyon and not have to worry about paying for gas or a hotel room. I'm just looking for any possible way that I can have a vehicle large enough to fit a mattress in the back that I can drive around in powered only by the sun. If I have to stop and let the thing charge every hour, fine, I can deal with that. Is there enough power generated by present-day solar panels that I could pull this off and get to minimum highway speeds?"
