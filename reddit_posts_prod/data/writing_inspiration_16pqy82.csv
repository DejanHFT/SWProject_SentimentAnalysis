The Creative Act: A Way of Being by Rick Rubin (Creative Inspiration & Motivation),BlindAmbition2023,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/16pqy82/the_creative_act_a_way_of_being_by_rick_rubin/,0,1,"Are you a creative person trying to find a great book to sink your teeth into? Welp look no further than “The Creative Act” by Rick Rubin.  
  
This book is easily my favorite book focused on creativity. Rick lays out the process from start to finish in an exceptionally in depth and beautiful way. From the concept of gathering seeds, to growing the tree and pruning it; the way Rick describes the creative process is accessible to all artists, at all skill levels, from any genre.  
  
One key takeaway I got from this book was how all artists have our own struggles. Some of the greatest performers on earth struggle with stage fright, some of the best writers of all time struggle with self-doubt, and almost all artists struggle with impostor syndrome. Before reading this book, I thought I was alone in my battle against these annoying internal conflicts, but I’m not and neither are you.  
  
The book doesn’t just offer endless creative insights, it also has some brilliant wisdom about life and how to influence your reality. I recommend this book to anyone that loves to create or if you’re thinking of dipping your toe into the creativity pool. Rick is a creative genius that all of us can learn from. This is a book I will go back to many times in my life for many reasons.  
  
If you’ve read the book, please let me know what you learned from Rick’s unique perspectives.
