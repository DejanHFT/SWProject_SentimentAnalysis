As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** 

>	This outrageously enjoyable spectacle has compelled my awestruck assent with its sheer stamina, scale and brio.

-[Peter Bradshaw, Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/05/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-one-review-tom-cruise)

>	The film is a mirror image of its star â€“ a muscular, extravagant, thoroughly old-school work of ingenuity and craft.
