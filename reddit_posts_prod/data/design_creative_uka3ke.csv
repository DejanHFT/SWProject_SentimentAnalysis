I have taken some college level art classes but no degree in an artistic field. I have designed logos, and business cards, company shirts, etc. I also do commissioned digital portraits and have an Instagram account dedicated to floral arrangements. I want to be known as a general creative that can help with any creative endeavor. I would like my title to sound professional. Thoughts?"
