Of course, the stonewalling continued and so did the ig story watching, so I made a close friends list with just him and my sister and posted the [attached note](https://imgur.com/a/pluBeFd) to my stories. I blocked him as soon as I saw that he had viewed it. 

This person did not have the capacity to reciprocate my love or probably just chose not to. I felt like I had being hanging on for hopes of what could be or at least some kind of closure. I started to doubt everything:
-the disappearing acts
-the stories and excuses
-progressively dwindling effort
-no pictures from the funerals
-never met any friends or family
-turning off read reciepts
-deleting his social media and changing his username multiple times
Hindsight is indeed 20/20.

I finally found that closure by giving it to myself. It really sucks, but at least I still have myself. It could have been worse, I could have wasted even more of my days pinning for him. I'm glad he never met my kids. 

TL;DR: I finally freed myself and did it on Instagram Stories!"
