What's your current/short-term reason for getting fit?,tporridge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4tkryf/whats_your_currentshortterm_reason_for_getting_fit/,2714,1953,"For example mine is: I'm going to see my little cousins soon and I refuse to give up carrying, and throwing them and giving piggy-back rides just because they've grown so much and aren't toddlers anymore. 

Whereas long term is obvs looking and feeling good.  

UPDATE (for the 0 people that care haha):
Handled giant little cousins ok + whole family noticed gains: grandma didn't say I 'look too skinny, have to eat more' so mini goals achieved. 

Recently got Tinder, need to look good naked, also will give this whole cardio thing a go...
