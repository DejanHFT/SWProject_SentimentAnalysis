NASA's Perseverance battery technology (mini nuclear reactor) said to last up to 14 years. Could same technology be used in electric vehicles?,Honestless,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/mi1sra/nasas_perseverance_battery_technology_mini/,163,765,"Hello, sorry if it's a stupid question but I'm really curious. I saw some article about how Perseverance is powered and it's really interesting. I understand that a car might require a bigger reactor but still, would it be possible to have it charge the vehicle's batteries as you go? 
If it would be possible, would it actually be a better option that having to charge every few hundred miles?"
