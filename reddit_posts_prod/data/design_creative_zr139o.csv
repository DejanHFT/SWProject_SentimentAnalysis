Any interest in Creative Director AMAs on this sub?,smrvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/zr139o/any_interest_in_creative_director_amas_on_this_sub/,5,26,"Hey there! I'm a mid-career creative director at a large, global PR/Strategic Comms company (and was previously the CD at a national magazine here in the US). I was wondering if it would be of interest to folks on this sub for CDs like me and others further along in our careers to do AMAs, to help offer advice and resources and/or learn from others who might chime in.

If that sounds interesting (and it's okay with the mods) then I'd be happy to start one up in the next few days and we could see how it goes!"
