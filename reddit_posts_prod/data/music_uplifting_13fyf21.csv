Music for the chronically depressed?,janee-lane,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/13fyf21/music_for_the_chronically_depressed/,103,12,Long story short I used to be big into music but since becoming depressed I hardly listen to anything. Mostly Sufjan Stevens and Interpol. Does anyone have any recommendations for the chronically depressed? It doesn't have to be uplifting but it doesn't need to be the saddest song you've ever heard either
