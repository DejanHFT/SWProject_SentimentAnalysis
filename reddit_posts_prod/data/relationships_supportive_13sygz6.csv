"What are some kind, outside the box ways I [37M] can thank my wife [33F] for being so incredibly sweet and supportive?",wannaMakeHerHappy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13sygz6/what_are_some_kind_outside_the_box_ways_i_37m_can/,13,7,"I've recently been feeling very bad and have had issues at work, and my wife has been (as she always is :)) the bright spot in my day, I can feel her love and support so deeply and I know I can never truly repay that except by giving it to her in return, but that doesn't stop me from wanting to spoil her a bit too. She and I have been together 15 years and married for 12. 

I really want to thank her for everything she's done for me recently, so I want to do a lot of nice things for her (I have some things in mind - a few little gifts picked out, a nice day and a nice evening planned, just a bunch of things she enjoys), but one thing she absolutely adores is being surprised (which she will be by this in general, but I'd like to surprise her with something unique too). What sort of (preferably cheap or free - she'd love anything that took blood, sweat, and tears rather than cold, hard cash) sweet gifts would be fitting to give to her as a ""thank you, I love you, here's something as special and unique as you""? Thank you in advance to all who help. 

Tl;dr - My wife is amazing and I want her to know it, anyone have a bonus odd/unique idea for a gift?"
