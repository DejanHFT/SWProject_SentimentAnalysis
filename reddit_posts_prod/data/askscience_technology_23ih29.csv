If space based telescopes cant see planets how will the earth based European Extremely Large Telescope do it?,greiton,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/23ih29/if_space_based_telescopes_cant_see_planets_how/,322,2225,I thought hubble was orders of magnitude better because our atmosphere gets in the way when looking at those kinds of resolutions. Would the same technology work much better in space?
