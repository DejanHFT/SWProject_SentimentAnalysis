I ate a roasted bone and it was delicious. How do I replicate this?,stupidrobots,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/9a43ru/i_ate_a_roasted_bone_and_it_was_delicious_how_do/,76,196,"I was at a restaurant this week and I got a blackened pork tomahawk chop with a long length of bone attached. I went to eat a piece of meat stuck to the end and bit clean through the bone. It was lightly charred but I bit clean through it and it had the texture of a hard crouton. 

And it tasted AMAZING

only about two inches of the end of the bone were like this but I would love to be able to make this on purpose at home. Can anyone provide a method to making crunchy roasted bones?

Edit

A lot of people here seem to think I am too stupid to know what is and is not a bone. Trust me, it was a bone. The bone was thin and the flavor was coming from all the marrow inside but I assure you all it was a bone. "
