MBA for restaurant entrepreneurship?,hhollowed235,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/36k0f2/mba_for_restaurant_entrepreneurship/,2,1,Would this be a good idea later down the line? 23 years old and I'm in the process of earning my associates in culinary arts and previously got my ba in psychology(before I thought I wanted to be a chef). Would an mba help me achieve my goals? Is there a better route to save time and money? Would it be just as effective to just read up and try to just get as much experience as possible in the industry?
