The saddest song you've ever heard...,BipolarUnipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/tfyipu/the_saddest_song_youve_ever_heard/,209,36,"I am in the mood for some melancholy beauty.  What is the saddest song you've ever heard.  For me it's a tie between Bonnie Raitt's [I can't make you love me](https://youtu.be/nW9Cu6GYqxo) and John Fullbright's [High Road](https://youtu.be/1WpVzC7yPGE).  Interestingly, Fullbright lost his grammy nomination to Bonnie Raitt.  Okay, folks.  Let me hear 'em."
