Looking for more 'modern day' strategy games. Any suggestions?,4uzzyDunlop,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/13ekqmb/looking_for_more_modern_day_strategy_games_any/,12,6,"I've been reading a lot about 'modern' geopolitical conflicts recently (think from the cold war to present day). 

I wanna play a strategy game focused on this time period, but haven't been able to find too much. I've got Civ 5 & HOI4 but they aren't really scratching the itch. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated! 

Thanks"
