Astronomy while blind,GreatAttractorPrey,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/jkr2a1/astronomy_while_blind/,32,70,"Hey guys! I just recently became really infatuated with astronomy and after several weeks of continued research I would love to pursue a degree in astronomy. I am legally blind and was wondering if anyone knew if I would be able to do so? If you don’t think I could would you recommend other degrees closely related that seem more doable? TIA
I’m missing my left eye and my right eye is 200/20 (legally blind). I also have a cataract and astigmatism. It’s been a struggle trying to find something I’m passionate about but still able to do with low vision. Unfortunately, everything else I’ve been interested in I legally can’t do and I’m hoping with astronomy that won’t be the case!
Edit: I forgot to mention the layers of my eye are also blended together
Edit: My knowledge on astronomy is far from vast yet that’s why I’m seeking help. I was mostly curious about what a day to day is like for an astronomer. Thank you all so much for your help!"
