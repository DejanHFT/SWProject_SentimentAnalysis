Is unmanned interstellar exploration theoretically possible with current technology?,hvusslax,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/scami/is_unmanned_interstellar_exploration/,16,4,"I wonder if we could see an unmanned interstellar probe make the journey to another star system and transmit data back to earth within the next 50 years or so. What are the largest obstacles of such a project?

Three specific issues come to mind:

* Do we have plausible propulsion methods to achieve the speed needed to be able to finish the journey in a matter of decades?
* Is radio communication over distances of light years even possible or would it be impossible to detect a signal from an man made probe from the background noise?
* The probe would have to be pretty smart to operate completely autonomously in a distant star system that we know little about. Is this problem solvable with our current AI technology?"
