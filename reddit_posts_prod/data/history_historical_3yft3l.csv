As best I can tell we found two sets of stuff. The first was from my Mom's great uncle J. Hilliard. I guess he served in the U.S. Military during the late 1800's early 1900.
The second set of stuff was from her Uncle Raymond Hilliard who served in an artillery battalion during WWII. There's a whole bunch of cool documents including his overseas diary. There are also a TON of photo's. There looks like two sets. One looks newer and has clean white boarders. The other is a bit older had has lots of war pictures including some with dead bodies. This set has irregular boarders.
There are also a bunch of stamps that was with the stuff but I don't believe is associated with it.
I'm hoping to get an idea of everything historical (or monetary) value. If there is some, I'd like to get it to the right place. Thanks!"
