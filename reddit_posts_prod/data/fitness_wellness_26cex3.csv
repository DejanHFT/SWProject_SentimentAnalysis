Stronglift not going well,dnaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/26cex3/stronglift_not_going_well/,25,2,"How many times have you guys deloaded?  I'm failing miserably lately.

I switched to 3x5 last month (from 5x5) because the 5x5 volume was really putting stress on my recovering knee.  This past week, I failed my 300 lb squat 3 days in a row.  Weird thing is 295 lb was difficult, but I was able to get 5/5/5 with some trouble, but I got it.  With 300 though, I'm getting 4/2/1, 3/1/0, 1/1/1.  I'm just getting worse and worse.

HISTORY:  I started on SL5x5 couple months ago.  I had a couple failures here and there, but nothing too major, e.g. fail a 200 lb squat 2 days in a row, but I knew I was just having a bad week, etc.  But with 300 lb squat, I go to the gym feeling GREAT, but start failing progressively worse.

Along with my squats, my DL and OHP are destroying me too.  I had a 315 DL (max), 5x5 was at 275 back in January, but I stopped deadlifting for the past 5 months (because of the knee thing, DLs were hurting my knee, Squats weren't, so I decided to take some time off DLs).  My DL is now at 250 3x5.  My OHP is doing just as poorly.  I hit 155 OHP for 5/4/5 the first attempt, 4/4/3 the 2nd attempt, and 4/4/3 the 3rd attempt.

Some advice?  The plan is of course just stick to the program.  Fail 3x and then deload 10-15%.  I'm going back down to 275 squat on my next workout and working back up from there.  But it just seems a bit weird that I got through 295 fine, but 300 was a miserable failure (couldn't even get CLOSE to 3x5).  And OHP was 5/4/5 1st attempt, so close, but I'm doing progressively worse.

Any advice?"
