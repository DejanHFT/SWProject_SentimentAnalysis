Painting / Coloring Copper Earrings,Beregolas,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/18grseo/painting_coloring_copper_earrings/,2,2,"Good evening folks,

So I'm working on a Christmas present for my partner and I am unsure how to proceed. I bought some cute copper earrings (that she will like) with 7 little ""feathers"" hanging below it's main body. (see attached picture) My plan when buying this on Sunday was to paint / color them in different rainbow colors (red, yellow, green, blue, violet probably). It's probably not the best quality, but I have a rather tight budget these days.

I bought them not really worrying about it, because I'm normally pretty crafty when it comes to wood and I thought ""I'll manage"", but now that I want to start I... just don't know where to start. I know next to nothing about metal and color and don't even really know what to ask.

A friend suggested a white undercoat and then going over it with ""normal"" paint, for example like the one used to tabletop figures. Another suggested enamel, but I wouldn't know where to start with that.

Any help would be appreciated, even just pointing me in the correct direction or telling me ways to achieve this.

Thanks in advance
