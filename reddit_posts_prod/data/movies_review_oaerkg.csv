Written Reviews:

[Empire - Nick De Semlyen - 4/5](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/black-widow-3/)

>It shouldn’t really have taken 11 years for the Widow to get her own standalone adventure. But thanks to some zesty new character dynamics and smart twists, Marvel have finally done her right.

[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/scarlett-johansson-in-marvels-black-widow-1234975052/)

>Directed by Cate Shortland with propulsive excitement, humor and pleasingly understated emotional interludes, this standalone proves a stellar vehicle for Scarlett Johansson’s Natasha Romanoff, given first-rate support by Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz and David Harbour.

[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw - 4/5](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jun/29/black-widow-review-scarlett-johansson-the-russian-super-spy-with-an-electra-complex)

>Great fun is had in giving us the backstory to the assassin’s place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe

[Vanity Fair - Richard Lawson](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/06/black-widow-movie-review-scarlett-johansson)

>The long-awaited standalone film about Scarlett Johansson’s ex-assassin is just that—an adventure that (mostly) operates outside of the larger franchise machinery.

[Variety - Owen Gleiberman](https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/black-widow-review-scarlett-johansson-florence-pugh-1235007198/)

>In her first stand-alone saga, Scarlett Johansson invests the famous fighter with an interior power.

[The Wrap - Alonso Duralde](https://www.thewrap.com/black-widow-film-review-scarlett-johansson-florence-pugh-mcu-2021/)

>Rather than deeply explore the character and soul of Natasha Romanoff, however, “Black Widow” treats her like a TV star who’s devoting an episode of her series to introducing new characters who might or might not break off into a spinoff of their own. The film does offer additional insight into the character’s tortured past, but the overwhelming effect is that of a baton being passed.

[Geek of Colour - Britany Murphy - 8/10](https://geeksofcolor.co/2021/06/29/black-widow-review/)

>Black Widow is a thoroughly entertaining flick that is likely to please audiences with its action, wittiness, and great characters. It is very much a spy thriller and different from the other movies we’ve received from the MCU thus far. As a standalone prequel, it does its job and serves as both a great ode and goodbye to the one and only, Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow.

[Forbes - Scott Mendelson](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2021/06/29/black-widow-review-too-little-too-late-for-scarlett-johansson-florence-pugh-and-marvel/?sh=4149533a537a)

>The years-too-late solo flick for Scarlett Johansson’s MCU superhero is both too much of a glorified backdoor pilot for its co-star and not up to par with the spy films and espionage thrillers it wishes to emulate.

[BBC - Caryn James - 4/5](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210629-film-review-four-stars-for-exciting-black-widow)

>The latest Marvel offering is entertaining and full of action. It is also 'the least Avenger-like movie in the series so far'

[New York Post - Johnny Oleksinski - 3/4](https://nypost.com/2021/06/29/black-widow-review-marvel-returns-in-thrilling-007-like-adventure/)

>The movie's vibe isn't like your average MCU entry at all, really. What it reminded me of are the many James Bond films where 007 goes rogue and cavorts around world cities seeking his revenge du jour.

[Time Out - Philip De Semiyen - 4/5](https://www.timeout.com/movies/black-widow-2021)

>The MCU goes Jason Bourne in a superhero spy movie that sparks when Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh share the screen. A satisfying mix of muscle and emotion.

[Washington Post - Ann Hornaday - 2.5/4](https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/black-widow-movie-review/2021/06/29/149eb7a6-d81f-11eb-9bbb-37c30dcf9363_story.html)

>Black Widow simultaneously feels like too much and too little."
