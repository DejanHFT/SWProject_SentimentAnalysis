Germany and other European Adventures,silverlining85,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/129xrac/germany_and_other_european_adventures/,6,1,"My sister will be going to Frankfurt, Germany for a week for work in June and then taking an extra week of vacation to explore. I plan to meet her there for that time. We’ve both never been to Europe but obviously want to make the most of our time there. We’re hoping to do a couple days in the Frankfurt area then want to explore elsewhere (Prague? France? Austria? Not sure yet!). I’d love tips, suggestions, etc for us—-we’re in our mid 30s and both love hiking, wine, flowers, beaches—we’re not really into heavy drinking or clubs. I’d love any recs!"
