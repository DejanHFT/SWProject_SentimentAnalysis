**Chapters 1 & 2 - enter the virtues**

We are what we do. This is one of Aristotle's great insights in this work. Who we are is directly equivalent to the behaviours we manifest, the actions we choose, the habits with which we fill our day-to-day. Here, we consider a quote from the Marx brothers: „My brother acts like an idiot and talks like an idiot but don't let that fool you. He truly is an idiot.“ It is exactly in the actions of a person that we can locate who they are.

This knowledge, however, Aristotle provides to us not so we can pronounce judgements on others from our lofty internet thrones but in order for us to engage in deep introspection. Through gaining greater awareness of how we act and are in the world, we can learn where and how to position ourselves to our best possible advantage. In other words, the philosopher guides us to learn to desire and strive for the behaviours, actions and habits which will yield the best outcomes for ourselves and our community. These behaviours, actions and habits he calls the virtues.

Now, Aristotle distinguishes between two types of virture. On one hand, we have the (i) intellectual virtues. These are different kinds of reasoning and knowledge that we can develop. To illustrate, it is one thing to know how to ride a bike, another to know how to build one from scratch and yet another to know the physics behind the way bicycles work. On the other hand, we have (ii) the virtues of character. These are habits, behaviours, actions which Aristotle discerns as the backbone of a prosperous and flourishing community. The intellectual virtues go hand-in-hand with the virtues of character. We practice the former to cultivate the mind and the latter to attune the body with the mind.

In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle deals extensively with virtues and sets forth how they lead to prosperity. In light of what in our contemporary day-to-day experience, however, should we understand Aristotle's thought? In his book „to Have or to Be“, the psychoanalyst Erich Fromm observes that if we took the sum of all product advertisements and put them together, we would effectively form an educational corpus of material which trains us to think of prosperity and happiness in terms of possession and ownership. Through continuous exposure to media advertising, we learn to (1) mistake complex socioeconomic problems for our personal individual problems and (2) think that we can solve each of these problems by purchasing particular products and services. Fromm calls this worldview the „having mode of existence“. He contrasts it with the „being mode of existence“ which he finds articulated in religions and thinkers across human history. This is where we locate Aristotle. In the being mode of existence, we invest our life energy and find prosperity and success not in collecting things but in developing our self and becoming more active, competent and competitive in our community and the world.

How do you orient yourself in the world? Where do you think you will find prosperity and happiness? What is the best possible way in which you can be? We offer the Nicomachean Ethics reading group not so you can just accept the answers Aristotle gives but in order for Aristotle to give you the language which will enable you to contemplate and discuss these questions in the first place.

**Chapter 3 - on childhood**

New leaves grow and old leaves drop. One flower wilts away while another prepares to bloom. Time is a river and as we float with its current the world unfurls upon us in the form of sights, smells and sounds, tastes and touches. It is through our senses that we receive information about the environment in which we find ourselves and it is this input we use to integrate ourselves in our environment.

Childhood stands as that one part in our lives in which we are the most curious. As children we seek out to capture the world with our senses. In running across mud and grass we find joy. Stepping on a jugged stone brings pain so we learn to avoid them. As we sit around a fire and watch it burn, we find warmth and wonder. We know to keep a safe distance though, if we felt the sting of its flaming tongues.

Aristotle puts forward that a child experiences the world as a landscape of pleasures and pains. During this period of development the philosopher situates primary caregivers as tasked with (i) helping children acquire a taste for activities which empower them and bring them forward and (ii) disincentivising behaviours and habits which disadvantage them.

With that being said, Plato makes it explicit in “the Republic” that parent and politician are birds of the same feather: in most things incompetent and most of the time self-serving. In old myths and fairy tales we find witch mothers who mutilate and blind their children until they become obedient slaves. We find ogre fathers who tell their children that they are “pure blooded and special”, that the world outside is “dirty, dangerous and evil”. With a smile in their face, they tell their children “it‘s for your own good” and proceed to lock them in a cage. So, let us shed the unhealthy world views foisted on us in the past and let us engage with the world as children once more. This time we will make a habit and learn to overcome obstacles and grow. We will find pleasure in becoming more.

Eudaimonia, that magical place in ourselves, we will know we have reached when, as Aristotle suggests, we no longer do things half-heartedly to please someone else but live our life with the fullest intensity we can muster, for our sake and that of the whole world.

**Chapter 4 - Good fruit comes from healthy trees**

Healthy apple trees produce good apples and diseased apple trees carry apples that share in the disease. We know to eat good apples and avoid the ones which show marks of disease. When a stranger offers us something or asks for our help as we walk a busy street, we experience hesitation. “What does this person really want?” Strangers appear before us as trees of unknown health condition and their actions are a fruit which might be poisonous to us.

There is always something more to an act than the act itself. Our actions do not exist in isolation. They are our way to connect with the world and the fruit of our view of the world, i.e. the mindset that we have cultivated within ourselves. In this chapter, Aristotle tells us that an action is not good in itself but only good if it proceeds from a well-cultivated and healthy mindset inclined to good intentions. Just as we will find no healthy apples on a sick tree, there are no recipes or step-by step guides to produce a virtuous action from a rotten mindset, a diseased view of the world. The only way to produce good fruit is to treat the tree itself back to health.

**Chapter 5 - Locating the virtues**

Aristotle now moves to locate the virtues within the soul. He finds in the soul three categories of things: (i) the emotions themselves which the philosopher lists as follows: desire, anger, fear, confidence, envy, joy, friendly affection, hatred, yearning, emulation, pity (ii) the faculties, i.e. our capacity to physiologically express emotions, to feel them, and (iii) the states of character, i.e. the way we feel an emotion under variable conditions. The philosopher indicates to us that neither emotions themselves nor our capacity to feel them qualify as virtues. It is rather the manner in which we feel emotions and under what circumstances which determine an action as virtuous. This we translate as ""states of character"" and therein Aristotle locates the virtues.

**Chapter 6 - the most excellent way**

What states of character qualify as virtues? One answer we can give is „the most excellent ones which yield the most of what is good.“ With that said, it is our task to formulate the nature of virtue as precisely as we possibly can. At this point, Aristotle starts his syllogism with the main proposition that in everything we can find ourselves in one of three situations: **(i)** we have too much, i.e. an excess (e.g. too many wolves in a wild park would deplete the number of deer which in turn would allow invasive species of plants to proliferate.) **(ii)** we have too little, i.e. a deficiency (e.g. too few wolves and we would have a surge in deer numbers which would result in depression of the park flora) or **(iii)** the right amount, i.e. the mean between two extremes (e.g. the right number of wolves would maintain the right deer numbers which together would contribute to a balanced ecosystem overall). To summarise, in everything we find there can be an excess or a deficiency or there can be the right amount which lies between the two former ones and we call the mean.

Now,  what we designate as the right amount, i.e. the mean, Aristotle does not anchor on any fixed number, law or prescription. He  leaves it open and relative to the situation and the people involved. Instead,  the philosopher points to a number of parameters we can consider when we contemplate or practice our actions. To merely feel an emotion is easy. What requires practice is to feel this emotion (i) at the right time, (ii) with  reference to the right object, (iii) toward the right people, (iv) with  the right aim and (v) in the right way. Therein lies virtue.

The point Aristotle makes here is not that we should suppress emotions like e.g. anger nor „get them under control“. Aristotle rather asks us to traverse our anger. What we mean here is that once we have acted out the emotion and experienced ourselves in anger, we recall the experience the best we can and consciously examine it. We may ask questions such as (i) what would have been the best time to express this anger? (ii) what for exactly were we angry in the first place? (iii) did we express the anger towards the appropriate person(s)? (iv) What were we aiming at with our action and what did we actually get? (v) did we overall express this anger in the right way?

One of the mythological backdrops to Aristotle's teaching is the myth of the twelve labours of Hercules. The story begins when Hercules, blinded by rage, massacres his entire family. The hero's first labour of hunting the Nemean lion is an allegory of the hero's confrontation with his own anger. It is only when Athena, the goddess of wisdom, advises Hercules that he wins the fight. From that point onwards, the hero wears the skin of that lion as armour. In the story, this serves as a symbol that Hercules has fully integrated his anger into his self and it now serves him both as protection and as a weapon. Much like an apprentice to a carpenter has to go through many chairs and tables to eventually gain the title of carpenter for themselves, so ought we, the aspiring apprentices of Aristotle, give ourselves fully to the struggle of life. To become strong, we choose to continuously challenge ourselves and actively participate in dynamic social situations which progressively require ever increasing amounts of our will power and emotions. In turn, we will live a more rewarding and constructive life.

To bring this to a close, circumstances will introduce us to many a sophist. They love to moralise about the world and judge everyone but themselves to hell. They gargle the quotes of past thinkers yet never do any actual thinking themselves. They never miss the opportunity, however, to gloat about themselves and point out how they are above the rest of us. They promise that if we accept their „reality of life“ and purchase their service we can be great like them... Ignore their invitations to join their little purity cages and echo chambers. Dismiss their „reality of life“. It is all self-serving hogwash. Instead, let us embrace life in all its richness and pursue to experience it at the forefront as an everchanging process. This is how we learn to live examined lives.

**Chapter 7 - A summary outline of the virtues of character**

We start by stating Aristotle’s premises: In everything, we can have an excess or a deficiency and in both cases we would have the wrong amount. We can also have the right amount which lies between excess and deficiency which we call the mean.

Aristotle’s premises take the form of a dialectics of virtue. What do we mean with this? Two opposite emotions (e.g. confidence vs fear) first bring about two states of character which contradict each other, i.e. two opposite extreme positions. Through examination we resolve the conflict and reach a position between the two extreme positions which is better than either. The thesis is excess, the antithesis is deficiency and the synthesis is the virtuous mean. 
Let us note that Aristotle does not discover the virtues of character but finds them already embedded in the cultural sphere of what we know today as ancient Greece. The virtues are already there and Aristotle instead comes up with the two extremes which according to his model give rise to them. That is why he has to invent some words. With that being said, what Aristotle does here overall is engage us in bringing these virtues together in a comprehensive and coherent system of thought through which he can put them into words, discuss them with us and find out what each virtue means in itself, in relation to other virtues and in relation to our day-to-day human experience. 

Now, let us look at the virtues of character:

**Emotions and Actions** | **Excess** | **Virtuous mean** | **Deficiency**
:--|:--|:--:|--:
**confidence vs fear** | rashness | courage | cowardice
**pleasure vs pain** | self-indulgence | temperance | insensibility
**giving and taking money** (small sums) | prodigality | liberality | meanness
**giving and taking money** (big sums) | tastelessness | magnificence | pettiness
**honour and dishonour** (major) | empty vanity | proper pride | undue humility
**honour and dishonour** (minor) | overly ambitious | ambitious and grounded | unambitious
**anger** | uncontrollable rage | healthy temper | lack of temper
**self-expression in conversation** | boastfulness | truthfulness | mock-modesty
**pleasantness in conversation** | buffoonery | wittiness | boorishness
**Social conduct** | flattery | friendliness | unfriendliness
**Shame** | bashfulness | modesty | shamelessness
**Indignation** | envy | righteous indignation | vicious spitefulness
**Justice** | injustice of taking too much | justice | injustice of taking too little

At the end of this chapter, Aristotle promises that later in this work he will deliberate on justice in greater detail and afterwards deal with the intellectual virtues. 

**Chapter 8 - the perception of virtue from three different points**

Let us take note of Aristotle’s procedure. First, he lays down what we call a universal principle and establishes it as a model of how to locate virtue. He then follows up by locating this principle in a series of particular examples of states of character. This conscious thought movement from one universal to many particulars is what we call deduction. Its opposite, the conscious movement of thought from many particulars to one universal is what we call induction.

In this chapter, Aristotle aims to make us aware of how the mean and each extreme relate to one another. In this way, he engages us in taking a closer look at his dialectical model of virtue [excess (thesis) – mean (synthesis) – deficiency (antithesis)] and puts forward the following propositions:


* (i)	the extremes are both opposed to each other and opposed to the mean

* (ii)	the extremes are more opposed to each other than they are to the mean

* (iii)	sometimes one extreme is closer to the mean than the other


To illustrate the points Aristotle discusses, we visualise three birch trees in a row. The leftmost birch is four meters tall, the one in the middle is five meters tall and the rightmost tree is eight meters tall. The birch in the middle stands opposite to both birches on either side. It is taller than the birch on the left and shorter than the birch on the right. Where the rightmost birch is taller than both other trees, the biggest difference in height we find between the rightmost and the leftmost trees. We further note that in this case, the tree in the middle is only one meter taller than the tree on the left, yet three meters shorter than the tree on its right. Its height is thus not a precise mathematical mean. This is how we thus understand Aristotle’s three propositions regarding the mean and the two extremes. 

**Chapter 9 - Learning how to think**

>""For to find the middle of a circle is not for everyone but for him who knows how. So, too, anyone can get angry - that is easy - or give or spend money; but to do this to the right person, to the right extend, at the right time, with the right aim and in the right way, that is not for everyone, nor is it easy. That is why goodness is both rare and laudable and noble""

Concluding the second book of the Nicomachean Ethics, we quote Aristotle directly and as we read him, we find that his words speak for themselves. All through the ten books which constitute this work, Aristotle lays down his thinking process for us to observe, to examine, to work with and learn from.

Thinking much like walking is something we humans share together in the ability to learn. Unlike the case of walking, however, we do not have the luxury of being  continuously surrounded by people who can model sound thought processes for our sake. Instead, we are left to navigate a world continuously presented to us in the form of haphazard associations of words and emotions. As we strive to learn more about the environment we inhabit, we readily participate in a series of games of reward and punishment that our culture has come to endorse. We feel joy when we get the reward and we know to applaud ourselves for it. We feel pain when we do not and readily point fingers away from ourselves. With age we get to have a few goes at these games and then we grow old and die and the mere result is that we have inherited these games to our children as is and without any guarantee that they work the same way they worked for us.

Through the study of the works of great minds like Aristotle and Goethe, among many others, we can cultivate within us the capacity and enable ourselves to ponder our blue and green orb which we call Earth. Let us learn how to think! Furthermore, much like we once learned how to walk or how to ride a bike, we can also learn to integrate our body and mind and ground ourselves with strong feet on this world. So, as Nietzsche suggests in his essay ""on the use and abuse of history for life"", let us not outsource our view of the world to cultural middle men, which is easy, but let us engage with great minds from epochs past and work on the present age in a constructive way for the benefit of a coming time and because we love life.
