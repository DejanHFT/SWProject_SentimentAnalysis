G Adventures South African,Rink_Roller28,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18o4gwg/g_adventures_south_african/,4,2,"I’m going solo on the Southern Africa northbound tour through g adventures in a few months for 3 weeks and I was wondering if anyone has done this before, anything similar, or has any advice. We are camping in tents basically the whole 3 weeks besides a few days and not going to lie I’m not a camper. I’m trying to be open minded and totally believe it will be worth it but I just wanted to see if anyone has done this specific tour before. I’ve never been out of the country solo and I’m a little nervous but really excited! Thanks in advance for any input"
