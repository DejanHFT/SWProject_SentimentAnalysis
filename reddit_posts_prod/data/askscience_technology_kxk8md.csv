Could the technology behind mRNA vaccines be used to combat cancer?,seanotron_efflux,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/kxk8md/could_the_technology_behind_mrna_vaccines_be_used/,11,20,"For example, could they put mRNA instructions for apoptotic proteins or other inhibitory/interference proteins to a cancer cell's pathways in order to fight it from the inside out? I'd imagine this could either be injected directly into the tumor or the nanoparticle could be modified to have antibodies or other small molecules with high affinity for cancer specific receptors? This would circumvent some cancer's ability to use efflux pumps to export chemotherapeutics from the cell."
