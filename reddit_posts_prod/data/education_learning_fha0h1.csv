Is 'autonomy learning' and 'self-regulated learning' the same?,flashbang258,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/fha0h1/is_autonomy_learning_and_selfregulated_learning/,8,7,"Hi, I'm a senior on English teaching methodology. I'm writing a thesis on language learning strategies and came across these two terms. From what I've read, students in both types are similar in the ways that they can set their own goal, use strategies to achieve the goal and monitor their process.

My question is, can these two terms used interchangeably? Say, for example, promoting learning autonomy also means promoting self-regulated learning (and vice versa).  


Thank you for taking time reading this and helping me out."
