Is there historical context as to why the Abrahamic religious texts forbid homosexuality?,ZiegenJager,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3bgqcg/is_there_historical_context_as_to_why_the/,461,763,"In light of the recent SCOTUS result, a lot of discussion in my friend circles (and quite possibly yours) has been generated. One of the most common points of opposition is that, ""it is simply forbidden in the holy texts."" I'm curious because there has to be some sort of historical context as to why they were written this way. Admittedly, I am somewhat of an Atheist, so I can't simply accept this as a means of opposition.


I am also curious because of some of the history I learned of Rome, in which heterosexuality was a sign of fortitude and dominance (as long as you are the penetrator vs. the penetrated.)


I don't really know, so I'm hoping some on here knows haha. I hope this isn't taken as an 'overtly political' topic. I am now genuinely curious as to the context of the holy texts. 

**Edit**: I must say, there have been some really great answers on here! I wish I had a better way of replying to some of these answers other than, ""cool, very informative,"" and the like. Here is a general thank you to those of you that took the time to answer!"
