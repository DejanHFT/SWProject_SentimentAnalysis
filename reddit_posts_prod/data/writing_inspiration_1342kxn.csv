Is it appropriate to directly admit to your inspiration?,Discardofil,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1342kxn/is_it_appropriate_to_directly_admit_to_your/,8,9,"I have a story I'm just starting which I originally thought of as ""fanfic for the game Grounded.""  It's not literally a fanfic; it has its own characters, plot, and world.  The only similarity is that it's about kids who get shrunk and have to survive at ant-size.  None of which is infringing on Grounded's copywrite.

But my question is, will agents or publishers disapprove of having the obvious source of inspiration pointed out explicitly?  For another example, the series I Don't Want to be the Hive Queen is blatantly a story where the main character becomes the zerg from StarCraft, but it also never explicitly says that anywhere in the advertising or the book itself.  Did the author avoid mentioning it for legal reasons?"
