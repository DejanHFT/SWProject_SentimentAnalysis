Need Ideas for Adventure to Eastern Europe,Rifts605,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1481jso/need_ideas_for_adventure_to_eastern_europe/,2,0,"Hey everyone!

I'm going to start my next big adventure soon, and need ideas.

I'm a 24 year old guy, remote work. From California, but also vagabonded in Argentina and Romania (each for three months, loved both of them), and all across the US. Not in love with how things are in the USA; though there is much to be admired, I think there's much out in the world to explore. Looking to build a life ruled by community, experiences, & love, not objects & work; and I feel that the US, on average, is lacking in this regard.

In lieu of that, **I'm planning a trip for 2+ months, to start in the middle of July.** The goal? To go to a place unlike any I've ever been, forget about technology and first world problems as much as possible, get lost in life, see the Milky Way in its greatness (away from city pollution, ideally), live like a local, and (of course), meet a beautiful, local girl. Maybe fall in love, decide to stay there.

**I'm deciding between going to Eastern Europe or South America, and am open to suggestions in either area. The specific things I'm looking for are:**

1. Very community centric area, not disconnected (in the USA, in my experience, many people are in their own bubble, going to work, coming home, getting on social media, not really connecting)
2. Welcoming of outsiders
3. English speaking (100% open to learning a new language, but want to at least be able to find a few people who speak English)
4. Preferably non-urban. Small town feel.
5. Lots of nature
6. I love volleyball -- everywhere I've traveled so far, I've found an instant community of people by playing
7. I love beaches. I love warm weather. Also, did I mention, I really love women?

What is currently piquing my interest is to fly over to Europe, stay in Amsterdam for a week, then just hop on a train to Eastern Europe and let the adventure guide me by the hand until I stumble on a village that whispers to me *""Ahhh, this is the place.""* Hvar, Croatia is calling my name. As is Varna, Bulgaria. As well as Cyprus (the entire country).

***What cities/villages would you all suggest? Open to any and all ideas.***"
