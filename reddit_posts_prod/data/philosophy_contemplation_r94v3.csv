""Can a man stand alone...without assistance, without diversion, without drink, without friends, without a woman, in silence? Yes. It was possible to stand. Nothing happened. I listened. There was no sound: no boats on the river, no trucks on the road, not even cicadas. What if I didn't listen to the news? I didn't. Nothing happened. I realized I had been afraid of silence.""

- Walker Percy, Lancelot


Anyone who posts videos on YouTube nowadays knows that a little editing goes a long way. One way users often make their videos more attractive and entertaining simply by cutting out that pesky little scoundrel and useless middle-man of information: silence.


Whether it's music reviews (""The Needle Drop"") atheist manifestos (""The Amazing Atheist""), anti-atheist manifestos (""The Atheist Antidote""), or just general ranting (Ray William Johnson) and raving (""Fred""), many YouTubers cut immediately from the end of one sentence to the beginning of the next, stripping their monologues of silence. To quote Max Picard, this technique treats silence as nothing more than ""the absence of speech...like a technical hitch in the continuous flow of noise.""

If the modern world has been waging war on silence for the past few centuries, the internet age - the age of smart phones, 24 hour news, and non-stop entertainment - has struck the death blow. But how did silence go from being, as Confucius called it, ""the true friend that never betrays"" - to our worst enemy?

Jean-Jacques Rousseau summed up modernity's view of silence by saying that ""absolute silence leads to sadness,"" and even comparing it to death. The late Christopher Hitchens agreed, joking that ""the grave will supply plenty of time for silence.""

Some thinkers even saw beyond the cold, empty neutrality of silence and read a viciousness into it - like George Bernard Shaw who called it ""the most perfect expression of scorn,"" or Pascal, who looked out at the stars and remarked, ""the eternal silence of those infinite spaces fills me with dread."" 

This modern un-friending of silence has been like the un-friending of an acquaintance of Facebook. Things got weird, the relationship became awkward, distant, and even strained. So we cut it loose and bid farewell.



But the longer and harder we've fought to keep silence off of our lawn of noise, the more terrorizing its presence has become to us. As philosopher Peter Kreeft puts it: ""Our headphones keep us so filled with artificial noise that we do not hear the deafening silence at the heart of it all...[but] if we dared to listen to 'the sounds of silence', like the existentialists, we would be terrified like them.""


An example: in college, a good friend of mine had just moved into a new apartment, and so was without internet access or television - and for some reason, was without a cell phone as well. She recounted to me a horrific night full of racing thoughts about life, intense self-awareness, and general discomfort, until she was finally able to get on public WiFi. Her lesson? ""Technology saved me from myself.""

We all tend to feel that way about our devices, and it seems harmless. That raises the question: if silence is so uncomfortable and distressing to us, why shouldn't we avoid it? What good can come out of making time for silence?

The answer comes from the existentialists - who, as Kreeft noted, understood the question at hand and weren't afraid to confront it. In short, they tell us that the discomfort of silence is the gateway to a greater comfort than we'd ever known in noise. Kierkegaard put it in medical terms: ""The present state of the world and the whole of life is diseased. If I were a doctor and were asked for my advice, I should reply, 'Create silence'.""

Silence doesn't tell us about itself, but about us - it shows us who and what we are and should be. In Picard's words: ""Silence looks at man more than man looks at silence."" It represents, as Walker Percy put it, a ""kind of beckoning of the self to a self,"" an invitation to confront the ""man in the mirror"" and become more authentic. This new sense of selfhood - even when, and especially if, it makes us nervous or uncomfortable - can draw us into a more purposeful and joyful life.

But silence isn't only about seeing the self - far from it.


A Carthusian monk in the documentary
""Into Great Silence""
Writer Susan Hill notes that the ""rich and fertile soil"" of silence also fosters a deeper awareness ""of everything outside oneself and apart from oneself.""  Or, to use philosopher Joseph Pieper's formulation - silence allows us to steep ourselves ""in the whole of creation."" (Since this contemplation of all reality leads directly to contemplation of being-itself, or the source of reality, it's no wonder that silence is so revered in religious traditions as varied as Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.)

A greater reverence for silence and its effects leads to a greater reverence of speech. Heidegger (and Picard) argued that silence is both ""the origin of language"" and its necessary complement. Without silence, speech becomes meaningless, the mere ""noise of words."" Just as in music, where rests give shape and dimension to the notes played, listening and pausing in speech allows our words take shape and become more rich and meaningful.

Peter Kreeft puts it this way:


""Silence is necessary for speech. It frames it and gives it its wholeness and significance...Only words that come from silence carry power; words that come from noise, or only from other words, are shallow. Words from silence are like waves from the ocean; words from other words are like babbling brooks at best, at worst like emptying faucets and drains and toilets."" 

Without a doubt, our age knows that it's difficult and discomforting to confront silence - maybe more difficult than ever. But I think we also sense that these rewards are waiting for us. This year's best picture winner, the silent film throwback The Artist, is proof of that. It hints at our sense of loss and nostalgia - not just for silent films, but for silence itself. We want, like John Cage, silence to be experienced as something musical - not something which, as Sartre put it, ""screams"" in our ears; we want it to be an occasion to fall in love.


Artist Jean Arp summed up our predicament nicely when he said: ""Man has turned his back on silence. Day after day he invents machines and devices that increase noise and distract humanity from the essence of life, contemplation, meditation. Tooting, howling, screeching, booming, crashing, whistling, grinding, and trilling bolster his ego. His anxiety subsides. His inhuman void spreads on like a gray vegetation.""

Hardly a flattering description of the iPhone - but I think Arp was onto something.

So why not take that first step toward silence, toward ""the essence of life""? Why not carve an hour, even five minutes of the day for silence, and see what we find? Why do we run away from silence? And why do some, like the Carthusian monks, run toward it?

What do they hear in ""the sound of silence""?  "
