Too much focus on wars in history?,Ansatsusha4,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/lex0d7/too_much_focus_on_wars_in_history/,34,20,"I've lately been interested in seeing how different events and movements affected the broader history of the world while I do other things, but I've noticed that most of the videos I can find seem to just focus on wars (esp. WWI&II). While these are interesting, I don't think going into a ton of detail about how the wars were strategized really gives much insight on how events and movements really connect with the rest of history or how they affect the present day. 

What do you think some other important events, locations, or trends need more coverage in history education? 

Also if you have any suggestions for podcasts, documentaries, or channels I can watch that don't focus so much on wars, or focus on less well known events, I would really appreciate it."
