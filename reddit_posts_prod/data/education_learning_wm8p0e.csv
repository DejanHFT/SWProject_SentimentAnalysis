Looking for some guidance on a first week of inquiry-based learning !,AwardPractical104,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/wm8p0e/looking_for_some_guidance_on_a_first_week_of/,1,5,"Hello! I’m a first year kindergarten teacher and though I’ve learned about inquiry or project based learning, I’ve never personally used it or observed it in action long term. The school I am working at uses this approach exclusively, with a heavy emphasis on Montessori and other explorative, child-based methods. Any ideas on how to introduce this during my first week? Any tips on a first year of teaching in general? I could definitely use some help"
