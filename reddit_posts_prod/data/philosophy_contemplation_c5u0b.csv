I am very religious. I want to die. But I will not 'off' myself. Lets talk.,I_kinda_want_to_die,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/c5u0b/i_am_very_religious_i_want_to_die_but_i_will_not/,63,2,"rThis is not a plea for help, Im not suicidal enough to act on it(more on that later). You, or any of my closest friends would never guess that I want to die. I live a normal life. I get good grades. I have a steady(awesome) job... Moving on. I dont enjoy living. In the past, I have contemplated the how and when. I am now past that. I decided to make the plunge and post this after reading [whats the hardest bullet youve bitten](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/c5cua/whats_the_hardest_bullet_youve_bitten). I though do not want to use my main account for this. Being religious (please dont turn this into a God vs. atheist post) I have a firm faith in God and jumping to my point, basically, if you kill yourself you wont have an optimal afterlife. Eff this, Ill just come out and say it. I am mormon, served a mission, still active and all that.. (now srsly, dont plz bash, Ive heard it all, and thats not what Im here for.) I have a couple of reasons for not killing myself. 1. Not making it into heaven. 2. it would be way too hard on my family. So my fear of God stops me. There are many days I twiddle my thumbs almost hoping I get shot or get in a fatal car accident or come down with an incurable disease. But I promise you I wont purposefully crash my car or go looking for sickness. For me I feel I would be held accountable for searching for a way to to die. So I live my life, keep my nose clean, drive safely and such but I still hope that something comes my way.

TL;DR : Want to die, but wont kill myself for fear of God.


EDIT 1:sleep time. more or the morrow. thanks all.


EDIT 2: Thanks for the all the advice. I hope this blanket statement reaches y'all. Ive been quite silent for the past bit, mostly reading comments and thinking on them. 

Ive boiled it down to two points(both have been mentioned)

*  After thinking I think I need to change my lifestyle. Go on an adventure, My daily life is mundane. I need to experience moar. One dream Ive had is to visit(live for a few months) a monastery in east asia, maybe I'll incorporate that into a trip. I feel that my life as of right now has no direction. I will work on that too.

*  After asking around and doing some digging, Im ashamed I didnt know before now, but many members of my extended family are being treated for depression, and have been for years.. TIME FOR DRUGS!(maybe? probably)

another edit: sorry for the canned response of ""I refer you to an edit of my main post, specifically bullet point 2. Thanks."" I just found it easier to do that, rather than type out a similar message for every comment."
