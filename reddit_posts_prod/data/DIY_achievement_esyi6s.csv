"Mounting a security cam outside my window. The camera can conveniently screw on to a protruding screw on my AC unit. Only issue is that the camera faces straight ahead, rather than down. Is there an adapter that can help me achieve a lower angle?",mrat93,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/esyi6s/mounting_a_security_cam_outside_my_window_the/,22,5,"https://imgur.com/gallery/pXc7Uos

I’m trying to mount my security camera outside my window, facing the front door area. I don’t trust the included adhesive to last on the side of the AC unit  or on the house side panels. 

I noticed that the camera will securely mount on the screw protruding from the AC unit. I love the idea of using this, as it would be way more secure being screwed on a stationary object. The issue is that the camera will point straight ahead into the horizon when mounted on the screw. 

My question is, can i find a doohickey of sorts from a hardware store that will add a couple of ball and socket arms to adjust the camera? Ideally one to extend the camera away from the unit and another to achieve the desired angle."
