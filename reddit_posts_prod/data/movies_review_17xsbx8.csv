**Reviews**

**Observer 4/4**= The legendary filmmaker has returned, thankfully, to deliver one of his best, most imaginative and mature movies yet.

**Daily Telegraph 5/5**= In its giddy resistance to being pinned down, it reminds you of Miyazaki himself: the stern traditionalist still delightedly pushing back the bounds of his craft.


**Times UK 4/5**= There are flashes of Hitchcock, 2001: A Space Odyssey and even Back to the Future, and while the director’s films can be earnest, it’s often very funny.

**VOX, fresh** =The Boy and the Heron revisits many of Miyazaki’s themes — loneliness, fear, sorrow — with his signature imagination and underlying reflection of Japanese history.

**Slant Magazine 3.5/4**= The true tragedy of The Boy and the Heron seems not to be that the blemishes of its fantasy mirror those of its reality, but that any one person should think themselves capable of sanitizing either.

**The Atlantic, fresh** =The Boy and the Heron may or may not be Miyazaki’s final movie, but either way, it’s a staggering addition to one of animation’s most totemic filmographies.

**Toronto Star 4/4** = If this is indeed a farewell address from the Ghibli co-founder, it’s a grand statement.


**Autostraddle, fresh**= Something about the ephemerality of each film maybe being the last feels especially fitting for Miyazaki.


**Deadline Hollywood, fresh**= Yet, for all its strengths on a conceptual and technical level, the story lacks a strong focus. Still a decent send off to a fantastic career.


**Insidehook** =The Boy and the Heron, a farewell feature... unmistakable in its satisfying yet heart-pulverizing finality, represents the master’s effort to make his peace with the impossibility of peace in his lifetime.

**Financial Times 5/5**=  In The Boy and the Heron, the feelings of grief and determination get under your skin without relying on the mission-oriented plotting of many on-message Disney features.



**Synopsis**

A young boy named Mahito yearning for his mother ventures into a world shared by the living and the dead. There, death comes to an end, and life finds a new beginning. A semi-autobiographical fantasy about life, death, and creation, in tribute to friendship, from the mind of Hayao Miyazaki.
