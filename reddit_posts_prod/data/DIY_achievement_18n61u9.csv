Any online videos about ‘grading’ your yards so that water slopes away from your home?,peanutismint,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/18n61u9/any_online_videos_about_grading_your_yards_so/,2,3,"We had some water leak into our basement from almost every wall during our last big rainstorm (PNW). While I’m not expecting this to happen all the time, I know that I’ve got hours were completely clear as I had them done about two weeks prior, so a side room installing a sump pump my next gas is that we need to do a better job of grading the yard so the water flows away from the house rather than sitting in pools near it, which is what it was doing during the storm.

In our case, while our front yard slopes away reasonably gradually to the sidewalk, the backyard is more or less flat, and the small patches down the sides of our house also seem to even slope down toward the wall of the building.

The problem is, I don’t really know the wording used to describe this kind of work, so it’s hard to search for DIY videos about how to achieve it yourself on YouTube. Does anyone have any good links talking about the basics of this process?"
