**Book α – Notes**

**Chapter 1 – (a) Prologue and rehabilitation of previous thinkers** For the most part of Book A, Aristotle did not just settle for a historical account of his predecessors. He offered an elaborate critique of them. He voiced his disagreements and pointed out the things he felt they investigated poorly, those they completely missed, those they got wrong. 

Foremost of all though, through this exercise, he categorised these thinkers in groups according to their particular methods and beliefs. He recognised their contribution to the pursuit of sophia. He talked about them as founders and forerunners of that continuous conversation we call the ancient Greek philosophical tradition. Finally, he placed Aristotelian philosophy at their feet.

**(b) sophia as truth** Here, Aristotle makes a distinction between two types of knowledge: (1) if we want to gain mastery over some type of activity (e.g. ballet dancing, carpentry) then what we seek is practical knowledge. (ii) If, however, we want to gain knowledge of the first causes and principles which cause the being and becoming of all things, then we are philosophers and seekers of the truth. For these principles are eternal and indestructible. They are not caused by other factors, yet cause the existence of all things. They are true for a single dustmote and for the entire universe at the same time. They are, therefore, always and unfailingly true and in this way the most true. Sophia is truth itself.

**Chapter 2 – prerequisites for the existence of truth** In Bk A:Ch. 3 Aristotle proposed that in order for us to truly know something, we have to be able to give 4 types of explanation about it. These are popularly known as the 4 causes: (i) material, (ii) efficient, (iii) formal, (iv) final. Now, when it comes to some one object, particularly a human creation, looking into its 4 causes may be a simple process. For example, we could find out that a table is of the farmhouse style (formal), made of oakwood (material), by a carpenter (efficient), for the purpose of dining (final).

In Aristotelian thinking, the four causes constitute a unity. Like four pieces of thread, the knowing of each cause come together and tie into a knot of knowledge for one particular object. This knot of knowledge constitutes that object as completely comprehensible to us. Nevertheless, this is only an intermediate region of clarity within a much greater and much more elusive totality. In this treatise, Aristotle ventures to contemplate the very fabric of the cosmos from what threads and knots he and his precursors stitched together.

Aristotle fully embraces the notion that there can be true knowledge of things and find himself in complete opposition to Herakliteans *(„world is in constant flux, no knowledge is possible“)* and relativist sophists *(„man is the measure of all things“)*. He sets forth two preconditions for the universe to be comprehensible, i.e. for us to be able to truly know and understand it:

(1) The causes cannot be infinite in sequence. There has to be a first beginning, whence all is pushed into existence and a final end, a goal for whose sake all comes to be.

(2) The causes cannot be infinite in variety. There has to be a finite set of causes which determine a thing, whether we are talking about a tree or a planet.
     
**Chapter 3 – conclusion of introduction** Aristotle concludes by informing us that the best starting point for this material is natural science and not pure mathematics.
