Focus motor alternative,jaypat0199,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/18j1kpr/focus_motor_alternative/,0,2,"Hello,

https://preview.redd.it/o4xqatqb0h6c1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdbf65bf3149df313b69d144ac798d9a70454bfb

I hope this message finds you well. I own a DJI Ronin-S gimbal, and I'm exploring the possibility of creating a DIY solution for focus control. The Ronin-S comes equipped with a focus wheel on the handle designed to connect to a focus motor, allowing precise adjustments to the camera lens.

Unfortunately, I don't have the dedicated focus motor. However, I'm wondering if there's a cost-effective way to create a DIY mechanism that enables the movement of the focus wheel to translate into adjustments in the camera lens focus. My goal is to achieve this without investing significantly in a motor.

There is a specific constraint I need to address: I cannot introduce any tension from the handle to the top of the gimbal where the lens is located. Doing so would adversely affect the balance of the gimbal, rendering it ineffective for the smooth recording I intend to achieve.

Any insights, suggestions, or DIY ideas would be greatly appreciated. I'm open to creative solutions that maintain the balance and functionality of the Ronin-S while allowing for manual control of the lens focus.  


If you want to know about the motor, you could watch this video by DJI: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzMqN6rxOGg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzMqN6rxOGg)

Thank you in advance for your time and expertise.

Best regards,

Jay.
