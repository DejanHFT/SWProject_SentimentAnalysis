Creativity while living with SO.,Witty-Standard7632,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/t5xlha/creativity_while_living_with_so/,6,4,"Hey yall,

Sorry in advance but I couldn’t think of a place to ask this question besides somewhere that designers, artists, and ultimately, creatives hang out.

So i’m 24 about to graduate with a BFA in Visual Communication Design. Lately, I’ve been having difficulty creating and sometimes I feel like it’s because I share a room with my girlfriend of 1 year.

Before moving in, I was pushing myself more creatively. I was making clothes, painting, and doing digital illustration. I just don’t feel as inspired at the moment. I love my girlfriend but sometimes I crave my space that I had before I moved in. Sometimes I fantasize about moving to the inner city and renting a studio alone. A place where I can create in solitude and find inspiration. 

To summarize my question: do yall think having personal creative space is important to your process? Do yall feel more inspired when you’re alone? And if you are an artist in a relationship, what’s your setup like?"
