Who were some famous historical figures that were around during the same time but didn’t ever interact?,LackFundsPleaseHelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/alarma/who_were_some_famous_historical_figures_that_were/,1503,5958,"I was thinking today about how Saladin was alive during Genghis Khan’s rise to power, or how Kublai Khan died only 3 years before the Scottish rebellion led by William Wallace, or how Tokugawa Ieyasu became shogun the same year James the VI of Scotland became king of England as well. What are some of the more interesting examples of famous figures occupying the same era? 

Edit: not sure guys but I think Anne Frank and MLK may have been born in the same year."
