G Adventure Single Room or Share?,blueeeV,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/103ecjb/g_adventure_single_room_or_share/,6,1,"Hi all!

So after years of dreaming of going to Japan, I'm finally beginning to plan it.

Because I'm planning on going to Japan alone and it will be the first time I'm traveling on my own I'm trying to decide if getting my own room would be good or not?

I'm looking at a 9 day G Adventures tour (https://www.gadventures.com/trips/japan-express-osaka-to-tokyo/5550/) and was thinking of adding on 2 days in Tokyo because I want to check out Akihabara for some anime stuff, the Tsukiji Fish Market and the Pok√©mon Centre. 

1. Does 2 days seem enough to do these items? The tour is only spending a day and a half maybe in Tokyo.
2. I was thinking of just room sharing with another person as I want to use the tour to try traveling on my own and meeting people. If anyone has done a tour and room shared with someone they don't know - what was your experience?

I'm very excited to meet people and explore Japan with others but also want to be able to do things on my own so I can see if I can do more solo travel in the future. 

Appreciate any advice!"
