"Who else has wrestled with writing doubts like ""Can I really write?"" and won? Looking for inspiration and actually... seeking advice...",Quirky_Breadfruit317,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18v5qb9/who_else_has_wrestled_with_writing_doubts_like/,12,3,"Hey folks! So, here's the deal: by day, I'm all about product design and UX stuff - Day job shenanigans. But after hours, I'm tinkering with apps, dabbling in game development, and other fun stuff. But here's the thing – I've got this huge love for stories. Seriously, I've been toying with the idea of writing a book for what feels like forever.

But... there's always this little voice in my head asking, ""Can you actually write something good?""

I mean, I love my ideas, but every time I thought about putting them down, I'd hit this wall of doubt about whether I could write well. It's like having a cool game concept but doubting if you can code it... did that make sense?

But, guess what? I finally broke through that wall. About five months back, I hunkered down and actually finished my first draft. It's one of those ideas I've been kicking around forever. For at least ten years, I've been starting and stopping, but this time, I made it to the end.

I gave myself a bit of a breather after that – sort of stepped back to let it all sink in. And now, here I am, ready to jump into plot edits. But I've got to be honest – that old fear, just when I thought I'd shaken it off, it's creeping back in.

So, I'm throwing this out to you guys – anyone else been in this boat? How'd you kick those doubts to the curb and just start writing?"
