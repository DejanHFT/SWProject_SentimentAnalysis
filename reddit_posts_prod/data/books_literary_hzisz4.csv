"Do audiobooks pass the literary ""Turing test""? Why or why not?",chillyhellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hzisz4/do_audiobooks_pass_the_literary_turing_test_why/,68,6,"I read ebooks and listen to audiobooks and enjoy both for different reasons; however, I often see complaints that ""listening to an audiobook isn't \*really\* reading"".  I thought it might be fun to tackle that discussion another way.  

(from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test)) The **Turing test**, developed by [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to [exhibit intelligent behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.  

It's the idea that a sufficiently advanced machine may some day be able to converse with a human in a way that doesn't reveal to the human that the correspondent is actually a machine.  

To bend that theme to another purpose, do you think it's possible for an imaginary group of people - some who have read a book in the traditional sense and some who have listened to the audiobook - to hold an in-depth discussion about a book without giving away their method of reading?  Why or why not?  If you were a party to the discussion, would you be able to determine each person's method of reading without asking them direct questions about narration or reading process?  

If you would be able to tell the difference, are the differences meaningful?  

Finally, setting aside the in-depth discussion, do you feel that traditional readers and audio readers get the same benefits out of reading?  If not, are those differences meaningful?"
