Classic/Traditional Western Movie Recs? With John Wayne or Gary Cooper?,erinius,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16mo3ft/classictraditional_western_movie_recs_with_john/,16,3,"I recently came to the realization that the older Western movies I like are in fact revisionist Westerns, and I haven't actually seen a single traditional, non-spaghetti, non-revisionist Western, so I have no direct exposure to the original genre that these revisionist Westerns were critiquing and building upon. Could anyone recommend some old, pre-1970 or so traditional Westerns to watch?"
