How to achieve this look in a dorm?,ss_valpaca,https://i.redd.it/s6ly8rgu6clb1.jpg,17,6,"This is probably a dumb question for all the super talented people in this sub, but I would like to achieve a look like this in my next college dorm. Particularly I like that the placement of the fabric looks “unplanned”. I think I have the necessary materials, but I can’t tell what they did here to hang it up. Also, since I will be in a dorm I can’t use anything permanent like nails or curtain rods. Thanks for the help!"
