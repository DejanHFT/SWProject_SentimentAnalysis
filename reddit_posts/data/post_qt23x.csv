I'm a scientist and with all the recent stories in the news about data fraud I really wonder how much the average person trusts in science and the research process?,Sifl_And_Olly,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qt23x/im_a_scientist_and_with_all_the_recent_stories_in/,22,3,"I'm a biological graduate student at Michigan State University. A constant topic of conversation in my seminar courses is the public's perception of scientists. A classic case is the lack of scientific evidence linking vaccines to autism versus a celebrity spokesperson (Jenny McCarthy). Why is it that people are more willing to listen to a celebrity than actual scientific evidence? I understand that there was evidence linking the two, but it's come out that that scientist made up all of the data. Unfortunately, this is most likely detrimental to the public's trust in actual science.

How trusting do you think people are in regards to scientific research? Sometimes it seems pretty low to me (cough, global warming, cough). What is the missing link between scientific results and the public? Education? Media spins? How detrimental is it when a case of data fraud rises to the surface? How can we gain people's trust? I'm interested in other scientists point of view on this topic as well as those who have no scientific background. "
