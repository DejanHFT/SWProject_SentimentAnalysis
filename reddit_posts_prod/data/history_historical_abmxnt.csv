However, not all subjects are covered equally. If you could pick a subject seldom covered by popular media from history to be made into a tv show or film franchise, which would it be?

For fun's sake, let's say the budget is limitless, so go nuts.

My personal pick would be the final siege of Constantinople in 1453, I believe it's got all the makings of an epic, long odds, larger-than-life figures, and a heart-stopping finale."
