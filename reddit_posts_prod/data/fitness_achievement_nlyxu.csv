My biggest achievement ever!,kaiwolf26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/nlyxu/my_biggest_achievement_ever/,26,399,"Today I went to the gym, and I started working out as usual. Half way through, my old personal trainer comes in and pulls me to the side. 

My gym has a member recognition program for people who have made big improvements and regularly attend the community center once a year. There's something like 15-20 spots open or something like that.

My old trainer pulled me aside to tell me I've been nominated for my improvements and dedication for attending this year, and I'm going to be one of the people with my poster on the wall!

I just wanted to thank everyone here for helping getting me here, and I'm looking forward to another year of improvement!"
