Over the span of 9 days we will visit Kuta, Kubutambahan, Ubud, & Gili Trawangan. 

1. Do I really need to bring a lot of “modest” clothing? I do want to see a few temples so I know I will need modest clothing for that but what about regular outings? I like to see a lot of nature and beaches and don’t really want to wear long sleeves and pants in these areas. If so can I get a recommendation for 1 lightweight long sleeve dress that can easily fold in my backpack so I can just pop it on whenever I am somewhere that requires modest dressing. 


2. I have Tricare select insurance. It says I can see any overseas provider & to just keep my receipt. Will this be accepted as travel medical insurance?


3. Luggage issues. I have a tour booked with G Adventures. Over 9 days we’ll visit 4 cities. I plan to bring a 25.5 x 16.75 x 11 in suitcase. How do they bring the luggage with us to these different places? I assume everyone else will have one the same size. Will they keep our bags secure while we are traveling or is this my responsibility? I plan to bring a TSA approved lock but will make sure the lock will be ok for international travel as well. 

Not sure if these questions require additional information, but if they do just let me know☺️."
