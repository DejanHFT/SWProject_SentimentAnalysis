strategy game like monopoly,Aggravating-Assist18,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/yr8x4k/strategy_game_like_monopoly/,11,1,"Is there a strategy game like monopoly (referring to the trading and buying businesses aspect) that doesn't have luck and is instead skill based that allows you to play against other players? 

If not, is there a strategy game where you can manage your own business and compete against other players business that doesn't have luck?

Edit: I guess I should mention that I'm looking for video games that have online play or board games converted into a video game that have online capability. I unfortunately can't play board games as often with my friends right now because I moved so I've been sticking to online games not tabletop games for the time being"
