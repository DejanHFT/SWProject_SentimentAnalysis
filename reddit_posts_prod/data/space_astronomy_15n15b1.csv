It's starlink.,hippychemist,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/15n15b1/its_starlink/,538,5520,"To answer your question.  Starlink.  That strip of lights slowly moving across the night sky is starlink.  They launch in strings, they launch often, and there's a fuck ton of them messing up astronomy.

Mods, pin this answer or start banning it or something.  Please.  It's all I see from this sub anymore.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk."
