I dont know how to support my friend whenever she freaks out,Anxious-Variation861,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18cfkg8/i_dont_know_how_to_support_my_friend_whenever_she/,20,4,"my friend of 3 years (28f), recently got a bunch of money and decided to pay for herself and I (18m) to go overseas. 

it was going pretty well (as far as I am aware) until a little over a week ago she started getting realy mad at me over small things and then a few days ago she was crying at me about how I'm like my father (we both don't like him, for different reasons) and calling me a shit friend. I tired to listen and console her but anything I said made her more mad so I just kinda checked out of the conversation.

later we both apologized, her for comparing me to my father and me for not being perceptive of her emotions. It didn't end tho cuz the next day(? Idk time is hard) she was almost immediately pissed at me again, because I didn't figure out that she was upset until she was yelling and crying at me. I was pretty zoned out the rest of the day and litteraly can't talk wich sucks. I tried to explain to her that I don't mean to not talk but she's taken it as a personal attack against her.

she freaked out more later and I rly tried to help. I found a breathing exercise video but it pissed her off more and then she said it would've  been better if she never brought me on this trip and that she only brought me with her so that I could help her when she freaks out (wich kinda hurt but she's stressed so i don't think i can hold it against her). I didn't know this but if I had known I probably wouldn't have come because there is no way that I'm equipped to handle anything like that.

I tried to stay out of her way after she said that, because she said it would be better but she was even more pissed and I realy don't know what to do cuz any time she crys or yells I can't move or speak and I want to help but even when I can do something she just gets more mad. Idk

sorry if this post seems venty or there's anything wrong with it, I've never posted on reddit before but i'm happy to change anything I need to and answer questions and stuff

TLDR: my friend is stressed and keeps freaking out and I never know how to help and often freeze up wich pisses her off more"
