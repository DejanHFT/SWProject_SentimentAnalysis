What is the best way to write an Asian inspired world for a fantasy book?,SpookyQueenCerea,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1637vr0/what_is_the_best_way_to_write_an_asian_inspired/,33,6,"I really want to have an Asian / Eastern inspired country to my fantasy world. I keep looking back at the backlash to Raya and the Last Dragon and how poorly that movie handled Southeast Asian culture and that is something I deeply want to avoid. So, I am just wondering what would be the best and most respectful way to do it? Thanks, I have been stuck on this for a bit."
