Bought a fryer.  Fun/tasty things?,Elderman,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/igkle/bought_a_fryer_funtasty_things/,14,4,"I decided it was a great idea to purchase a fryer while buying groceries yesterday.  Picked this one up from walmart: [FryDaddy, $23](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Presto-FryDaddy-Elite-Electric-Deep-Fryer/11080477).  Pretty cool hunh?  I made beer batter chicken, and a beer batter oreo (was not great.)  Before I risk creating something that would require incredible amounts of hunger to actually eat, do you have any awesome ideas?    

So far my next victim is fried pickles and I eventually want to fry ice cream.  And eggplant to make eggplant parmesan.  "
