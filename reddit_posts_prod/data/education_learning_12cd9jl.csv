How do you help a child to learn new language?,Readinglob,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/12cd9jl/how_do_you_help_a_child_to_learn_new_language/,29,18,"I was asked to help my 10y old nephew to learn English (it's not his native language). We've been meeting up for a month now, but he never learns new words I ask him or watches educational video I send him. And basically, just straightforwards asks of me to tell him the correct answers to his homework.

Is there something I can do, to help him find interest in the language? Or do I give up?

P.s. he's used to copying homework from his classmates."
