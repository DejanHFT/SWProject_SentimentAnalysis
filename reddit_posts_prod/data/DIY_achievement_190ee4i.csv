How to reduce gap between dryer vent cover and house,potatomonger,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/190ee4i,14,2,"Predominantly need the top portion covered to keep moisture coming in from above, but eliminating all of the gap would be ideal. The angle of the vent cover needs to stay at about what you see so that we donâ€™t overly strain where it joins the dryer. 

We have space filling foam, but seems a little intense to try and fill all of the gap with just that as the foam would be exposed to the elements.

Any suggestions on what material to use and how (technique, tools)? Or other ideas to achieve moisture and bug control at the gaps?"
