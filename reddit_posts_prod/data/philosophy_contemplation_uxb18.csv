Two followup questions to a post on Nihilism.,RedLinedUser,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/uxb18/two_followup_questions_to_a_post_on_nihilism/,25,0,"I had two followup questions to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ui77k/what_are_the_arguments_against_nhilism/) about Nihilism.  

I was looking for arguments against it and got some great ones that explained how to find meaning outside of absolute Meanings.

I had two followup questions to this:

-What about the idea that ""the unexamined life isn't worth leading"". If examining life deeper and deeper leads to the conclusion that nothing has any absolute meaning, isn't that the way we should think on an everyday basis if we don't want to life an 'unexamined life'?

-Someone mentioned not to set your anchor too far and tether everything to absolute ideas. Does this preclude you from contemplating these larger questions that we can never really know the answer to? Does it mean that one can't come up with personal theories, perhaps sometimes more poetic than logical, that for a moment seem to explain something of the universe and bring wonder and fascination, and enjoy these moments? 

Edit: A third question, kind of in line with the second, can you still enjoy transcendental moments (eg being in awe of a natural wonder, a feeling of oneness with the universe through meditation etc.) even though you know that they aren't bringing you close to any actual absolute meaning?

Edit 2: Something similar to the second one... I might pick up a habit that reminds me of childhood and that feels good.  I could just say that it brings to mind warm feelings of nostalgia but I like to organize it into this larger idea of 'the return to childhood', a unity within your life story etc., and then looking at it like that, as a general concept I feel good.  It almost does feel like I'm part of something larger than myself by experiencing this larger concept.  Is that inconsistent?  Do I have to break it down to its component parts so that there isn't any vagueness before I should be allowed to enjoy something?"
