I’m curious: What inspirations from the real world has leaked into your stories?,Spoon____Spoon,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1669cxy/im_curious_what_inspirations_from_the_real_world/,34,18,"I like the practice of being inspired from real events/people and putting into stories I make, so I wonder who and or what are you guys taking from?

This doesn’t have to be historic inspirations, but one’s that could be from an authors experience too of course! (Yet for me, I am not that big a fan of self inserts. Even though at the end of the day you see some trace of yourself in the story you write)."
