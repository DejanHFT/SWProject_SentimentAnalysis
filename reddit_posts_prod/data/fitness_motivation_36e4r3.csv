How do you guys keep motivation high at the gym? How about getting back on the wagon?,nfrmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/36e4r3/how_do_you_guys_keep_motivation_high_at_the_gym/,83,15,"When I'm heavily into the gym, I try and switch up workouts often.

When I'm trying to get motivated again after a gym break, I focus on one really specific thing like handstands, planks, stair climbing and get back to 100% from there.

Would be interested to hear what you guys do.... ðŸ’ª

edit: Thanks for sharing you guys! Hopefully everybody reading is as inspired as I am right now :)"
