Mesmerizing Jordanian Adventure,Thom2XX1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/11uu1s3,23,323,"Photo order jumbled from what I wanted to have it set at!
My breakdown:
If you are planning on going to Jordan - GO! Combination of breathtaking places, amazingly hospitable people and great food made it surreal.
I did a 9 day Gadventure tour and 5 days solo, to the likes of Wadi Mujib, hot springs and chilling in Amman.
I can't stress enough the importance of the app Careem for cheap transport and other services because like everywhere else taxi drivers will try to rip you off."
