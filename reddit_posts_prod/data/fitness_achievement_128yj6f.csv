How I finally achieved perfect form pushups,Dire-Dog,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/128yj6f/how_i_finally_achieved_perfect_form_pushups/,25,29,"M/28/5'8/140lbs here. So I've been struggling with push ups for a long time. I could never seem to get the form right. From feeling the wrong muscles working, not going down all way, not having my elbows at 45° etc it felt hopeless. So I went back to square one and grabbed a protractor, drew out 45°s on the ground and recorded myself doing some reps. If my elbows weren't perfectly inside the lines I didn't count it. I started small, doing a couple of reps here and there, focusing on feeling the muscle. It took months of work but I finally got 10 perfect form pushups. I was so happy I cried, all that effort had finally paid off! 

So if you're struggling with perfect form, go back to the basics of doing a couple of light reps and go from there. The slower the better"
