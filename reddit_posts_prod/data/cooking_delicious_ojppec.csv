Which delicious dishes do not last overnight?,CreatureWarrior,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/ojppec/which_delicious_dishes_do_not_last_overnight/,47,8,"I live alone and usually cook 3-4 days worth of food. I just ate pesto pasta for three days a week ago. It was delicious. But a few days ago, I made pasta carbonara for the first time. I made it for me and my mom and we both loved it. 

There was one serving left and I ate it the next day. The flavor was right, but the whole dish had just dried up into this spaghetti *dish* (as in the circular hard object). It was not a good experience. 

I even tried throwing a little water in the bowl and putting the lid on to cover most of it so it kinda steams it a little in the microwave. It helped a little, but not much. Another dish is lasagna, at least in my experience. It always turns into this hard block over night and doesn't come back to life no matter what I do. 

So, what other dishes don't really last properly or have to be eaten the same day?"
