I’m a literary translator Eng > Rus AMA,Subornator,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5virif/im_a_literary_translator_eng_rus_ama/,88,90,"I am a literary scholar, author, university teacher and conference interpreter, but apart from that, I have been working as literary translator (in most cases jointly with my wife, Alexandra Borisenko) for many years. Among the books we have translated into Russian are Julian Barnes’s “Flaubert’s Parrot”, Nassim N. Taleb’s “The Black Swan” and Hanya Yanagihara’s “A Little Life”. I am currently working on Yanagihara’s first novel, “The People in the Trees”.
