Aspiring traveler here! What is the best way to explore all 50 states?,TheEggHeadedOreo,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18v47ag/aspiring_traveler_here_what_is_the_best_way_to/,21,0,"Would you recommend driving or flying to most of the states? I’m based in Cincinnati so obviously I wouldn’t fly to michigan or like illinois. But what about other states like texas, florida, etc… I feel like I can cover more states at a time if I drive but I want other opinions. Also, is there a website or something that I can see like to-dos at each state? Thanks!"
