"If you had to choose a woman author to represent the literary heritage of your country, who would you choose, and why?",Catladylove99,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11ifxg8/if_you_had_to_choose_a_woman_author_to_represent/,190,97,"This is based on the recent post from u/Alcinado which asked the same question without specifying a gender. Since the answers are nearly all men, I was curious what women writers everyone would choose for their country. 

I’m from the U.S., and I would probably choose Louise Erdrich if forced to narrow it down to just one, but Toni Morrison and Barbara Kingsolver would be close behind.

Edited to add: The US is a very diverse country, which makes it hard to choose just one writer to represent our literary tradition. I chose Louise Erdrich primarily because she’s such an outstanding writer with gorgeous language and really unique and interesting stories, but she’s also Native American and many of her novels and stories represent this perspective (of course there are many different tribes and many different native perspectives; Erdrich is Chippewa). 

Toni Morrison’s writing is incredibly rich and vivid, and I love how she captures different times and places in US history in her novels. She really brings you into the perspective of her characters and makes you feel like you’re there with them, and she deals a lot with themes around the experience of Black Americans. 

Barbara Kingsolver also has really lovely prose and has dealt with themes around US intervention in other countries/regions (for example, the Congo in The Poisonwood Bible and Central America in Animal Dreams) and especially around the experience of working class people in the American south (The Bean Trees, Prodigal Summer, Flight Behavior, Demon Copperhead). 

Someone commented Amy Tan, and I think she’s a great addition to this list. She has written a lot about the experiences of Chinese American immigrants and their children."
