What movie(s) did you grow up thinking incorrectly were major elements of American cinema?,TriviaJedi,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16h6ugh/what_movies_did_you_grow_up_thinking_incorrectly/,282,141,"I’m talking about those movies that you grew up seeing at just the right age or that had a special spot in the hearts of your parents such that you watched them multiple times, and you were so familiar with them that you just presumed everybody had seen them. 

Then one day when you’re older, you realized the movie wasn’t the universal cultural experience that you thought it was.

For me, there are plenty of 80s films — like Enemy Mine, Innerspace, & Throw Momma from the Train — that my dad loved & would put on every now and then. I just assumed as a kid that everybody in the world was as familiar with these as they were with Star Wars & Indiana Jones.

What movies were like this for your childhood?"
