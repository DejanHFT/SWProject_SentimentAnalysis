Best melodies for toddlers?,SaicereMB,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/18gsxej/best_melodies_for_toddlers/,11,2,"I'm trying to teach a toddler some stories set to basic tunes and melodies (e.g: The Illiad set to the tune of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star) but I'm struggling to find enough songs for this, what are the most basic beautiful tunes or melodies (I'm thinking something along the lines of The Beatles or Buddy Holly or some ultra basic classical music) that would foster a toddler love and ear for music from the ground up?"
