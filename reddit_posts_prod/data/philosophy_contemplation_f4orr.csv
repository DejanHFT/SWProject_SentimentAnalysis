Just some random bits:

Atheist.

I see people that work as suckers grinding their lives away being miserable doing something 8 hours a day they can't stand doing, while I am comfortable living home, not caring what people think of me, sucking up welfare, free health care, and living meagerly while having an abundance of time to soak up information and fun. I feel so much more informed and cultured than most people my age by far, and it makes me sad instead of feeling like I'm better than them for it.

I have goals in life to become a professional actor or film maker and currently put a lot of time into furthering both, but if any goal i have never comes to fruition, I don't care; since when I'm dead, nothing will matter either way.

Cannot stand American right-wing ideologies. I don't understand how people can tout having reasonable discourse and agree to disagree with a smile and go on their merry way when these people are fighting to destroy the very way you want to live your life and what you believe to be true to fit their agenda based on greed and religious teachings. They in my mind are a literal enemy to my well being, and I am theirs. This is the kind of thing wars have been started over yet we're expected to be all jolly towards one another and just laugh it off saying ""Bah it's only politics, let's have a beer!"" Fuck that. 

Cannot stand rap or modern country music, Tool is one of my favorite bands though. 

Love art and looking at pictures. 

I have a constant battle in my head about whether the death penalty is the worst thing ever or if it should be used more liberally to set an example and force people to being more ""nice"" to further along the idea of creating a ""utopia"". I truly believe no country has a right to decide the fate of their citizens, but then again you can also look at it like fighting fire with fire and get rid of all the assholes out to do others harm. 

Love animals and I rage when I see or hear about animal torture, yet i do eat farm raised meat. I see it as a necessary shitty thing and I don't deny my humanity. I know I don't HAVE to eat meat to survive but that's the way the circle of life has always worked, life feeds on life. I don't think farm animals are capable of even contemplating life or death anyway, and I don't think their perception of mortal danger is the same as ours either. When humans think they're truly about to die, a lot goes through our heads because we get more from life than simpler creatures and have more to lose, and death to us is obviously 100 times more horrible of a thing than an animal. I think part of the whole vegan thing is because the people partaking in it like to over anthropomorphise animals, and they falsely believe that they must feel and perceive everything like a human does.
