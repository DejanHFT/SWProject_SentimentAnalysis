bon iver is really fucking good,themightygotenks,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/wpzo19/bon_iver_is_really_fucking_good/,858,6828,"I've listened to essentially his whole discography front to back multiple times this week. for emma forever ago is gorgeous, self titled is gorgeous, 22, a million is gorgeous, i, i is a litle rough around the edges but still gorgeous. the mans songwriting skills are insane and his voice feels like being wrapped in a warm blanket, sipping hot coco on a cold winter morning. it makes me feel things very few artists have ever made me feel before, just complete melancholy security and closeness. so yeah...that's all i had to say. go listen to bon iver if you haven't."
