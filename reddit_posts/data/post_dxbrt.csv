While I was peeing, I thought it was just a fart... I was wrong. I'm stuck in the bathroom. What do I do!? I've already been in here 15 minutes. Help

update: I threw my underwear out the windo into a bush. my pants arent dark enough to hide what happened. no clear path to my desk or a door. how do I get out!

update2 tqless: I'm on 2nd floor. there's a small piece of dirt where the bush is and concreet. should I jump? what if I break a bone. 




update3: I have a friend on the way to try to thorw pants into the restroom but he is far away

update 3: friend is mia I got out the window. sped down to target, grabbed a new pair of (horrible) pants. omw back to office. I hope no one notices my poants are different

update4: back at the office now. i feel like people are staring at me. 

update 5: wtf guys?! this wasn't supposed to hit front page. people read redit here. people know. I'm screwed"
