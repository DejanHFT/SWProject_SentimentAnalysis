1RM: Does it apply for machines as well?,soorin1993,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/62ogjd/1rm_does_it_apply_for_machines_as_well/,18,12,"So I've recently began doing weights (super beginner, have only done cardio my whole life) and wanted to know what my goal should be so looked up the average weight people pull, and found 1RM. It said that the lowest 1RM for a woman is my body weight X 1.8lb. So that means for a 140lb girl, I should be doing 250lb??? I only today hit 120lb on leg press machine and that was extremely hard so now I'm wondering if I'm extremely weak or if I'm doing the math wrong. "
