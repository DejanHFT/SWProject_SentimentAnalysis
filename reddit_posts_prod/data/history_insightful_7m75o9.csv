"Life in medieval village of Montaillou, described in detail (names and personal lives) thanks to the recordings of a local inquisition chief and his interviews with locals",Falsh12,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7m75o9/life_in_medieval_village_of_montaillou_described/,237,5567," I will try to summarily describe the context of my title as well as the book, it being the incredible insight in lives of locals.
The man, Jacques Fournier, was obsessed with recording nearly everything, and during his few years of chasing heretics in southern France (early 14th century) , he conducted hundreds of interviews/interrogations with locals, ranging from peasants to clergy and nobles, recorded nearly every word on paper and later brought those texts with him when he became the Pope, so they survived.
In 1975, using those texts as a basis a French historian wrote a very fun book called ''Montaillou'', by the name of the village that is the focus of the story. Book doesn't have a fictional story, it simply follows the village over those years, using Fourniers texts as a basis.  Amazing thing is that the said village still exists, with the same name and the same place (as do all surrounding villages). Right next to it are remains of a small castle/fort which was mentioned a lot in the book.

The reason why Montaillu is the subject of a modern book is because 25 of the interviewed people came from that village - a village numbering less than 200 people. That gave as an incredible insight in lives of ordinary people, who were ironically immortalized by the man that they were afraid the most - by immortalized, i mean that we know their names, their occupations, their private problems, their opinions of their neighbors, their world view, religious view, the course of their life over those 10 or so years.

For example, we know that the village had a castellan from the local noble family of Foix, he and his wife being the only nobles in the village. Community being small, he was practically the ''jack of all services'' doing various work, both policing and helping the local populace in anything needed. His wife was a lot younger and after he died she left the village and moved to the one next to it. She had quite a few lovers, including a local clergyman. Interesting thing is that she had quite a normal friendships with local peasant women, e.g. she would meet a girl she knows and they would hug in the middle of the street and chat like any modern neighbors.

People almost never spent time inside their own house except during night - when not working, which was quite often because of mad number of free days, people would visit each other, spending time in other houses or simply in the field or street, chatting all day. Also, it is described that a lot of people lacked certain things in their own homes (which were practically one room houses with no furniture), so those that had things like oven or certain tools, freely landed them to their neighbors.

A village had a small tavern with a barmaid who brought beer and occasionally wine at the doorstep of her customers, by order. Folks used to travel quite a lot (which is surprise to me since i always thought medieval peasants never went anywhere), visiting festivals and fares in towns up to 50 miles away. They also took their grain to the local town (Ax-les-Termes, still exists)  some 20 miles away nearly weekly, since the village didn't have a mill. Some men occasionally visited the same town because of prostitutes - the town possessed a nearest brothel, and inquisition seemingly had no problem with it.

The political opinion of locals is well described by one of the heretics ''There are four evils in this world - the satan, the king of France, the Pope and our local bishop'', quite describing that their world view was somehow very limited. In other details it can be concluded that their knowledge of the world didnt expand further than 100 mile radius.

Atheism was of course punishable, but there were few people here and there who publicly gave some atheistic claims, like:

A witness told Fournier that Raimond deserved to be put to death for saying that Christ was not created through divine intervention, but ""just through screwing, like everybody else.""

Guillemette of Ornolac, was brought in for interrogation because she doubted the existence of the soul. She expressed the opinion that what is referred to as the “soul” is nothing more than blood and that death is final. When Fournier asked her if anyone had taught her these ideas, she answered: “No, I thought it over and believed it myself.''

Mortality of course was very high, and was viewed by locals as an absolutely normal thing. Death of a child was nowhere near traumatic as it is for modern women. Hunger was periodic - there were practically alternating periods when they ate a lot and were practically getting fat, and then periods when they would be on the verge of starvation - this happened within the year, with early spring being the worst period.

And so on and so on, for more details there's the book,   anyway i recommend this book to any history fanatic, but to anyone else too really - it's much more fun than it sounds, and it kind of humanizes the famous peasants of medieval times, showing us that they weren't nearly as stupid or ape-like as portrayed in movies. They weren't too different from some highlanders that right now live in semi-isolated places of Appalachian mountains or northern Scotland etc.

Village today (the church is very well preserved from the time of the story and still functioning, while the castle is just a ruin)
