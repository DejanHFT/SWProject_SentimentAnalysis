On the chaos of design creativity !!,na7oul,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/p5h1ct/on_the_chaos_of_design_creativity/,4,1,"I'm a designer on the not school side . i admit that i have less knowledge and pratice than graduated designers but i'm learning everyday and that's so satisfied .

I don't have problem when working for clients where i have a clear brief but i want also to work on my own creative projects  and i find it the hardest part . I have ideas that i want to see out but between the idea and the execution there is a big gap . i mean that i find a cool concept after i stop because of the chaos of  choices (what style to choose ? , what color ? , what technique ? ...) and add to this some procrastination and the project is gone forever .

Lot of artists have their own styles but i'm not in this case and i don't know if i really agree with using always the same style .

It's very personnal thing but i'm wondering if someone is on the same scenario and how to force execution ?

Sometimes the thing that work for me is to start , just start and the result is not that bad but most of the time my ideas stays just ideas

Thank you for reading"
