Would it be possible for a highly motivated student to learn the entire 10th grade math curriculum in two weeks with the support of a math teacher?,caprisunswiftie,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/196zeag/would_it_be_possible_for_a_highly_motivated/,52,0,"I am trying to transfer to a different high school than the one I am at now. The reason for this is this other school offers a sought after IB program I would like to get into. However, I just discovered this three days ago, and with the Thursday application deadline looming, I meet all requirements but one. I am the top of every one of my classes (just received the award for highest average and awards for every one of my subjects) and am completely bilingual. However, I need my grade 11 math credit to get into this program. Most students would take grade 10 math first semester and grade 11 math second semester, however I didn’t know this even existed until a few days ago. I have an excellent teacher who also teaches functions and calculus in the higher hm grades who has offered to help me with math, but I’m wondering if it would be possible to acquire all of the grade 10 math in two weeks so that I could do my grade 11 math next semester and meet requirements for this program. Thank you for answering me and sorry if this post was redundant or grammatically incorrect, English is not my first language."
