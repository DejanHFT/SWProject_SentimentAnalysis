Should I leave my apartment job and life in NYC to explore London for a month?,caligirl3294,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ungxtz/should_i_leave_my_apartment_job_and_life_in_nyc/,60,81,"Hi! I’m 26 female, have lived in NYC for 4 years. I currently live in a 2 bed with a roommate. I told her I’d resign our lease with her even though I’m kind of getting sick of New York and I have always had this dream to move to London and live and work there for a little bit. I really hate my job BUT it pays me 6 figures and for right now, I’m able to still work from home. I have had this strong feeling inside of me to either quit my job and move to London for the month of June or to keep my job and just work New York hours while I’m there. I know some of you will think that quitting my job is irresponsible and I agree with that but I hate it. I’m miserable everyday, bored, unmotivated and not passionate about it. I have side gigs like dog walking and social media that I only make a tiny bit of money from but that fulfill me way more than my corporate job. Any advice here?

I’m also applying to jobs in London but I have a feeling it’s going to be tough to land anything since I live in the states - any advice here as well?

My question is, should I follow my gut and go to London? Of course I’ll have to really work hard to figure out where I’m gonna stay and I know it’s gonna be quite expensive. Or should I be more logical/responsible and maybe go next year when my lease is up and I have more time to find a job there potentially?

I just have this strong urge to travel while I’m young and not tied down. A lot of my friends in NYC are in serious relationships, they like their jobs and have flourishing careers and I’m just not at that place. I don’t want to look back on my life and regret not taking risks and at least living in another city in my 20s. I don’t know what to do."
