"In your opinion, what movie reflects todays world/society the best? (Not just the pandemic)",WDOR_,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/s6fn20/in_your_opinion_what_movie_reflects_todays/,40,0,"I saw an interesting question somewhere that if you had to pick a movie, that would reflect todays society/world,  what would it be and I have thought about it quite a lot and I could not come to a any title. I have thought of Parasite, because it is a social critique, but I am not sure if this is the right decision. What do you think? I would like to know your ideas!"
