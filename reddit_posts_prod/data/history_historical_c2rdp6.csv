What innocuous event spiralled out of control in the most historically-significant way?,bpastore,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/c2rdp6/what_innocuous_event_spiralled_out_of_control_in/,306,243,"The example commonly used to describe the ""Butterfly Effect"" is ""a Butterfly flapping its wings in New Mexico can cause a hurricane to strike China."" What historical event *should* have been nothing more than a Butterfly flapping its wings... but quickly changed the course of human history in ways no one at the time could have seen coming?

Edit: Excluding scientific discoveries or advances in engineering (e.g. ""oh, that's what happens when you split an atom!"")"
