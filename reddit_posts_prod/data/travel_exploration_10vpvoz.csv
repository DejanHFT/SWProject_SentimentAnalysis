So I am going to the Isle of Skye, Scotland, and Inverness February 15-25! I wanted to know of any hidden gems that my fiance√© and I could explore?  


So far we have, Quiraing, Old Man of Storr, Fairy Glen, Fairy Pools, Kilt Rock/Mealt Falls, Brothers Point, Culloden Battlefield, Loch Ness, Urquhart Castle, Cawdor, and Staffin Beach!   


Any and all suggestions!!!"
