Best Historical Army(s)?,Swedish_Crimea,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5plvlo/best_historical_armys/,61,13,"What country do think had the best army, historically for me it's something of a tie between Prussia and Sparta. Perhaps we should order it by era? ie.

Ancient = Sparta

Medieval = ??? Mongols, Byzantines, French ???

Modern = Prussia"
