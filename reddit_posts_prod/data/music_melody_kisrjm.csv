Melody repetition,FallenDisc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/kisrjm/melody_repetition/,1,4,"Do you guys also get extremely annoyed and angry when you see other music makers straight on copy paste melody from different songs, put own lyrics and call it their own? I realize that music despite being an massive library of sounds its hard to come up with something original, but come on, why copy other's ideas?

Examples
Abba - Gimme Gimme = Madonna - Hung up
Madison Mars - New vibe who dis = Riton & Oliver Heldens - Turn me on

There are plenty more who do this but I took just those as examples
If there is some reasonable explanation for ""Why do people do this"" please explain"
