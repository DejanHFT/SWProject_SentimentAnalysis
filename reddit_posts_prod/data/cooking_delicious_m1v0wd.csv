Do you ever cook food and not have any desire or appetite to eat it after even if it is delicious?,2021TimeToChange,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/m1v0wd/do_you_ever_cook_food_and_not_have_any_desire_or/,324,3480,"I enjoy cooking. Still fairly new to cooking. I especially enjoy eating food others cook. But when I cook, even if it comes out delicious, I don’t have that same excitement to eat it after. I don’t know if it’s being tired right after, or all the tasting in between to get the spices right ruined my appetite. Or maybe cleaning up and washing dishes before eating. This happens almost every time I cook. I usually cook for 4 other people, which makes up for my lack of excitement, especially if they enjoy it.

Edit: After reading comments, I think it’s worth noting that I cook a lot of Indian food with so many different spices. Based on a lot of comments I read, this could play big part in my experience. I will try 2 weeks of non-Indian cuisines and see how I feel."
