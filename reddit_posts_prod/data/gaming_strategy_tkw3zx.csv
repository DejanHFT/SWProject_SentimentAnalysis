Turn-based strategy on Android,Metasenodvor,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/tkw3zx/turnbased_strategy_on_android/,10,1,"I need a recommendation for a turn-based strategy on Android. Now there is a catch and I dunno the exact name of these kind of games. 

I need this game to be have an option of 24h (or more) per turn. So all the players have 24h to input their moves and then that turn plays out.

It also needs to be able to support a fairly big number of players (at least 150).

I've played AgeOfConquest4 for a long period of years and made some friends. For some reasons I've stopped playing it and need a new game to transfer to. Something like AOC would be perfect for my gaming group. We won't play noblemasters (the AOC creator) other games"
