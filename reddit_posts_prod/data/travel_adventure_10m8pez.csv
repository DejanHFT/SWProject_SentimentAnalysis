Other Adventures like Ciudad Perdida,RespectedPath,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/10m8pez/other_adventures_like_ciudad_perdida/,10,13,"In 2019 I went to Colombia and just sort of stumbled upon the Ciudad Perdida trek in my research. Long story short it wasn't just a highlight of this trip but one of the my most meoribale events of my life. I really didn't know what to expect as I just went into the tour blind. I really enjoyed this experience. We would spend all day hiking yet meal breaks and rest breaks were planned and the tour company arranged for the meals and lodging along the route. We slept in beds buy under a canopy, outdoors. It was an adventure in a box and want to do something like this again. I'm open to anywhere in the world where there is fun to be had. Does anyone know where I can find another experience like this?"
