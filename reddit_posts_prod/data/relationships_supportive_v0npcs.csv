My (16nb) incredibly supportive boyfriend (16m) has plans to help me move out to the U.S.,edgycatman,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/v0npcs/my_16nb_incredibly_supportive_boyfriend_16m_has/,7,0,"My incredibly supportive and responsible, amazing and adorable ADHD-ridden boyfriend has talked about me many times with plans to help me move to the U.S.

I live in Europe, unemployed, dropout because of severe social anxiety, you know - the usual status of a young adult.

I have no current plans for a job, no passions, no real hobbies to say, and have been leeching off of my dad mainly, I have no idea what I'm going to do with my future and quite frankly have been horrified at the thought for years upon years, as I march closer to my 'doom'.

But recently, my boyfriend has started talking to me about the idea of flying me out to the U.S.

It's such a spontaneous thought, I'm very irresponsible and clumsy, I don't know the first thing about any laws even! So I don't know what I'd even have to do! Would I need to get like a visa or something?! I don't even KNOW what a visa is.. or how I can become a U.S. citizen.

I am definitely into this idea, in a way - my boyfriend is literally saving my life from being broken due to my incompetence, and I am forever in debt to him for that. He is really really responsible, even has plans to help me get a job as a counselor of sorts at a camp once I arrive there.

I don't know any of the logistics of going from the EU to the U.S. - I'm only a bit away from turning 18 so I really need to be educated soon, because this is a huge huge opportunity to me, not just at living, but at being with someone I really really love, possibly forever.

I really need some advice on how to handle this situation, what mindset I should have, how I should feel, how I could even go to the U.S.? Is it as simple as buying a ticket, boarding a plane and just walking into his house? Is that IT?

TL;DR: Boyfriend wants to help me permanently move to the U.S. and get a job - and I want to know what this means to our relationship and how I can make sure I can't possibly screw this up.

I would love some advice dearly, about what this means to our relationship and how I can take this moving forward and not be so dang scared, thank you everyone. <3"
