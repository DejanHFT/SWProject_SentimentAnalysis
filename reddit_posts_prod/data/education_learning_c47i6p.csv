Has education ruined the love of learning and reading for recreation?,Johndope2402,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/c47i6p/has_education_ruined_the_love_of_learning_and/,46,103,"The other day I ran into into a former student who graduated (College) and asked how they were doing. This person had mentioned that she was just relaxing and just glad that she would never have to read a book again. She had graduated and landed a great Full time position making an above market entry level salary.  Which made start think more deeply:

The more education that people acquire, the more I have started to notice that people tend to not want to learn for recreation or read just to relax. They view it as a traumatizing experience or a memory that they were forced to read and study extensively for classes that left them physically, mentally, and overall emotionally fatigued. 

So my question is does anyone have any ideas how we could combat this ideology or stigma attached to learning and reading for leisure? At this point even settle for watching an informative documentary. Or am I crazy and this seems like an isolated incident?"
