Motivation issues...,tomkatt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1sgpve/motivation_issues/,14,6,"Been working out steadily since late April, but for the last month or so I've been struggling to keep motivated. It's been predicated by some health issues (diabetes diagnosis and a switch to a low carb diet), followed by some extreme cold weather in my area that just leaves me feeling lethargic and makes my hands and knees ache.

It's frustrating, and I'm at the point where my 3x a week workout is more like a 1.5 to 2x a week now.

Any tips on how to stay motivated despite the problems and the winter aches and blues? I want to do the workout, my body is feeling it, but I can't seem to get my head in it. I feel like I'm dreading workout days instead of being excited like I've been in the past."
