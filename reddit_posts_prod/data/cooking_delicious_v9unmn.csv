"Salt preserved limes, even more delicious than salt lemons",mranster,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/v9unmn/salt_preserved_limes_even_more_delicious_than/,76,577,"[Salt limes ](https://freeimage.host/i/hlod5g)

This is super simple to make. I used my food processor to slice some organic limes, about eight of them. It's best to slice them thin, because otherwise I end up having to cut them up when I'm cooking.

Once sliced, sprinkle a little salt in the bottom of a jar. Lay in some lime slices, add a little salt, and just keep layering them until you run out of lime slices. You can use a muddler to mash them down. You want the juice to cover the fruit.

I like to put a smaller jam jar in, and screw down the lid, to keep the fruit submerged. You can use a pickle pipe or an airlock to keep air out. Let the jar sit on your counter for a few weeks. The lines will undergo some color changes during that time.

Pickled limes are a fabulous ingredient. You can blend some into yogurt or oil, for a delicious salad dressing. If you mix it with yogurt and put it in the fridge overnight, you will make a really interesting sour cheese.

You can stir a spoonful of the limes into any savory dish that you would use regular limes in, and it will have a much brighter flavor."
