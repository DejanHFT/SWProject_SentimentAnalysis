Subreddit idea for inspiring writers and illustrators,didgeboy287,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/ae2gtk/subreddit_idea_for_inspiring_writers_and/,81,87,"So I know r/WritingPrompts is the go-to place for finding/posting specific story suggestions. There's even a way there to use an image as a prompt. I suggest making an entire sub out of that latter idea as a way to bring illustrators of all kinds together with writers. I've never made a sub before, though, so I thought I'd feel out the writing community first.

I want this sub to have a few purposes: simply posting images as writing prompts, artists posting their work to both promote themselves and inspire writers, writers giving artists prompts to help them flesh out a story, writers posting their work seeking illustrators, and eventually writer/illustrator collaboration.

What do you think?"
