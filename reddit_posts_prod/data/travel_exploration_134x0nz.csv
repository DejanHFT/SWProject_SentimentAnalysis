Advice for an Introvert Exploring the Balkans,Thereitis155,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/134x0nz/advice_for_an_introvert_exploring_the_balkans/,3,2,"Hi everyone,

I'm thinking about taking my first 2 week solo trip in July. The rest of my trips have been 8 days or less. I plan on spending 3 to 4 days in Serbia, Bosnia, Albania, and Montenegro. I have found through my travels that my sweet spot for travelling is a week give or take. I travel alone and spend my time alone and I find I get bored/lonely after about a week of travelling and want to go home. Does anyone else feel this way? I was thinking maybe doing city hopping and not spending too much time in one spot. By moving around in different environments often I will always be in awe because I am experiencing new places regularly. Curious if anyone has been in this position."
