Where do you draw your inspiration from? Books or Events? both?,JeNkaiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18yjr5q/where_do_you_draw_your_inspiration_from_books_or/,2,0,"Personally I feel like the choice is obvious; both. But if you had to choose 1?

But I feel like for the overall idea, like fresh blue print would you rather base it off other books plot ideas or historical events from the past? 

Of course, it doesn't have to be a 1:1 of what it is. I also mean specific events not eras. 

I was thinking of writing a short pirate fantasy book but it's based off the events of the Storm of the bastille. I'm trying not to make it just ""Rebels take over government control"" but something more of course but what do you guys do?"
