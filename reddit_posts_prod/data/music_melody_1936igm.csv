Other songs with same melody,sw0oOosh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1936igm/other_songs_with_same_melody/,6,4,"Dear Redditors,

I need your help and don't know where to go so I'm asking the music experts here.  

I think you all know the song ""Send me on my way"" from Rusted Root. The song is very iconic and was used in known movies like Ice Age or Matilda.

I feel like I have heard the melody of the first 20 seconds as background beat in a different song. Somehow my brain screams ""Shaggy"", when I listen, but I don't recall any of his songs with this melody.

Do you guys know any other songs, where this exact melody is used?

Much appreciated!"
