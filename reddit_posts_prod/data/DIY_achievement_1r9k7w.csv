How to achieve a similar look?,tboxer854,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1r9k7w/how_to_achieve_a_similar_look/,3,2,"Hey All - was hoping someone might be able to shed some light on how I could achieve a similar look to this photo http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqclhcaUQB1qees8xo1_500.jpg.  Would home depot or someone similar sell strips sized out like that?  What is the easiest way to attach them to the wall and ceiling?

Thanks!"
