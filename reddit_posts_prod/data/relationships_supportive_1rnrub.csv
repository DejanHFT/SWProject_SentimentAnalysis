My bf [23M] has been lying to me [23F] for a year about his marijuana use. Expects me to be supportive through withdrawals.,thrwy1013,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1rnrub/my_bf_23m_has_been_lying_to_me_23f_for_a_year/,64,5,"My bf and I have been together since we were 15 (8 years). I should mention we both live with our parents until we're done with school. At the beginning of our relationship neither one of us smoked weed. He was against it for a long time since his dad has always smoked and is somewhat of a jerk. About a year and a half ago (April 2012) we got some to take with us to Coachella since I didn't want to drink there. I do not have a problem with people smoking or weed in general. In fact, I enjoy smoking from time to time. 

I started nursing school August 2012 and if anyone of you have ever been you know it's highly demanding. I was at school 4 days a week and working in between. My bf, at that time, wasn't working or going to school. He had applied to nursing school and his start date was Aug 2013. He had just finished an EMT course but never put in the effort to find a job as one. Anyway...my first semester of nursing school was very hard for me. I was constantly stressed out, getting no sleep, and hardly eating. I ended up quitting my job so I can concentrate on school. During this time, he wouldn't call me or really care much about what I was doing. I would study for days before a test and he never cared to ask how I was doing. He showed pretty much no interest, he wasn't coming over anymore and when he did he stayed for a short time. He wasn't taking advantage of the days I could see him and I couldn't really understand why. 

Well, 2 months into my first semester we're hanging out and I knew the night before he was out with his friends (I don't have a problem with it, I'm at school anyway and I thought I could trust him enough). Well I ask if he smoked and he said yes. I gave him a hard time about it since I wasn't smoking because of school. I'll admit at first it was a jealousy thing. I thought he shouldn't be able to smoke if I can't. Our conversation turns into a fight and he ends up telling me that he has been smoking every day since Coachella (5 months). I start feeling sick to my stomach, how could he keep something for so long from me. We had a long talk in which he apologized and told me he was going to quit. I was sad and the added stress from school just made me feel like shit. 

That weekend, I stay over at his parents house. I usually sleep over when I have nothing going on the next day. That weekend he was going through withdrawals. His hands and feet were sweating, his temper was short, he felt sick and was in a bad mood. That's when I knew it was real. I stayed and supported him even though I was angry that he kept it a secret for months. It made me doubt myself. Was I not around enough? Why didn't I notice? Why did I trust him so much?

Fast forward to my 2nd semester, I pretty much learned to deal with the fact that he lied and wasn't so sad/mad anymore. At the end of the semester I told him I wanted to smoke with him and so we spent part of my break getting high and hanging out. I assumed he was just doing it with me since I wanted to. 

I am currently at the end of my 3rd semester (1 more to go!!!). Now recently we've been having problems with his temper and general disinterest in me (again). I would stay over his house, his excuse to smoke at night was so we could have better sex (I didn't mind but then again I didn't know he smoked all day everyday). By the morning his temper would be short, he would tell me ""You wanna go home and meet up later"" to get me out of his hair (so he could smoke). I still didn't know at this point he never stopped smoking. One morning about a week ago we started fighting and he just drops the bomb. He never stopped smoking for a year and a half. He would go from not wanting to be with me, not wanting a gf, and then deciding he does want to be with me. He says that I love him too much and I'm too good to him. 

Sometimes he tries to rationalize it and say it's a hobby, people still function properly on it. Normally I would agree with him but I see how it changed him and I don't think it's right. Other times he sees how it changed him and even said it himself it's debilitating and he doesn't want to depend on anything to make him feel good. So for now, he says he wants me around but I have to be nice to him, I can't be mad if he slips and smokes. I think I can help him out but it's only if he lets me. I try telling him that I am his friend and he can talk to me but he doesn't give me the chance. I really don't know what to do. I want to help him but I also want to protect my feelings. 

**tl;dr**: Bf of 8 years has kept smoking weed for 1 1/2 years a secret and now expects me to support him through withdrawals and quitting. Wants to decide after he quits what will happen to our relationship. I don't know what is right for me and I feel like I'm getting strung along."
