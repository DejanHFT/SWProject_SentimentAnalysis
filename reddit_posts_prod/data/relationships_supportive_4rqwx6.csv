Me (26F) with my husband (42M). Married two months, dating 14 months. I just had a very traumatizing physically emotionally draining surgery and he just went off on me and refuses to help me at all.

My husband and I have been married for two months. From the beginning of our relationship until a couple of months ago, he has been nothing short of amazing to me in every way possible.

I am a sound designer/composer/recording artist. When we first started dating I was waiting table to support myself in between jobs. I despise waiting tables and being dehumanized by assholes everyday. I wanted out and I wanted to secure a good future for myself and my future family. I decided to go premed and do music on the side. I went into EMS in the meantime and just stated my med school prereqs this summer. I have been extremely stressed out and busy because I am taking 3 classes in one summer semester. I literally eat, sleep, breath, and study. But I am doing all of this for us. 

Then about 10 days ago I found out I was pregnant. It was a total accident, unplanned. I decided to have an abortion because we were not financially ready for a child. He was supportive at first. But then, I began to get extremely ill. Nausea, vomiting, crying for no reason, rage for no reason, the works. Every single little thing irritated me because of the hormones and as a result I did snap and was rude quite a few times, but I literally could not help it. Irritability is a medical symptom of pregnancy and not something you can just ignore. That’s like saying “stop being nauseous.” Or “stop being cyanotic.” I have PCOS, a hormone balance as it is, so when I get pregnant, I go extra crazy. I truly cannot help it. He continued to take offense over everything whenever I would snap.  I was so, so physically miserable.

Then today I go to have the abortion. I have had only one other abortion before. That time they had me awake with some sort of IV drug that made me super loopy and everything was just fine. I thought this time would be the same. They said “oh, yeah, we’ll give you Xanax and numb the area with lidocaine, it’s not bad at all.” Well it was oral Xanax, not IV xanax. I have never been in so much pain in my entire life. I screamed bloody murder begging them to stop and afterwards I was in more pain than I had ever been in my life, and that’s saying something because I have a chronic pain condition. It was terrifying and I won’t be surprised if I develop some long term mental trauma from this. 

When he came to get me, I told him I needed to go to a pharmacy first asap to fill the pain med script. That’s the other thing, they wanted to give me ibuprofen afterwards. I was like “are you fucking serious, I am in agony and I am allergic to ibuprofen. You seriously think ibuprofen is even going to touch this kind of pain???” They gave me tramadol which is still crappy. I got hydrocodone with my first abortion. 

Anyway, he didn’t want to stop at the first pharmacy we see and instead drove all the way home first even though I am in AGONY. Get to a pharmacy, get script. Then we go home and I said, hey they told me to eat something as soon as iIget home, if I order from nearby restaurant, can you go get it because I can hardly walk. 

Then he says, “Sorry, I have to get my haircut at 2:30.” WTF. I said “you were stupid enough to schedule a fucking hair appointment on the day of my surgery? Don’t you think this takes precedent? I am in no state to make something to eat or go pick it up (too poor to afford delivery.) Then HE goes off on ME, saying “I’m sick of all your shit, you’re selfish, all you care about is school and you. blah blah blah, so on.” I was like sorry I just had surgery. Don’t you think I’m a little more important than a stupid haircut at this very moment?

Now I am sitting here, really upset after a horrible surgery wondering if I should end this marriage after this incident. I have never been so angry at someone who I thought loved me. I don't expect him to wait on my hand and foot and I know his daughter is here and we're trying to keep this on the down low because of her and he wants to spend time with her. But am I wrong to think it was totally fucked up for him to leave me a in a groggy, traumatized post op state to get a fucking haircut when I could hardly walk and needed to eat something as per post op instructions? 


   
**tl;dr**: Had abortion, my husband chooses to go get a fucking haircut instead of helping me with post op.

Edit: Thanks for all the advice everyone. I'm going to take the evening to calm down and recover and we are going to discuss it in the morning.

EDIT 2: We had a long talk this morning and everything was ok after that. Now he is pissed at me because he wanted me to help clean the house and I was in too much pain. I am really upset and crying. On top of this we are having a team over at our house to compete in a film festival competition and I don't think I can handle strangers right now"
