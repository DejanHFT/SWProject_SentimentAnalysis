What kind of wall texture is this?,LopsidedTown2030,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18va8c2,3,1,I need some help trying to match wall texture for a patched area of drywall. Untried the can of orange peel but I don't think that is the correct texture. Is this just a roller texture fo some kind? How do I recreate this?
