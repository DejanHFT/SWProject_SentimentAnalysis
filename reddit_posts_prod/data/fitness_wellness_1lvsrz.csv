Do those shake bottles with the metal wire balls in them work well?,ikeandmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1lvsrz/do_those_shake_bottles_with_the_metal_wire_balls/,50,9,"I'm considering buying a shaker bottle that had one of those metal wire balls in it.. do they work well? I just want to mix milk and protein powder (specifically chocolate muscle milk). I thought the powder might clump up with this kind of bottle but I think it would be more time efficient than using a magic bullet. So, reddit, what do you think?"
