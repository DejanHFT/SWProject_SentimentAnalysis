SO and I have different goals. How do I manage meals at home/grocery shopping/cooking/etc?,snobbletree6409,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/10uggn2/so_and_i_have_different_goals_how_do_i_manage/,138,731,"Hi! My SO and I will be moving in together very soon. This means eating the same meals (in a way) and cooking together, etc. however, this is causing some concern for me.

I was previously very overweight and lost 50 pounds between 2019-2020. Since then, I’ve been maintaining my weight by practicing healthier eating habits (eating when I’m hungry, listening to my body, generally smaller portions, lighter calorie alternatives to things like sauces, drinks, etc). I go to the gym, exercise and do all of these things to manage my weight and keep it at a healthy level, which helps me feel my best. 

My SO, however, is in a very different situation. They go to the gym in order to get bigger, build up muscle, and gain weight. As a result, they find themselves looking to eat more food and consume higher calorie meals (full/higher calorie options, supplements, extra meals, etc) to match their needs.


When we move in together, how can we ensure we are still both eating meals that help us reach our goals? Should I focus on smaller portions and they focus on larger portions of the same meal? Should we focus on having slightly different foods made from many of the same ingredients? What are other options for helping us both meet our wellness goals while eating and living together? Anyone who can share experience with this situation or advice on how to navigate it, I would be so thankful!! 

TIA! :)"
