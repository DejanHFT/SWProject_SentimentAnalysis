What can I learn in-person in 1-2 weeks?,Careful-Salad-2080,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/19b2zgu/what_can_i_learn_inperson_in_12_weeks/,5,0,"I'm looking to take on a new educational challenge - i'd like to learn something new, that's taught in-person and hands-on.  Taking a week or two (40 - 80 hours).  It should be rewarding, but doesn't need to be a pathway to earning money.  I'm expecting to register and pay money for this!  I'm currently in San Francisco, but don't mind traveling.

I'm interested in broad topics, such as Permaculture design, things that create new experiences, and make me more interesting in small talk.
