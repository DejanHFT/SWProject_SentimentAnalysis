"/r/philosophy Open Discussion Thread | November 25, 2019",AutoModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/e1kkpd/rphilosophy_open_discussion_thread_november_25/,50,6,"Welcome to this week's Open Discussion Thread. This thread is a place
for posts/comments which are related to philosophy but wouldn't
necessarily meet our posting rules (especially
[PR2](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/rules#wiki_all_posts_must_develop_and_defend_a_substantive_philosophical_thesis.)).
For example, these threads are great places for:

* Arguments that aren't substantive enough to meet PR2.

* Open discussion about philosophy, e.g. who your favourite philosopher
  is, what you are currently reading

* Philosophical questions. Please note that /r/askphilosophy is a great
  resource for questions and if you are looking for moderated answers we
  suggest you ask there.

This thread is **not** a completely open discussion! Any posts not
relating to philosophy will be removed. Please keep comments related to
philosophy, and expect low-effort comments to be removed. All of our
normal [commenting
rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/rules#wiki_commenting_rules)
are still in place for these threads, although we will be more lenient
with regards to CR2.
