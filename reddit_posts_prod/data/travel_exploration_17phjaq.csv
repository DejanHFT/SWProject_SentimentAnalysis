Searching for beach vacation that offers some exploration/adventure as well,Affectionate-Ad9489,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17phjaq/searching_for_beach_vacation_that_offers_some/,42,8,"Trying to plan a 10th anniversary trip for my wife and I. We have the money and have always thought Hawaii looked awesome - but I am tallying up the price and seeing that it could easily be 7-10k for a week in Hawaii in early April. I'm not really into spending that much money on a vacation, though I could if that's the best option. Also, we are from Ohio and that's a lot of flying - I kind of hate flying.

We also have liked the idea of Carribbean, and partly because some of the islands are a much shorter flight. We don't really want to just go to a resort and end up being stuck there.

I'd like somewhere there is room to explore - whether by bike, or car, or hiking. I had this idea of driving the Florida keys, which sounds like a small unique ""adventure"" and while also not having to pay for a flight or car rental. (I could drive from Ohio to the keys and save a lot of transit costs - though that's about 2 full days each way - hardly a good use of time).

Also, our kids get us sick all the time and we don't have the best health ourselves - so I'd need flexibility to cancel the trip if we get sick and it's important that there is good healthcare available wherever we go, just in case. Trip insurance and travel health insurance are just more expenses.

I'm just not sure how to find a relatively adventurous vacation while also being able to keep the costs down. Any ideas would be great!"
