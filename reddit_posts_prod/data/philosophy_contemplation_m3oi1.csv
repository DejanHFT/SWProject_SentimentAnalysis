Question about Identity,rednesh,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/m3oi1/question_about_identity/,28,11,"This has probably been discussed before. I don't consider myself even an armchair philosopher, but recently a question concerning identity and consciousness crossed my mind; if I go to sleep at night, am I the same person when I wake up the next morning? Or am I actually an entirely new identity, consisting of the total sum of all memories and experiences that all previous identities have accumulated, created anew every time I gain consciousness and extinguished every time I lose it?

Does anyone have any good articles or own opinions on that?

edit: Thanks for all the input, I hadn't expected anything more than maybe a few helpful links. I have to take care of some things now, but I'll try to reply to every question/argument as soon as I can. Anyone, feel free to add something.
