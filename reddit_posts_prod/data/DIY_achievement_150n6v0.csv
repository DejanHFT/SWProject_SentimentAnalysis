Sandwich panel water cooling ?,_Alexxander,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/150n6v0,5,1,"Hello
We work and store garments in a 1000 sqm warehouse covered with aluminum sandwich panels …


The thing is that the temperature here is super hot, it is around 45 °C. Indoor usually it is around 35 °C.


The idea is that we spread irrigation pipes across the roof, we would turn it on couple of times per day … 

This would result in moisturizing the aluminum that would result in cooling the indoor couple of degrees…

I know that there is tons of methods that could give better results , however we are looking for a method that is super cheap and could be done DIY …

Is this a good idea ? How many degrees colder we could achieve from this in the indoor ?"
