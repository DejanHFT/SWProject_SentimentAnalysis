I’m Lucas Richert, the historical director for the [American Institute of the History of Pharmacy](https://aihp.org/) at UW-Madison, a nearly 80-year-old institute dedicated to advancing the knowledge and understanding of the history of pharmacy and medicines. I’m also co-editor in chief of [Social History of Alcohol and Drugs: An Interdisciplinary Journal](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/shad/pr/180921) and author of a new book with the MIT Press called “[Break On Through](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262042827/),” which draws on archives and government documents, medical journals, and interviews, and interweaves references to pop (counter)culture to historicize the radical mental health practices in the 1960s and 70s. I published another book (“[Strange Trips](https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Trips-Regulation-McGill-Queens-Associated/dp/0773556370)”) earlier this year that focuses on the contentious relationship between scientific knowledge, cultural assumptions, and social concerns. My hope — particularly with “Break On Through” — is to promote the discussion of mental health by placing the histories of American mental health, pharmaceutical use, and intoxicant use in dialogue with one another, all within the context of mainstream and fringe therapies.
 
Questions about the history of drugs or pharmaceuticals? The field of psychiatry in the 1960s and 70s? Over the past few years, I've written and taught about how and why we control and regulate drugs in CANADA and the US. And I've tried to understand the major swings and struggles in modern mental health care.  I’m here from 1 – 3 PM EST — ask me anything! (if you can’t make it then, you can find me on Twitter [@LucRichert](https://twitter.com/lucrichert) and [@drughistory](https://twitter.com/drughistory).)

Edit (1:15 pm): Dealing with a couple of technical difficulties but should be getting to your wonderful questions in a moment!"
