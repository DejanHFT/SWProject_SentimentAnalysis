Do any infectious diseases exploit immune checkpoints?,Telgin3125,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/12vev58/do_any_infectious_diseases_exploit_immune/,13,83,"We know that one way cancers can evade the immune system is through overexpression of immune checkpoints like PD-1/PD-L1.

Do we know if there are any infectious diseases that take advantage of this too?  It seems like viruses in particular would benefit from this, either coding for the checkpoint molecules directly or tricking the host cell into overexpressing them to tamp down immune responses."
