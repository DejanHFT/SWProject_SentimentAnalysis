"[UPDATE] Me [29F] with my husband [29M] been married less than a year, I'm pregnant and I thought he'd be more supportive",ngtastic,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/251unz/update_me_29f_with_my_husband_29m_been_married/,37,158,"[Link to original:](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22fufv/me_29f_with_my_husband_29m_been_married_less_than/)

So, to summarize, my husband was being a pretty big jerk when I was 7 weeks pregnant. I'm happy to announce he's made a complete change and he's super supportive now. I'm almost 12 weeks and my symptoms have eased up and I've felt much more like myself. Thank you for all the AMAZING advice, especially from those that have been through this and didn't just resort to name-calling. I ended up eating a lot of crackers, then telling him about the reddit post. He was pretty upset at first. But he took the comments to heart and realized how much he was sucking as a partner.

FYI He's NEVER been around babies or pregnant women in his life, none of our close friends have kids, and he's an only child. He really isn't a bad guy, just kind of clueless sometimes. Also, I'm a really independent person and we have always had sex regularly, so when I started needing more comfort and avoiding having sex with him, he was very confused. He ACTUALLY THOUGHT that nothing happens in the first trimester and I was just complaining about nothing! His impression of pregnancy was that the symptoms got worse as the bump gets bigger. ha! Pregnancy is just as mysterious as periods to many men, I suppose. I should have communicated it better. 

He had to Google an article written by a guy explaining the first trimester and then it FINALLY clicked for him that I wasn't faking it. Two books that really helped him were: ""Idiot's Guides: Pregnancy for Dads"" and ""Pregnancy Sucks for Men"". I also got the original ""Pregnancy Sucks"" book and it helped me feel a lot less crazy. It's a lot less scientific than ""What to Expect.."" and puts a more down-to-earth spin on the symptoms. 

Husband is working out of town currently, but he's been sending me pictures of pages he's been reading, and asking me random pregnancy questions because he's studying up on it. It's pretty sweet. Before he left he was giving me cocoa butter massages every night and bringing me snacks and meals. And if I felt sick, he knew it came in waves, so he let me feel what I felt. Then when I had a wave of feeling better, we'd go run errands or hang out. Much better communication and understanding. 

Thanks again everyone. Especially the moms who helped me with the symptoms, and the dads who have felt the same way as my husband. And thanks for the referrals to r/babybumps and other subs. We're finally enjoying this miracle instead of fighting about it. Ha!

**tl;dr**: My husband had to google ""first trimester"" and read some books about pregnancy, and now he's MUCH more informed and helpful with my pregnancy!"
