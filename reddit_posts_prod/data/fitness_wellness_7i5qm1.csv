Looking for a book that explains exercises well for a gym beginner,TheCursedTroll,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7i5qm1/looking_for_a_book_that_explains_exercises_well/,41,29,"Hey all, 

my brother started working out recently but has issued problems that he doesnt really knwo how to use all the stuff correctly, so I wanted to gift him a book for christmas.

Does anybody know decent books for gym beginners that explain exercises in detail and DO's and DON'T's? 

Preferable if it's available via amazon, but if not also shouldn't be a problem. 

Thanks guys! :D"
