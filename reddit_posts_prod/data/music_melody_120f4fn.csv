Can’t stop thinking of this songs melody!,Liamsyss,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/120f4fn/cant_stop_thinking_of_this_songs_melody/,5,0,"Basically the songs melody goes like this

“Bum, bum, bum. Lalalala” (higher pitch lalala)

And repeats for a bit and has a bit of soft rapping/singing over it. The melody sounds almost angelic and soft but still makes a beat. I’m willing to literally pay $5 to anyone who can correctly give me this song. I NEED TO KNOW"
