What's the most badass historical character nobody seems to know about?,buzzerbusy,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/ceou97/whats_the_most_badass_historical_character_nobody/,790,1829,"I'd say Bismarck. In his youth, he regularly had sword fights, all in all nearly two dozen and he was seen shooting the celling of a bar, followed by him freeing wild animals right there. 1848 he tried to make an 8 yo king and from 1863-1871 he just played with the European countries as if they were puppets, making France and Prussia, Austria and Prussia AND Denmark and Prussia have wars with each other to reach something, the country was trying to achieve for a long time, a united nation. Then he started messing with all the  other parties in the nation and the pope. The fucking pope. He also predicted nearly accurately, when Kaiser Wilhelm would lose his reign. 


Edit: Bismarck might not be as unknown as I thought, my bad.

Edit 2: Corrected some historical inaccuracies."
