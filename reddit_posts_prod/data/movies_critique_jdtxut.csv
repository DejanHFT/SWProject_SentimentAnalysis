[Spoilers] Has “Nightcrawler” (2014) aged out of its social critique?,littleapple88,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/jdtxut/spoilers_has_nightcrawler_2014_aged_out_of_its/,18,8,"I just watched Nightcrawler for the first time. Liked the movie, and thought Jake Gyllenhaal was fantastic. 

However after hearing about how impactful the social criticism of media and consumer culture was on audiences over the past few years or so, I must admit I was a bit underwhelmed when the credits rolled. 

Yes, Gyllenhaal was frighteningly sociopathic at times. But I was never really surprised or shocked at any of the actions the news people or Louis (save for the lie Louis told to Rick near the crashed car). The plot felt more like a truism to me rather than biting commentary. Of course the news station will pay more for these videos, this is simply how the operate, I thought. 

Have I become so desensitized to clickbait media now that the film kind of falls flat? It came out about 6 years ago. That’s a long time in terms of how media has evolved."
