Motivation problems.,kigid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1rl9py/motivation_problems/,18,1,"Ive been trying for years to get myself in shape and to build muscle like iv always wanted. the problem is that i don't have anything to give me a push. so to speak.

I've always been skinny, but not anorexic skinny so that i have had to watch my diet. My parents are fairly health wise and vegetarian to boot, so that led me to have a healthy childhood. which kept me fit enough as i needed to be. But now, going into my 19th year, I'm not nearly as fit as I *want* to be. I was never bullied, or given any reason to force myself to build up body mass. With me its always been brains over brawn, which is all well and good but id like to look better than i do and be able to accomplish more things.

fact is that I just cant seem to stay focused or care enough about it while im attempting to work out. I've tried lots of things including school and having friends coach me etc. but I always get stuck before I get to the point where I want to work out. It always seems like a chore that just leaves me tired and in pain afterwards. I don't like to go to gyms because frankly i feel like everyone's judging me. but i need something to get me going.

So, I'm wondering if there's like, a camp or program or something that people cn go to to get started. Like a several week program that makes you work out according to whatever level you're at, and also feeds you right etc. I feel like if I could just get past that point and actually feel this ""workout high"" that people talk about I could keep going. I do want to be fit."
