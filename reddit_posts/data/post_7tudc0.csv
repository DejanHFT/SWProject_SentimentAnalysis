We have two weeks left of the AskReddit 10th Anniversary T-shirt fundraiser. So far we have managed to raise **$1,421** for Doctors Without Borders thanks to 162 supporters from the community!! 

We wanted to remind you that you **can donate without purchasing a product** to support the cause. Just click on the [**Buy/Donate**](https://i.imgur.com/wO7YqYz.png) button and select [**Donate Only**](https://i.imgur.com/2Gm3WMT.png).

Another reminder, we also have 3 additional products featuring a different design:

[A Trucker Hat](https://www.customink.com/fundraising/ug-15160393914325817a) (We still need to sell 9 more to print)

[A Blanket](https://www.customink.com/fundraising/ug-15160388754460156b) (10 more needed to print)

and [A Tote Bag](https://www.customink.com/fundraising/askreddit-10th-anniversary-tote-bag) (4 more needed to print)

Lastly, we were able to get some advanced printings of the designs thanks to CustomInk, so if you're wondering how they will look printed here they are:

This fundraiser will be going on until February 12th, so you have until then to get one of these products or throw a couple of bucks towards a really good cause. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
