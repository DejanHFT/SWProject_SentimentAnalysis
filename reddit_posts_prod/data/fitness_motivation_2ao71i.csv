Losing motivation during my runs,PatronSaintofLogic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2ao71i/losing_motivation_during_my_runs/,42,17,"Hey Fittit. I've been a weightlifter for a few years, and this year I decided to take up running. Overall, I enjoy it, and I run about 2.5 miles a few times a week. My problem is that, lately, after mile 1 I lose almost all motivation to keep running.

My body will tell my brain *""stop, I hate this, no no no, I want to stop running right now.""* My brain will run the diagnostic check: how are my lungs? Holding steady. How are my legs? Still good to go. How is my body heat? Not at emergency levels.

It's just that my body does not want to keep running, and it takes a lot of discipline to keep pushing my potential even though physically I am not being held back. Often I give up and revert to walking for a stretch.

* I am not overweight, I am thin and athletic looking
* I am running on a relatively flat road surface
* I have no serious health problems
* I listen to music to keep myself pumped up

How can I push through this mental block and keep motivated to run?"
