What are some of the most historically ACCURATE movies?,HelloThatGuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1yejye/what_are_some_of_the_most_historically_accurate/,135,133,"So I saw the thread about most historically inaccurate movies. I wasn't really surprised by any of the responses (given Hollywood changes whatever it needs to make money) but there were a lot of movies mentioned. So I figure what the hell, ask the opposite question.

What are some movies based on historical events that stick fairly close to reality? "
