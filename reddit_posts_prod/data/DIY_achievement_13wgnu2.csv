Can I recompress swollen MDF with a little moisture and a LOT of pressure?,GoScienceEverything,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/13wgnu2/can_i_recompress_swollen_mdf_with_a_little/,14,0,"The problem is some laminate flooring in a rental apartment, swelling at the seams.

MDF is created by taking a wet pulp with binder (glue) and compressing it with heat to drive out the water. A quick Google suggests 400-700 PSI, which is 3-5 MPa or 30-50 kg/cm2.

My assumption is that water causes MDF to swell by temporarily softening the binder, allowing the strained fibers to decompress a bit. This sounds ""easily"" reversible.

***Assuming* I'm able to achieve the necessary pressure - e.g. heavy stuff on a strong table, table leg on the swelling, a few drops of water and a few days to dry - could I re-compress this MDF?**

I know that it would be hard to achieve the pressure, and that the water risks worsening the problem. I can figure out the engineering. What I don't know is the theory.

For example: would the original binder still harden/bind as it originally did, or would it be a good idea to mix in e.g. a bit of PVA to the water? (School glue while testing, perhaps waterproof wood glue if things are going well.)

Thanks for any advice, encouragement, and/or dissuasion! (And let me know if there's a better  sub for this.)"
