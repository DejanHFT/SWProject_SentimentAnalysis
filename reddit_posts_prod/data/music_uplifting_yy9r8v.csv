Need some uplifting music...,Immediate_Work_6652,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/yy9r8v/need_some_uplifting_music/,19,6,Really need some good recommendations for music that's not sad or about love. Been stuck in my head thinking about her and how it's over and all my music reminds me of her. Need to get myself out of this hole I'm in and I'm starting by finding some better music.
