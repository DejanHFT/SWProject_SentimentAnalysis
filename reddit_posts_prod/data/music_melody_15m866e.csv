Why is this melody so damn popular?,kometoru11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/15m866e/why_is_this_melody_so_damn_popular/,0,0,"I have links to a couple videos showing the same exact melody, and I’ve heard it so many times before.  It’s not so niche, but it’s even shown it’s way into South-East Asian media (don’t have links for these)

Please show me some more I may have missed, I hear one version at my Buddhist temple all the time but can’t seem to find it. I remember it’s an instrumental and has a blue album cover with Buddha on it. It’s also it Thai."
