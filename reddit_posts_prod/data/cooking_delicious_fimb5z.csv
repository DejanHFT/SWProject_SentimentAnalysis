"TIL Pecorino Romano has a really, really high melting point and doesn't look great atop smashed potatoes. Oh well, at least it was delicious....",believe0101,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/fimb5z/til_pecorino_romano_has_a_really_really_high/,124,1330,"Followed an easy recipe, ended up with this. Deliciously salty (there's minced garlic roasted and hidden in there too) but aesthetically not my best work hahaha.

Anybody else here making inordinately labor intensive potato dishes like HASSLEbacks (yes I misspelled that intentionally) because why not?

edit: this blew up! i typed up a [rough recipe here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/fimb5z/til_pecorino_romano_has_a_really_really_high/fkjj2w4/). you can also just google ""smashed potatoes"" and use any recipe like that. lots of good advice in these comments, thanks everyone!"
