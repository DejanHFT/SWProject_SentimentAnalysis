"For those of you who are close or have achieved your fitness goals, what were they and how long did it take you?",ANDTHEMETSWIN,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/28dkqp/for_those_of_you_who_are_close_or_have_achieved/,96,36,"I'm curious as to how long it takes different people to achieve their fitness goal.  I'm about 6 months in and I've tried to eat healthy and exercise at least 5 days a week.  I've lost about 20 pounds and 5-8% of my body fat but I'm still going.

I'd love to hear how long it took other people."
