Achievement unlocked:  100 pushups in 10 minutes :D,Greatdolanmite,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/j9f8t/achievement_unlocked_100_pushups_in_10_minutes_d/,85,63,"So a few years ago, before I got into fitness, a friend of mine told me about this challenge he had.  100 pushups in ten minutes.  I tried it at the time, but I could hardly get to thirty.  Then, I got into a lot of cardio about a year and a half ago, still wasn't able to do it.  Then, a couple months ago I came to /r/fitness and decided I was going to start doing some strength training.  A couple weeks ago I remembered the challenge and started working towards it.  Two days ago, I did it in 9:46.  To make sure it wasn't a fluke, I did it again today in 9:09.  20 lifepoints.

**TL;DR**  I couldn't do pushups before but now I can do 100 in under 10 minutes.  This was a milestone for me.

**Edit**:  Hey guys, I'm curious as to how others would do in this challenge (the only sources of successful completion I have are myself and one other friend).  Try it out and post your time!"
