End of year goal achieved: Double bodyweight squat! (xpost /r/xxfitness),rampagehanna,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2u06kg/end_of_year_goal_achieved_double_bodyweight_squat/,86,57,"http://youtu.be/xT2kHanzeSk

Height: 158 cm (5'2'') and about 50kg (110lbs).


Depth is a little questionable, could have been a tad lower and I actually did a second rep but the stupid phone storage was full so it didn't record it.


I started lifting at the end of September 2013. I instantly fell in love with it and Starting Strength will forever have a special place in my heart. My brother introduced me to it and I will never forget how I told him I didn't want to get bigger thighs and he sighted and said ""Well then stop adding more weight when you reach 40kg (88lbs)"". Ha!
My end of year goal for 2014 was hitting a double bodyweight squat and I first tried in on the second christmas day and I failed miserably. I couldn't even squat 95kg (209lbs) which I already managed one month prior. I was devastated.


But I didn't give up. On the 29th of December I went to the gym before work at 7am and boom I got my 100kg (220lbs) squat!


I think it is very important to set yourself a goal and try to reach it and even if you don't, it doesn't matter as long as you tried and gave everything you could! If you are interested in lifting but are somehow scared because of whatever reason, please do yourself a favor and just try it. If it is not your cup of tea, nothing lost, but it could change your life.


It gave me ambition, confidence and power because I know how much I'm capable of. 

Lifting made me a better person.


Routine:

I started with SS and stayed on it about 6 months and then switched to 5/3/1 but I didn't do well on the programming. 

I stopped and had the fuckarounditis for a few months (was cutting anyway) and started a bulk at the beginning of august. I switched to Madcow (squat and bench) and Magnusson for deads and I'm still on it. 
I actually started my cut at the beginning of december but upped to maintance one week before christmas to have enough energy for the lift.

Still on the cut and hating my life. "
