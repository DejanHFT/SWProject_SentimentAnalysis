Whats the best material to create harmonic melodies?,iideologii,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/18spejd/whats_the_best_material_to_create_harmonic/,10,0,I'm just wondering about if I was trying to use per-say rain to hit a piece of metal above a microphone to create some sort of melody what would be the best type of material for that? I was thinking a thin sheet of steel or maybe a thin type of glass?
