An Illustrated Guide to Fitness and Wellness - Illustrated by me!,Peachpunk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1o1jn6/an_illustrated_guide_to_fitness_and_wellness/,5,8,"My contributors and I have just submitted our guide to [Indie Gogo](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/health-axioms-card-deck), where you can get a good preview of some of the cards in the deck! I'm one of the two illustrators for the project, and I suppose the design lead as well, and I thought you guys might be interested in looking through what we have. 

We've been working our butts off over the past year to make the deck shine, and I really hope it can help inspire and educate folks to take better care of themselves and their families. If you feel like you could get behind some of the ideas in this deck, 

Even if you can't contribute, if you really like what we're working on, passing the word along would mean a lot to us. Also, if you have any questions or critique, please feel free!
