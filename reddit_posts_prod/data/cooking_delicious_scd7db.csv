"Butter beans (aka gigantes, mature lima beans) are freaking delicious.",TheBananaKing,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/scd7db/butter_beans_aka_gigantes_mature_lima_beans_are/,137,682,"Seriously they're amazing. I could eat them straight out of the can. 

Threw a bunch in some leftover salsa and baked them, and they were the best thing I've eaten in ages.

Cheap as hell, lots of protein, taste way better than any other canned bean out there - on par with *really good* homemade chickpeas, and surprisingly low in calories. 

I'm going to have to source some dried ones, because if they're this good canned, home cooked are going to be incredible. 


Get you some."
