The Most Delicious Egg I Have Ever Eaten. (Not a very healthy choice),ClintChenny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/2cd5nz/the_most_delicious_egg_i_have_ever_eaten_not_a/,132,724,"So I work at a very rich country club as a bartender. We have a very highly trained and highly skilled chef and occasionally he will toss me a recipe to try at home. 

On every salad he sends out (unless specifically asked not to) an ""egg crouton"" on top. 

The Egg Crouton is essentially a deep fried egg, but it's so much more than that.

-Bring some water to a boil and boil the egg for 5 minutes exactly. 
-After 5 minutes place egg directly in ice cold water.
-5 more minutes in the ice bath and remove the shell. 
-Once shell is removed, roll wet egg directly in flour.
-After the flour shower, dip in a bowl of yolk.
-After the flour and yolk, roll in some panko.
-Once you get it nice and coated deep fry that bish until browned.

Top a salad with this and the crunchy texture goes perfectly with the still runny yolk acting almost as another salad dressing.

It looks like a lot of work in list view, but I swear it's simple and DEE-LISH-US!

Try it!

EDIT: Thanks for the love guys. I didn't know what a scotch egg was until this. I'm going to have to try one of those. This is my first post here so I apologize if it wasn't detailed enough. I'll definitely post some other tips from Chef as I learn them. You don't have to read them if you don't want. Also, for some reason I thought photo posts were frowned upon. Whenever I get to work on Sunday, I'll ask Chef to plate one and let me take a picture of it.
