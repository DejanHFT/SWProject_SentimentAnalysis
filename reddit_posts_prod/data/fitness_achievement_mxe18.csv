What I have are not big secrets, but real life examples of perseverance and dedication. I would like to help educate others and possibly help to motivate/train others who want to achieve their own fitness goals. I made a New Years Resolution this year to significantly tone my upper body more and here are the results:

I can't tell you a thing about how to get big, because that hasn't been my goal, mostly for reasons of protecting my personal cardiovascular health, but I consider myself a master at achieving lean and toned.

This is totally sincere and I hope it doesn't get discredited and relegated to being down voted into oblivion. I truly, honestly want to help others that want to become more healthy and fit, because it has immeasurably improved my quality of life, and I want to help do that for others."
