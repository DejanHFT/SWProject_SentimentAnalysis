How to build a supportive base when you're depressed,throwawayy053092,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/jmq4ge/how_to_build_a_supportive_base_when_youre/,1,1,"I'm 28. I live mostly in isolation, even before covid. 

At my baseline/normal I am depressed, I have been for the last 17 or so years. I have to force myself to do things, motivation is something far and few between and it's hard to enjoy anything. I would choose to sleep to just make the days go by as I have no interest in life. When I get into a relationship, I've realized I become obsessed with my partner because they're the only person I have, and I hate that imbalance (as do they).

I'm in therapy, but I know I NEED positive humans in my life. Friends, mentors, etc, but with the depression + anxiety I've never been able to commit to building relationships with people.

I'll get on bumble bff, meetup, spend hours trying to find volunteering opportunities, etc and strike up some convos but even if I do end up meeting a potential friend I have to force myself to continue to want to see them.

I know I can't live like this if I ever want a balanced life with healthy relationships, what can I do? Anyone else in a similar position that has been successful with building a base?

Tldr depression makes forming relationships very difficult even though I know I need them. Those with depression, any advice?"
