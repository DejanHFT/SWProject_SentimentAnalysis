Children whose parents had extreme historical impact?,LalaDesse,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/bl7upt/children_whose_parents_had_extreme_historical/,49,51,"I was reading about Cleopatra and found out she had a son with Julius Caesar, called Caesarion. Unfortunately Caesarion was killed while still a teenager it is believed. Little is known about Ceaserion, but it cannot be easy being a child of people with that amount of power, fame and historical impact. This made me wonder if there has ever been children born from parents who both had power/fame/historical impact of the same level or higher as Cleopatra and Julius Caesar?

Edit: Really interested in examples were **both** parents had fame/power/historical impact, which was created mostly **individually** from eachother, like for example Cleopatra and Caesar :)

Edit2: Would really appreciate if people who downvote my comments, would comment on them as well. All I want is to learn if I'm wrong, I don't care about karma and can't learn from being downvoted"
