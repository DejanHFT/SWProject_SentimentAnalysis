"AskScience AMA Series: Hi! We are Stephanie Walton and Whit Pepper, scientist and chief commercial officer of clean-air company ATMOFIZER with patented technology designed to reduce indoor ultra-fine particles and deactivate airborne viruses/bacteria without using a filter.

As the fear of airborne illnesses has heightened, people have understandably become much more concerned about potentially contagious strangers and are choosing to go where high air quality standards are maintained. Conventional approaches have been focused on making filters tighter, but filter media can only be made so small before becoming difficult to move air effectively or efficiently. Reducing nanoparticles by agglomerating them into larger, aggregated clusters is the key. Larger particles are more easily mitigated and fall to the ground more quickly. [Atmofizer](https://atmofizer.com/) is leading 4th generation in air technology, with patented agglomeration tech using acoustic pressure waves to reduce airborne nanoscopic particles-without using filters and saving our landfills! Another benefit we hear is the reduction of odors, including strong smoke odors like cannabis. Cleaner air apparently smells a lot better too!

We are the scientists behind Atmofizer, ask us anything!
