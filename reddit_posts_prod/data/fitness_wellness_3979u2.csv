What do you guys think of Nutrition and Wellness coaching?,Crazigloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3979u2/what_do_you_guys_think_of_nutrition_and_wellness/,6,0,"Hello everyone.

I was recently referred to a ""nutrition and wellness coach"" by a friend. I never heard of this kind of coaching before outside of gym trainers, actual nutrionists, etc. The appointment/evaluation is essentially free, but you refer 10 people to help keep them going. 

So my appointment begins with a series of basic tests; it turns out I'm 6'1'' and 158 lbs. I'm a 25 year old male of small frame, 41% muscle, 16% fat, 3% visceral fat, and apparently my metabolic age is 30 years old. The last fact surprised me, since my scores were considered normal, everything considered. I asked my coach why this was, and she told me the machine I used to weigh myself helped determine it through calculations( it was like scale + a handlebar that you hold as if bycicling ).

[I'm then introduced to the company my coach is representing](http://www.herbalifeww.com/ca/ ), along with their philosophy and goals. It was very basic, straightforward stuff aimed at sensitizing you to facts about the decline in physical heath amongst North Americans. As my personal evaluation unfolds, I'm offered various drinks/shakes from this Herbal Life brand. The shake was delicious. [Here's the nutrional facts if anyone was curious].(http://az31823.vo.msecnd.net/content/en-us/pdf/catalog/3110_formula1_cookiesncream_label_us.pdf)

I learned quite a bit about my lifestyle and about factors that contributed to fatigue/lack of gym gains, etc, so there was value I derived. 

Here's my question for you guys:

* How legit is this whole thing? Should I even worry about this being scammy?
* concerning my metabolic age, i'm a bit skeptical about my score. Can anyone confirm it's actually 30? Or is the value exaggerated to possibly scare me into wanting to change myself?

* Meal replacements. The program I was offered consisted of a months-worth of that shake I had for roughly 150$, along with tailored coaching and whatnot. There's nothing I can buy outside their product. 

* Is there a better meal replacement out there for weight gaining? Is the price offered reasonable?
