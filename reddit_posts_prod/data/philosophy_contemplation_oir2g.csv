How does one reconcile the immense grandeur of life with the monotony and deafening banality of reality?,jrh1984,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/oir2g/how_does_one_reconcile_the_immense_grandeur_of/,20,17,"I was thoroughly engrossed in thought on the train this morning, reading about [quantum entangled particles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabric_of_the_Cosmos). When I looked up, I saw herds of people silently filing through turnstiles, most on the way to work. And the juxtaposition hit me like a ton of Nietzsche's [bricks](http://quotationsbook.com/quote/30273/).

{EDIT} I'm not saying ""life is boring"" at all. We know it's *anything* but boring. I spend a lot of time reading/contemplating life's complexities. Yet (I for) one can't escape the stark contrast between the ""reality"" of daily life, the humdrum, the eating/sleeping/shitting routine; with these complexities. 

For example, right now: 1-dimensional slices of 2-dimensional membranes are vibrating in an 11-dimensional spacetime, some of which form different ""coloured"" quarks, obeying specific forces to bind in specific groups, forming an atom, of which a collection form various chemical combinations, shaped into various organelles deep inside cells, each with separate duties, forming different organs, all part of different bodily systems, one of which is the most complex molecule in the universe, with which *I* can consciously comprehend and ponder the fact that this is what constructs ""me"". Yet here I am typing at a computer in my underwear.

How does one philosophically reconcile such a disparity?"
