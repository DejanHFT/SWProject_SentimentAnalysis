AskScience AMA Series: I'm a psychologist/neuroscientist studying and teaching about social media and adolescent brain development. AMA!,AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/q3vf3x/askscience_ama_series_im_a/,206,2130,"A whistleblower recently exposed that Facebook knew their products could harm teens' mental health, but academic researchers have been studying social media's effects on adolescents for years. I am a Teaching Assistant Professor in Psychology and Neuroscience at UNC-Chapel Hill, where I teach an undergrad course on ""Social media, technology, and the adolescent brain"". I am also the outreach coordinator for the [WiFi Initiative in Technology and Adolescent Brain Development](https://www.wifi-initiative.org/), with a mission to study adolescents' technology use and its effects on their brain development, social relationships, and health-risk behaviors. I engage in scientific outreach on this important topic through our [Teens & Tech](https://teensandtech.org/) website - and now here on r/AskScience! I'll see you all at 2 PM (ET, 18 UT), AMA!
