**Reviews**

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-little-mermaid-review-halle-bailey-melissa-mccarthy-1235484161/):

>A ho-hum adaptation buoyed by a lovely lead turn.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2023/05/the-little-mermaid-review-rob-marshalls-live-action-take-disney-animated-classic-1235368418/):

>Marshall has made a movie with all the magic required to pull it off and, if not replace the original in our hearts, at least has made a movie that can stand next to that one to also become a memorable part of our cinematic world.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/the-little-mermaid-review-halle-bailey-melissa-mccarthy-1235620560/):

>Halle Bailey is all the reason that any audience should need to justify Disney revisiting this classic.

[Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-little-mermaid-review-halle-bailey/) (A-):

>With Halle Bailey, life under the sea is better than anything Disney live-action has done in nearly a decade.

[Indiewire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-little-mermaid-review-2023-live-action-1234864226/) (C-):

>For now, “The Little Mermaid” exists outside of the very world it so wants to be a part of, one already so lovingly rendered in its predecessor, “real” or not.

[Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/22/the-little-mermaid-review-ariel-disney-halle-bailey) (2/5):

>Bailey is both the finished film’s only unmitigated triumph and the best argument for this whole live action remake enterprise in one shimmering mermaidcore package.

[Independent (UK)](https://www.slashfilm.com/1292418/the-little-mermaid-review/) (2/5):

>There’s a real stink of obligation to everything that exists around Bailey and her star-making turn.

[Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/little-mermaid-halle-movie-review-0c1f706c41049400684c4c7bbaa51594) (2/4):

>For all its pizazz, everything about this Little Mermaid is just more muted. Miranda’s new songs are odd, too, and don’t seem to fit.

[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/05/22/the-little-mermaid-movie-review-halle-bailey-disney-remake/70239548007/) (2.5/4):

>While not everything goes swimmingly, Halle Bailey splendidly buoys this ""Mermaid"" as the naive underwater youngster with dreams of exploring the surface.

[AV Club](https://www.avclub.com/the-little-mermaid-remake-film-review-1850444615) (C+):

>Its most iconic moments are borrowed and copied wholesale, serving as little more than a reminder of simpler days watching clamshell VHS tapes released from the Disney Vault. Maybe that’s enough for some people. But maybe, like Ariel, we should want more.

[Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/reviews/article-disneys-the-little-mermaid-remake-proves-life-isnt-better-down-where/):

>A thoroughly pointless cash grab of a thing, this new Little Mermaid is one of the most uninspired films to slither out of Disney since the company started raiding its own vault...

[Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/the-little-mermaid-review-2023)

>As The Little Mermaid crawls by at a snail's pace, the wondrous moments are weighed down by wasted opportunities for spectacle, emotion, and unapologetic bombast.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-little-mermaid/) (3/5):

>Another ‘live-action’ remake that’s darker and less compelling than the animated original, but it’s saved by Bailey’s charming performance, McCarthy’s sass and the story’s own eternal magic.

[Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/2023/05/what-happened-to-the-frothy-pleasure-of-the-little-mermaid.html):

>As the studio has done with other live-action remakes, Disney betrays its own lack of imagination and an essential misreading of what made its original children’s fare such a joy to audiences in the first place.

[Observer](https://observer.com/2023/05/the-little-mermaid-review-one-of-disneys-best-live-action-reimaginings/) (3/4):

>The Little Mermaid, despite a few misfires, is one of Disney’s best live-action reimaginings to date.

[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2023/05/22/little-mermaid-review-another-magic-free-live-action-disney-remake/) (2/4):

>Despite real actors, CGI and brand new material, “Mermaid” is the studio’s latest flesh-and-blood cash grab that’s more lifeless than far better two-dimensional painted drawings.

[Inverse](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/the-little-mermaid-review-revisionist-alt-history):

>The Little Mermaid is arguably the best live-action Disney remake since Kenneth Branagh’s Cinderella. The splendor is there; the romance is crafted with care — but something’s still missing.

[Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2023-05-22/little-mermaid-review-disney-halle-bailey-melissa-mccarthy):

>What’s on-screen too often feels like wan, second-rate imitation, and the few differences seem motivated less by a spirit of imagination than one of joyless anxiety.

[Slashfilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1292418/the-little-mermaid-review/) (7.5/10):

>""The Little Mermaid"" is a live-action remake done well.

[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/the-little-mermaid-review/):

>Led by a pitch-perfect Halle Bailey, The Little Mermaid is bolstered by deeper characterization and a grand scope, even as it grapples with flaws.

[Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/23730300/the-little-mermaid-live-action-halle-bailey-ariel-eric):

>What makes The Little Mermaid isn’t whether the fish look good, or what exactly fuels Triton and Ursula’s feud. It all comes back to Ariel and her journey, which is fueled by the central romance between her and Eric.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-little-mermaid-review) (7/10):

>What works best are the elements it takes from the original... While this version doesn’t always find its sea legs, there’s enough of those original ideas recreated here that it can’t go too far wrong.

[San Francisco Chronicle](https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/movies-tv/disney-little-mermaid-live-action-halle-bailey-18103246) (2/4):

>“The Little Mermaid” origin story lacks room for this more feminist take. It simply is not deep enough.

[Vox](https://www.vox.com/culture/23730350/little-mermaid-remake-review-halle-bailey-visuals):

>The remake’s main sin... is that it’s visually confusing, if not altogether aesthetically unappealing.

[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/22/entertainment/the-little-mermaid-review/index.html)

>Thanks largely to star Halle Bailey, the lavish musical holds up nicely under the weight of those expectations, preserving the original’s essence while updating undernourished aspects of it and riding a warm, hard-to-resist wave of nostalgia.

**Synopsis**:

>“The Little Mermaid” is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton’s daughters and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy.
