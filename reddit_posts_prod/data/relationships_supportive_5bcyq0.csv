I (28F) hate my best friend's (29F) boyfriend (26M). How do I force myself to be supportive and not allow my friendship to suffer?,yourboyfriendisajerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5bcyq0/i_28f_hate_my_best_friends_29f_boyfriend_26m_how/,54,214,"I'll call my best friend Leslie for this post. We've been best friends for five years and we truly do not judge and always support each other. 

I really, really don't like Leslie's boyfriend. They've been together a few months months now. I'll call him David. David is... a jerk. He may or may not have cheated on her with his ex (long story but he acted sketchy: I think he cheated, she believes him that he didn't), he's SUPER RACIST, and he's immature, arrogant, etc. I think he has a weird hold on Leslie, but he isn't abusive. 

At the same time, Leslie knows how I feel about David. She knows I dislike how he treats her. She knows I think he's sort of dickish. I don't give her these opinions unsolicited or frequently- only in the times that they've broken up, and she knows I dislike him in a way that best friends just know. 

It's been my experience and observations that, when someone dislikes their friend's significant other, the friendship suffers. Tremendously. 

I would never try to convince Leslie to leave David and I would never share my bad feelings about him unless she truly asked. I am supportive but it feels... fake. Like ""oh yay he got you flowers!"" When really I'm rolling my eyes and thinking he only got her favorite color roses because he fucked up again last night. 

My question isn't about wanting to get Leslie to leave her guy. I wouldn't, unless I felt her safety was in danger, and it's not. My question is though, how can I make myself suck up my hate for David's arrogance and racism and support Leslie? How can I make sure my friendship with Leslie doesn't suffer?

**TL;DR: my BFF's boyfriend is a world class jerk - may have cheated, racist, generally dickish. I don't want my friendship with my BFF to diminish. How can I be supportive without feeling fake? How do I suck it up? Is there a way to make myself not dislike him?**
