Help me find some recipes/techniques for easy yet delicious sides.,Pocket_Dave,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/12aq3bj/help_me_find_some_recipestechniques_for_easy_yet/,19,1,"I'm just getting into cooking, and I'm loving all the recipes out there for main dishes that make my mouth happy. But it seems like so many of the recipes I come across for sides are a bit more complicated/lengthy than I currently want to devote myself to when I'm putting so much of my attention & energy into the main dish.

However, I'd love to have an assortment of options that are at least a step above ""steam a bag of veggies in the microwave and add some salt"".

So I guess what I'm looking for are middle-of-the-road options? Some easy ways to add some sides to my plates that are a bit more exciting without having to use 10 ingredients and actively be preparing/cooking for 30+ mins."
