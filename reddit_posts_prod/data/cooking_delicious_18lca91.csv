Easy and delicious potato side dish for Christmas?,fred_burkle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/18lca91/easy_and_delicious_potato_side_dish_for_christmas/,14,5,"So I am currently recovering from some injuries after being in a car accident, I'm doing okay but not at 100% yet. I usually make a fancy potato gratin for Christmas, but I'm not sure I'm up for peeling potatoes or slicing them super thinly (don't have a mandoline). I don't have to bring anything this year, my family is certainly understanding, but I love to cook and would hate to miss out! What are your favorite special and delicious potato recipes that don't involve a ton of peeling/chopping/other labor intensive techniques? Thank you!"
