Protein Castles.,cool_spool_of_wool,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1yxfrq/protein_castles/,139,933,"I don't know if many others do this but I always try to make protein castles on top of my shakes. Firstly there's milk with a flat layer of protein powder, which forms the base, and then another scoop on top in the shape of the scooper (a little castle). It feels like a real achievement when you get the perfect castle... and then moments later there's a giant earthquake caused by the hands of a giant.
