As a dance company, we can appreciate the executive decision to take this energetic record completely left field and showcase dancers from across the world having fun with their craft. I know a lot of people are were probably expecting to see some glimpse of Beyoncé in this video as her presence is always breathtaking, however, I think it was a great switch up. Not only did were upcoming dancers featured in this video from across the world, it influenced hope and inspiration amongst thousands (on the low end) of dancers that opportunity is just around the corner.

USA Today says, ""While other [stars tweet out embarrassing photos of themselves](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PuberMe&src=tyah) to help raise awareness for hurricane relief, Beyoncé is donating money in a much hipper way; via a new remix...
...Beyonce [wrote on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZmx_nbH4BT/?taken-by=beyonce) that she's donating the ""proceeds from this song to hurricane relief charities for Puerto Rico, Mexico and the other affected Caribbean islands."" She also has [a website](http://beyonce.com/reliefefforts) detailing more relief efforts.

What Beyoncé and the originators of this record, J Balvin and Willy William have joined forces to do is breathtaking and I applaud them to the max! Does is the video the best quality in the world? No. But, quality is subjective. The quality of the meaning behind the video and its ultimate purpose is much more powerful than what we are programmed to believe what quality turely is. 

&nbsp;

Furthermore, SHE SUNG IT IN SPANISH!!! If I didn't know what dedication meant, I do today! The effort they guys put into this project is monumental.
