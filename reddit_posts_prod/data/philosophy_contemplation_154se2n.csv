My first attempt at Philosophical Writing: Unpacking the First Meditation,sage_of_majic,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/154se2n/my_first_attempt_at_philosophical_writing/,8,7,"**Preface**

Years ago I completed the Introduction to Philosophy course offered by the University of London International Program. While I enjoyed the course immensely, the financial cost made it difficult to continue formal studies. However, since then I've been slowly making my way through the recommended reading list that was provided at the back of my textbook and I am almost finished reading the entire list. In an attempt to broaden my understanding, I wanted to attempt to draft a formal piece of philosophical writing. The essay below is the result.

&#x200B;

**I. Introduction**

René Descartes, the esteemed French philosopher and mathematician, is widely recognized as a pivotal figure who connected the philosophical ideologies of the Medieval era to the onset of the modern age. Born in 1596, Descartes played an instrumental role in the Scientific Revolution and is particularly lauded for his substantial contributions to epistemology, the facet of philosophy that scrutinizes the essence and boundaries of human knowledge. Alongside his philosophical insights, Descartes' innovations in mathematics were transformative, particularly his foundational work in analytical geometry, which later catalyzed the development of calculus.

Among Descartes' influential philosophical oeuvre is the ""Meditations on First Philosophy,"" first circulated in 1641. In this seminal work, Descartes embarked on a journey to uncover the basis of certain knowledge, free from the confines of doubt. Comprising six reflective sections, this essay will concentrate specifically on the First Meditation, fittingly titled ""What can be called into doubt."" Herein, Descartes plots a pathway of radical skepticism, resolving to question all his prior convictions to determine which ones withstand the scrutiny of absolute certainty.

The crux of this essay hinges on the proposition that, within his First Meditation, Descartes strives to demonstrate the validity of questioning everything one believes. Descartes achieves this through a systematic regimen of radical doubt and by scrutinizing the dependability of sense perception, the potential for deception, and the verity of an external world's existence. Through a thorough dissection of Descartes' arguments, we will delve into how he inaugurated a fresh epoch of philosophical investigation that persists in its relevance within contemporary philosophical discourse and scientific exploration.

**II. Historical Context**

To fully appreciate the profound implications of Descartes’ First Meditation, one must first comprehend the historical milieu in which his ideas were born. The 16th and 17th centuries marked a monumental period of intellectual metamorphosis, an epoch known as the Scientific Revolution. This era, characterized by exceptional advancements in diverse domains such as astronomy, physics, biology, and chemistry restructured humanity's understanding of the natural world. Intellectual titans like Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler challenged conventional Aristotelian and Ptolemaic perspectives, initiating a fresh scientific method that prioritized observation, experimentation, and mathematical scrutiny.

Far from being impervious to the intellectual seismic shifts instigated by the Scientific Revolution, philosophy found itself in a state of flux. Philosophers grappled with innovative scientific revelations that often clashed with long-standing philosophical and theological tenets.

Preceding the Scientific Revolution, the prevailing intellectual tradition in Europe was Scholasticism. This paradigm was notable for its deep entrenchment in Aristotelian philosophy and its endeavors to harmonize this with Christian theology. However, the onslaught of scientific discoveries that undermined the Aristotelian worldview precipitated a radical change. Philosophers began to interrogate the Scholastic approach, sparking the creation of epistemological frameworks that were more congruent with the burgeoning scientific evidence.

Descartes was a prime mover in this intellectual revolution. Instead of leaning heavily on tradition and authority, he sought a foundation for knowledge rooted in reason and evidence. Thus, he adopted a resolutely skeptical stance, casting doubt on the credibility of all knowledge sources susceptible to doubt.

For Descartes, skepticism was not an end unto itself, but a means to a far loftier objective. His paramount ambition was to establish a firm bedrock for scientific knowledge, one impervious to the types of doubt that could be levelled against Scholasticism and sensory-based empiricism. Descartes was convinced that if such a foundation were to be established, it would equip science and philosophy with the tools required to secure true understanding and make substantive progress.

In this broader context, Descartes’ First Meditation can be interpreted as the initial phase of this audacious undertaking. Through the process of radical doubt, Descartes aimed to dismantle the shaky scaffolding upon which prior knowledge systems were erected, making way for a more robust, unassailable foundation for scientific and philosophical inquiry. In the forthcoming sections, we will scrutinize the precise arguments Descartes used to propel his doubt campaign.

**III. Descartes' Method of Doubt**

Methodological skepticism is a systematic process of doubting the truth or reliability of various beliefs and claims. Unlike general skepticism, which might lead to the denial of the possibility of knowledge, methodological skepticism is employed as a tool within philosophical inquiry. It is a purposeful, temporary state of doubt which philosophers, like scientists, use to scrutinize and evaluate the foundations of their beliefs critically.

By doubting, one can distinguish between beliefs that are resilient and can withstand scrutiny and those that are not. In this way, methodological skepticism serves as an intellectual house-cleaning, enabling philosophers to rid themselves of untenable beliefs and establish a firmer foundation for knowledge.

Descartes used methodological skepticism as a means to achieve his philosophical ends. In the First Meditation, he undertook an unprecedented level of skepticism where he resolved to subject all his beliefs to doubt. He was searching for absolute certainty, for something that could serve as the foundational rock upon which reliable knowledge could be built. His method involved discarding any belief that could possibly be doubted, in hopes that what remained would be entirely indubitable.

Descartes thought that if he could find even a single piece of knowledge that was absolutely certain, it could serve as the foundation for a complete system of knowledge. His famous assertion, ""Cogito, ergo sum"" (""I think, therefore I am""), later appearing in the Second Meditation, is often cited as an example of the certainty he was seeking.

While Descartes does not explicitly use the term 'tabula rasa' in the Meditations, his approach is akin to wiping the slate clean in order to build knowledge afresh. The concept of 'tabula rasa', or blank slate, is that the mind starts as a blank canvas and that knowledge is added through experience and perception.

Descartes' method of doubt can be seen as an attempt to reach this state of 'tabula rasa' deliberately by shedding off preconceived notions and beliefs. By doubting everything, he aimed to arrive at a point where the mind is free from any prior assumptions. He envisioned rebuilding knowledge from this point, basing it only on beliefs that are absolutely certain.

As we move on, it is essential to analyze the specific arguments Descartes employed in his First Meditation to execute this radical skepticism, beginning with his arguments on the unreliability of sensory perception.

**IV. Sensory Perception as Unreliable**

In the First Meditation, one of the earliest routes that Descartes navigates in his systematic doubt is the trustworthiness of the senses. Traditionally, humans have turned to sensory perception as the principal conduit of information about the external world. Nonetheless, Descartes contends that the senses are not invariably reliable and can, at times, mislead us. If our senses have betrayed us even once, he maintains, it is judicious to deem them unreliable, and hence, unfit as foundational stones for certain knowledge.

Moreover, he postulates that our senses frequently proffer perceptions that are ambiguous and indistinct. Since we cannot perpetually ascertain the truth through our senses, Descartes argues for the necessity of rejecting them as flawless arbiters of reality.

Descartes substantiates his assertion about the unreliability of the senses by introducing practical examples. He discusses optical illusions, such as a stick appearing bent when partially submerged in water, or a square tower seeming round from a distance. These scenarios demonstrate our senses' capacity for delivering deceptive information. Descartes infers that if our senses can falter in such instances, it is reasonable to approach them with a general skepticism.

One of Descartes’ most evocative propositions questioning the reliability of sensory perception is his dream argument. He postulates: How can we verify that our current experiences aren't merely part of a dream? In dreams, we frequently encounter scenarios and perceptions that are indistinguishable from waking life. Given our propensity to accept these dream experiences as reality, Descartes posits that we lack an irrefutable method for distinguishing dream experiences from waking ones based solely on sensory perceptions.

The dream argument is a pivotal element as it contests the demarcation between imagination and perception. If we cannot establish with certainty whether our current experiences are genuine perceptions or mere figments of our mind within a dream, then, Descartes concludes, we must withhold judgment on the reliability of our senses.

By unmasking the fallibility of sensory perception via these arguments, Descartes casts a shadow of doubt over a significant conduit for knowledge acquisition. This paves the way for his more radical propositions regarding the existence of a deceiving God and a malevolent demon, further bolstering his skeptical stance.

**V. The Deceiving God Argument**

Having questioned the dependability of the senses, Descartes advances to entertain a more radical notion of deception. He broaches the hypothesis that an immensely powerful being might manipulate our thoughts and perceptions to such a degree that none of our beliefs ring true. This omnipotent entity could be God, or something resembling God in terms of power and deceitfulness.

Descartes wields this hypothesis to propel his method of doubt further. By entertaining the potential existence of a potent deceiver, he can cast doubt not only on empirical knowledge gleaned through the senses but also on the rational underpinnings of knowledge.

Descartes contemplates the traditional concept of God as an omnipotent and benevolent being. He then ponders whether this all-powerful God could have fashioned us in a manner that leaves us systematically deceived in everything we believe. This notion is disconcerting, as it implies that even the ideas we deem most certain, such as elementary mathematical truths, could be illusory.

However, Descartes concedes that such systemic deception seems at odds with God’s inherent goodness. As a result, he refines the hypothesis and imagines not God, but a malevolent genius or demon possessing the same omnipotence but devoid of benevolence, who exhausts all its energies to deceive.

The malicious demon hypothesis represents the zenith of Descartes’ methodological skepticism. Under this hypothesis, every belief is under siege, since the demon could delude us about anything. This includes not just the evidence of our senses but also the axioms of mathematics and logic. Thus, this leaves Descartes devoid of anything he can be confident about, at least at this juncture in his meditations.

While the malicious demon hypothesis is immensely radical and seemingly fantastical, it serves a crucial role in Descartes’ philosophical endeavor. It enables him to level the field completely, to recognize that if even a single belief can withstand this degree of skepticism, it must be absolutely certain and indubitable.

This severe form of skepticism, embodied by the malicious demon, lays the groundwork for Descartes’ later exploration in the later Meditations, wherein he strives to reconstruct the edifice of knowledge upon more robust foundations. Yet, before we transition to Descartes' reconstruction project, it is imperative to scrutinize his skepticism regarding the existence of an external world and its interplay with his arguments on sense perception and the deceiving God.

**VI. Doubting the Existence of an External World**

Having expressed doubts about the reliability of the senses and the possibility of a powerful deceiver, Descartes shifts his focus to the external world. He argues that our unreliable senses, potentially under the sway of a deceiver, provide strong grounds to question the existence of the external world. Descartes posits that all our beliefs about the external world stem from sensory experiences. However, given these experiences are fallible and susceptible to deceit, it is questionable whether they truly reflect any external reality.

Drawing on the deceiving God or malicious demon hypothesis, Descartes contemplates that our experiences of the external world might not correspond to any actual reality. He proposes it is possible that there is no earth, no sky, no bodies – and yet, we could still have the very same experiences and sensations as if they did exist.

This line of reasoning aligns with what is known in contemporary philosophy as the brain-in-a-vat hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that, for all we know, we could merely be brains in vats, with all our experiences being generated by a supercomputer, analogous to Descartes’ malicious demon. The disturbing implication of this hypothesis is that our entire experience of an external world could be an elaborate illusion, with no foundation in reality.

Descartes' skepticism about the external world lays the groundwork for his later exploration of the mind-body distinction. By doubting the existence of the material world, he is left only with his thoughts and his capacity to doubt, which seems indubitable. This leads him, in later Meditations, to assert the existence of the self as a thinking thing, distinct from the body and the material world.

Descartes' skepticism regarding the material world is not intended to conclude that the external world does not exist. Instead, it serves as a radical exercise in doubt, enabling him to identify what can be known with absolute certainty. It is in this context that Descartes will ultimately formulate his famous cogito, ""I think, therefore I am,"" as the bedrock upon which knowledge can be rebuilt.

In the ensuing sections, one could explore how Descartes transitions from this stage of extreme skepticism to the reconstruction of knowledge, the affirmation of the existence of the self, and ultimately the acknowledgment of an external world and a benevolent God. However, these aspects exceed the scope of the current essay, which focuses on Descartes' attempts in the First Meditation to underscore the reasons to doubt everything one believes.

**VII. Implications and Responses**

Descartes' First Meditation and the radical doubt it posits have profound implications for the field of epistemology, the philosophical study of knowledge. By challenging the foundations of knowledge, Descartes opened up new pathways of exploration into the nature of certainty and the origins of knowledge.

One immediate outcome of Descartes' radical doubt is the realization of the uncertainty of much of what we consider to be knowledge. If sensory perceptions can't be trusted, and if there's even a remote possibility of a deceptive entity manipulating our thoughts, then the certainty of knowledge becomes elusive.

This radical doubt also illuminates the necessity of a firm foundation for knowledge. If knowledge is to be reliable, it must be built upon something that cannot be doubted. This search for a solid foundation led Descartes and later philosophers to examine the sources and boundaries of human knowledge with increased scrutiny.

Descartes' First Meditation has elicited a multitude of responses from philosophers. Some have adopted elements of his skepticism, while others have sought to refute it.

Foundationalism: Descartes himself is often associated with foundationalism, the belief that knowledge must be based on a foundation of certain, self-evident principles. In later Meditations, Descartes attempts to establish certain knowledge (for example, the existence of the self) as the basis for all human knowledge.

Empiricism: Unlike Descartes’ rationalist tendencies, empiricists like John Locke and David Hume argued that knowledge primarily originates from sensory experience. They were generally more optimistic than Descartes about the reliability of the senses, although Hume himself pushed skepticism to new extremes in relation to causation and induction.

Critiques of Descartes' skepticism: Some philosophers have argued that Descartes' skepticism is either self-defeating or excessive. For instance, G.E. Moore famously raised his hand and claimed he could know there was an external world simply by seeing his hand – a move now known as Moore's hands argument.

Following the radical skepticism of the First Meditation, Descartes embarks on a philosophical journey in the later Meditations to reconstruct knowledge. In the Second Meditation, he discovers a piece of certain knowledge, ""Cogito, ergo sum"" - ""I think, therefore I am."" Descartes posits that the very act of doubting one's existence serves paradoxically as proof of one's existence.

From this point, Descartes attempts to construct a system of knowledge. He makes a case for the existence of a benevolent God, whose goodness would prevent constant deception, and then uses this to re-establish the possibility of knowledge about the external world.

Descartes' Meditations, beginning with the radical doubt of the First Meditation, have had a lasting impact on philosophy, particularly epistemology, and continue to pose questions and provoke debates that engage philosophers to this day.

**VIII. Conclusion**

In the First Meditation, René Descartes embarked on an ambitious endeavor to interrogate the foundations of human knowledge. By employing a method of radical doubt, he scrutinized the trustworthiness of sensory perception, entertained the hypothesis of a powerful deceiver, and cast doubt on the existence of the external world. Together, these lines of thought create a landscape of skepticism in which every belief one holds is liable to doubt.

Descartes' radical skepticism has had a deep and enduring influence on modern philosophy and science. His daring approach in the First Meditation acted as a catalyst for the evolution of modern philosophy, moving it away from Scholasticism toward a more empirical and critical examination of the nature of knowledge. Descartes is frequently acknowledged as a key figure in the development of the modern scientific method because his skepticism necessitated that claims to knowledge be rigorously tested and based on clear and distinct principles.

Moreover, Descartes' skepticism continues to resonate in contemporary discussions in epistemology, the philosophy of mind, and even scientific inquiries into the nature of consciousness and reality. His 'cogito' laid the groundwork for a rich exploration of the nature of the self and consciousness, while his skepticism about the external world foreshadowed later philosophical challenges and thought experiments, such as the ""brain-in-a-vat"" hypothesis.

Reflecting on Descartes' First Meditation, we see the necessity of a delicate balance between skepticism and the pursuit of certainty in philosophical inquiry. While skepticism serves as a crucial tool to dispel dogmatism and unexamined beliefs, unchecked skepticism could potentially lead to a deadlock where no knowledge is possible. Descartes' own journey through the Meditations exemplifies this tension. Through radical doubt, he sought to clear the ground, but his later endeavor was to carefully construct the foundations for certain knowledge.

Descartes' First Meditation stands not only as a testament to the courageous spirit of philosophical inquiry but also as a reminder of the timeless tensions that define the human quest for understanding. In an era where information is plentiful, and certainty is elusive, Descartes invites us to critically examine our beliefs while maintaining the conviction that through reason and reflection, a measure of certainty and insight can be achieved."
