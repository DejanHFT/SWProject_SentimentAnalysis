My ring broke and I need creative advice,anonymous_p3arl,https://i.redd.it/yrjdab24ig7c1.png,8,2,"I don't know if anyone will see this, but I had a nice ring I really liked. It snapped in half and I lost the other half, the ring means a lot and I wanna do something creative that i can wear with the only half I have but idk what to make it into. Anyone got super creative ideas?"
