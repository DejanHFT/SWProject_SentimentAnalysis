How do you deal with inspiration suddenly flitting away?,Greathollow6008,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/11761oj/how_do_you_deal_with_inspiration_suddenly/,8,2,"Thus happens to me too many times. I think of a pretty nice idea I like, or some scene or concept that seems novel to me. 
Then by some external or internal thing, I get robbed of this inspiration. Somebody might call me, I might suddenly recieve a phone call, or maybe I'm in the middle of class(which is usually astrophysics, as it's when inspiration strikes most). I can remember hundreds of situations like that.
What do you guys do when inspiration slowly fades away from your brain?"
