"What's a flavor combination you were skeptical about, but was surprisingly delicious?",squid_biscuits,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/13tgssc/whats_a_flavor_combination_you_were_skeptical/,467,331,"Today we happened to have a fresh cataloupe and some quality proscuitto on hand, so we finally tried the melon/proscuitto/balsamic reduction combo. It was fresh, sweet, salty, and had the tangy funk of the balsamic. I'm definitely adding it to the rotation for dinner get togethers.

Now I'm curious about what other combinations folks have found that took you by surprise. Classic, random - tell me all about it!"
