Looking for Turn Based Strategy Game,kawaiiqueenie1990,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/wundrp/looking_for_turn_based_strategy_game/,13,1,"Hello everyone. Having some difficulty finding Turn Based Strategy games that are cute. But when I say cute characters, I meant games such as:  
\- Fire Emblem  
\- Valkyria Chronicles  
\- Shining Force  
\- Tyrant's Blessing  


Okay, Game?  
\- Digimon  
\- Disgea  
\- Final Fantasy Tactics

  
NOT games like...  
\- XCom  
\- Civilization

&#x200B;

I know it sounds weird. But I want to play a game where I read the story and get to understand that character. Or I can see myself in that situation. Does anyone have any recommendations? :) Thanks!"
