I have been writing short stories for the past year, and a recurring theme is that my inspiration randomly turns on and off. My writing will flow for a solid week, and then out of nowhere, it is as if all of that inspiration has disappeared. It doesn't have anything to do with my motivation or being too lazy; I still want to write. But what will happen is I will open the document and spend minutes to sometimes hours typing and deleting and somehow making no progress. But then, after a week of that, I'll wake up on a random morning, and I can feel the creative juices flowing through me, and I am back on track. I am still trying to find the reason for this instant on-and-off switch. It gets annoying when I try to stay consistent with a story. Do you have any suggestions for what is going on and how I could fix these inspirational blocks?"
