Ukraine’s Defense Ministry approves innovative drone with AI elements for mass production,Logical___Conclusion,https://euromaidanpress.com/2023/09/04/ukraine-will-produce-drones-with-ai-elements-for-ukrainian-army/,13,118,"Ukraine has selected a series of AI assisted drones for mass production.

The Electronic Warfare resistant drone can automatically detect camouflaged targets, and send coordinates to command centers, as well as guide nearby kamikaze drones to the targets.

>Ukraine’s Defense Ministry has approved a Saker Scout drone with artificial intelligence elements integrated into its system for mass production and use by the Ukrainian Army, UNIAN reported.

>The Saker Scout software based on artificial intelligence algorithms will help Ukrainian troops destroy Russian military equipment and infantry.

>The innovative drone system independently recognizes and records the coordinates of the enemy’s equipment (even camouflaged) with the help of advanced optics. After that, the drone system immediately transmits the information to a command post to make the appropriate decision.

>The Saker Scout drone complex includes a flagship reconnaissance drone and several FPV kamikaze drones coordinated by the flagship drone.

>The flight range of the Saker Scout drone is up to 10 kilometers. The drones can be equipped with infrared optics to work at night.

>Furthermore, the Saker Scout drones can use an inertial guidance system, significantly increasing their resistance to electronic warfare systems that interfere with the operation of drones."
