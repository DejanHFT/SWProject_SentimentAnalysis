Do you think an A.I. DJ could be made by using a motion sensor camera that reads the movement(reactions) of the crowd?,ShapesforSounds,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/gbjg4/do_you_think_an_ai_dj_could_be_made_by_using_a/,7,0,"So this idea popped in my head.  What if you had a motion sensor camera hooked up to some kind of computer/sound making system with an AI feedback(learning) mechanism that adjusts the type of noise it makes based on amount of movement the camera picks up?  Ideally it would go something like this...A crowd of people are on a dance floor and the motion sensor camera/AI computer sound making system is 'watching' the crowd.  The computer spits out a few noises in a few intervals(call them 'noise groups'). Eventually one of those noise groups sounds a little better than the rest(resembles rhythm or harmony), and the people move(dance) a little bit.  The motion camera picks up on this and sends a signal to the AI program that tells it that the last noise group got a positive result.  The program gives some value to the last noise group, and devalues the others.  The program then tries variations of noise groups similar to the successful one, and continues to read the crowds reaction and learn what works.  The motion sensor camera and AI continually improve figuring out what makes the crowd move until the whole place is dancing and going crazy to music completely written by a computer(or the crowd). 

Really it is similar to how music is written by a single person.  You play sounds until something moves you, and then you keep learning from what works and what doesn't, until you have a piece of music. This AI idea is exactly the same, except the crowd is like your own emotional response and the camera/AI is your own ability to figure out what it is that you played that was responsible for your own emotional response.  Obviously the underlying computer program that crunches the math to try to 'understand'(derive meaning from) the correlations between the movement of the crowd to the changes in the sound created and then extrapolating the knowledge gained to make guesses on to how to amplify that emotion would be real hard, but given enough time it seems it would be doable. 



Could this be considered AI? I think it would be an interesting study of trying to understand the creative principle.  Maybe it's just a big game of guess and check, and there is no formula to create something, only to understand it once it's created...."
