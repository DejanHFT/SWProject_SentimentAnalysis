Why do you want to be fit? What motivates you?,Birdslapper,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1j9f3g/why_do_you_want_to_be_fit_what_motivates_you/,248,45,"For me it's the simple fact that I hate being weak. I was born thin and my brother was born big. Not only did he have 2 years on me, but he was naturally twice my size. I lived my entire childhood and adolescence in the shadow of my brother, but now that I'm a young adult I don't want to make any more excuses for my weakness. I want to be strong, natural body size be damned. What about you?"
