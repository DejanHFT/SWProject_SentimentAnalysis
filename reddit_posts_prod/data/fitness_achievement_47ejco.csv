"Any achievements you've done once, but said, ""Nope, not gonna do THAT again! """,Agent_X10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/47ejco/any_achievements_youve_done_once_but_said_nope/,30,4,"By way of example, once in my late teens I decided to see just how much I could do on a gizmo called a hip sled, which probably have 2-3 dozen names from what I've seen. Essentially a 45 degree angle lifting frame for the legs. A chain, and the frame itself keep you from being squashed to mush if something goes wrong..

So, anyway, due to the mechanical advantage of being on a 45 degree angle, the numbers can get up there fast in just a few weeks of working at it. Most of the exercise seems to come from loading and unloading the plates between reps. Especially when you've got to scavenge plates from all over at higher weights. :D 

I think the amount of weight got to something ridiculous like 1400-1500 pounds, and after building up to it, I could start to feel pressure from every vein in my body pushing inside, toward the outside, by reps 10-12. After which I was like, Ok, that was cool, but still, not gonna do THAT again.  

Thereafter moved on to focus more on dead lifts. 3 weeks after which I ripped off a good section of callus, and had to switch more over to cycling. At least that generally only destroyed shoes. ;D"
