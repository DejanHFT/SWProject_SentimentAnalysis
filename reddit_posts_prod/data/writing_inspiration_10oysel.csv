Therapy and writing: seeking better ways to gain inspiration,YourAllegiance,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/10oysel/therapy_and_writing_seeking_better_ways_to_gain/,3,0,"Hello, fellow writers. I know, the title might sound confusing, I'll try to explain. A lot of my inspiration for writing always came from unprocessed feelings and experiences. In my pieces I always tried to process and acknowledge them. For example: I was in love in someone, whom I couldn't be with, and so were my characters. I didn't know this until I went to therapy and suddenly all my writing exercises stop along with desire to write anything. I tried to understand what's going on, but then realised: it's just easier for me to name and accept my feelings than to write stories about them. When I went to therapy, I learnt how to accept myself and writing was no more of use. 

The point is that I still want to write. I enjoy it when the story I come up with is just for fun. The problem is that it happens very rarely as opposed to ""unprocessed feelings-inspired"" cases. How do I gain inspiration outside of me, not inside? 

Hope I didn't break any rules and at least someone understood what I meant. Thank you in advance for any of your sharings!"
