Are cruises a good way to explore a country?,Ambrosiasaladslaps,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1519ugp/are_cruises_a_good_way_to_explore_a_country/,161,49,"My husband and I (mid 20s) are considering a Greece cruise, but we’ve never been on one before. I feel like it would be a great way to explore a few destinations without worrying about transportation. 

Would this be a good way to explore? Or would we be better off staying in hotels?

Edit: glad I asked, that’s a big no!! We will definitely just stay at hotels."
