What Strategy and Tactics game is your favourite?,ShoerguinneLappel,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11cqa68/what_strategy_and_tactics_game_is_your_favourite/,18,3,"What Real-time and Turn-based Strategy and Tactics game is your favourite? These games can be underrated or well beloved, old or new, but I'm interested to see your recommendations, feel free to explain too. Also it doesn't have to be military focused it can be games like Stronghold that have an economic mode or both.   


If you include both Real-time and Turn-based separate them like this:

Game X

Game Y"
