Make brushed brass at home?,Legoresistantsoles,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15o0ldi,1,0,"Hi there. I purchased a brass plate for a small table I just build and was wondering if it is possible to achieve the brushed brass look at home? Itâ€™s the first time I use brass on a project so I have absolutely no knowledge about metalworks. First image is what I have, second is the look I would like to achieve. My initial thought was to sand it with fine sandpaper or steel wool in a straight line but since these plates are not that cheap, I would love some experience from people who might have done something similar. 
Thanks for any tips and suggestions. Example images welcome :)"
