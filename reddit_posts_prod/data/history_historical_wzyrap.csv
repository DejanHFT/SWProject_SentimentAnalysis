Historical examples of people traveling/gathering to witness a spectacle?,shyguymariolouie,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/wzyrap/historical_examples_of_people_travelinggathering/,27,26,"I’m traveling to Florida space coast to see the launch of NASA’s new SLS rocket, the largest most powerful rocket ever launched from earth, And I’m meeting many people from all over the world who are making the “pilgrimage” to see this rocket that will eventually bring humans back to the moon. they come From around the country and world to witness the launch of the Artemis mission From Kennedy space Center. Are we part of a historical tradition? The scene has me wondering if there are examples in history, especially ancient history, of people traveling or gathering to witness some sort of spectacle. Do you think of any? I’m struggling to come up with any. there are however some great historical newspaper clips of people witnessing the first rocket launches from Cape Canaveral, back before the government realized that announcing these things would be great PR, word we just leak out about this top-secret launches through the “Grapevine“ is how the articles put it. And those didn’t get the word who happened to be out late on Cocoa Beach would get quite a surprise. By the time the mercury program came around launches were announced in the tiny town of Titusville will be overrun with traffic so horrible that houses would burn  down because the fire department couldn’t respond."
