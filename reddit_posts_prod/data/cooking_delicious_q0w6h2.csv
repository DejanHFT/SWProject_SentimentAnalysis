It's just so easy, and melted butter means you don't have to deal with that.

&#x200B;

2 1/4  cups of flour

3/4 cup sugar

3/4 cup brown sugar

1 tsp baking soda

1 tsp salt

2 tsp vanilla

2 eggs

2 sticks melted butter

2 cups chocolate chips.

Then throw them in the oven at 375 degrees for 8-12 minutes depending on how big you made them."
