He (41f) is considering leaving me (40f) because I'm not supportive....I say he's unrealistic and he says I try nothing,FastShine6154,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/n713ch/he_41f_is_considering_leaving_me_40f_because_im/,186,211,"We've been together for 6 years. During that time he's had a job (on and off) that he hates, but is quite lucrative.

I have a job that is pretty dead-end, but honestly I'm ok with it and it's as much as I can handle (suffer from anxiety and depression at different times).

&#x200B;

One common theme is him looking for a Great New Idea that will make him super rich. He's very ambitious and always coming up with new ideas. I am...not. And I know this is a character flaw in me, but it's always been there.

&#x200B;

I have always always been completely behind him in all his ideas. I've always helped him in any way he needs. Literally hours and hours of hands-on help in whatever he needs. Twice when he was between jobs he came up with Great New Ideas (neither of which honestly sounded like sure things to me) that I was very supportive of and helped him. For endless hours. Neither went anywhere and in the end he wasted a lot of money and had to find a real job again.

When he is involved I one of these Great New Ideas, it overtakes our lives. To give you an idea, once he had an idea involving liquid silicone (I won't get into it but it had to do with parts for the industry he works in). For months my house was covered in bits of dried silicone. Everything was pushed aside  in the dining room, etc. And I worked with him for many hours trying to get it right. It never took off.

&#x200B;

Now he's again between jobs, and again trying to come up with Great New Ideas that will bring in a lot of money so he doesn't have to go back to work (and he wants to travel! and buy a boat! and maybe a cottage! and retire early!). I'm so tired at this point. He's come up with 2 Great New Ideas and I want nothing to do with either of them. 

&#x200B;

He posted them on facebook and got all these people encouraging him (he is a bit of a minor local celebrity on there, and has many adoring followers). This is another issue for me....he's very attention seeking. If anyone were to read his facebook page, they'd believe him to be a rich, very smart inventor. Meanwhile, not a single idea has taken off.

&#x200B;

He wanted me to help him with on of the latest ideas and I said no. That started a fight and I admitted that I'm tired of his ideas. That none of them have taken off, it takes a lot of time and it wastes money, and I just want him to concentrate on getting a job instead.

&#x200B;

He got very angry and said I'm not supportive and I never try anything....at least he tries, and that makes him smarter than me. 

&#x200B;

He also said unless I'm supportive, we probably aren't going to work out. This after 6 years and SO MANY HOURS I've helped him.

&#x200B;

At this point, should I just let him go? I do love him, but I'm tired.

&#x200B;

tldr: he is very ambitious and I am not. He says unless I'm supportive of his latest idea (which doesn't sound very logical at all) then he thinks we should break up."
