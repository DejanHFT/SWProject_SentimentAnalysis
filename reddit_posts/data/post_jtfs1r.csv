AskScience AMA Series: We're NASA experts looking for scientists' input on the next decade of biological and physical science research in space. Ask us anything!,AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/jtfs1r/askscience_ama_series_were_nasa_experts_looking/,335,3687,"We use the unique attributes of spaceflight environments to conduct scientific experiments that cannot be done on Earth. NASA's Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) program pioneers scientific discovery in and beyond low-Earth orbit to drive advances in science, technology and space exploration. These space experiments expand the frontiers of knowledge, capability and opportunity in space.

This year, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) will begin the process of formulating a community consensus about the most compelling science questions for the decade ahead in each of the BPS disciplines. Known as the Decadal Surveys, the process provides a rare opportunity for scientists and engineers to share their insights and help shape the scientific endeavors of the next decade.

The purpose of this AMA is to answer questions about the work being done by NASA's Biological and Physical Sciences division and to address how researchers can get engaged in the Decadal process, types of past research efforts stemming from the previous survey, the types of research that the BPS division supports, etc.

Panelists:

+ **Craig Kundrot**, Director, Biological and Physical Sciences Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASA
+ **Bradley Carpenter**, Program Scientist for Fundamental Physics, Biological and Physical Sciences Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASA
+ **Kevin Sato**, Program Scientist for Exploration, Biological and Physical Sciences Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASA
+ **Fran Chiaramonte**, Program Scientist for Physical Sciences, Biological and Physical Sciences Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASA
+ **Sharmila Bhattacharya**, Program Scientist, Space Biology, Biological and Physical Sciences Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASA

We will be here from  1:30-3:30 pm ET (18:30-20:38 UT), ask us anything!
