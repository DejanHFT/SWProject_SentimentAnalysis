does anyone have experience with offering ELOs Credit-for-learning programs,Revolutionary-Coast9,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/ulucq8/does_anyone_have_experience_with_offering_elos/,0,4,"Hi,

I am not sure if I should question in the non-profit section.

I teach k-12 Computer Science and the schools in my community do not offer much for Computer Science in the primary grades. I am interested in learning more from people who may have a background in offering Credit-for-learning programs, also known in some communities as extended learning opportunities (ELOs)."
