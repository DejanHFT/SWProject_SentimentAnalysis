I (M32) just hit it off with a new friend (F25) but realized she has a big problem with alcohol. How can I be supportive/not enable at the casual friendship level?,9ftPegasusBodybuildr,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15i6pkt/i_m32_just_hit_it_off_with_a_new_friend_f25_but/,9,1,"Have really enjoyed the times that we have hung out, this is definitely one of those rare connections where things click, but she knowingly has a problem with alcoholism. She is really frustrated by it and wants to go to rehab soon which obviously I'm glad to hear, but in the meantime she needs alcohol to function and it makes me uncomfortable.

I was a little late for a meetup the other day and while she was waiting she popped into a nearby bar. I knew she was driving home after, and I offered to get her an uber or drive her home, but she gave the old ""I do this every day, it's nice of you to offer, but it's not your responsibility and I don't want to lie to you and say I won't be driving drunk later on, and if I weren't hanging out with you I'd be drinking more""

We're definitely not close enough that I should be responsible for her or slapping drinks out of her hand, but I still want to make sure I'm not behaving in a way that makes things worse. I know she doesn't have a whole lot of other friends in the area, and certainly not any that would be any help to her trying to get sober.

We try to plan to exclusively do things where they don't serve alcohol when we hang out, but when she does stuff like going out of her way to get a drink, I don't know how to respond. At this point we've spent like a single digit number of hours together, I'm not trying to sermonize at her or stage an intervention for a new friend.

For context I drink pretty much just at special occasions. Never had any trouble with drugs or substances of any kind, don't even drink coffee. I really enjoy getting to know people from different backgrounds/walks of life, and don't like to be judgmental. But I don't want my open mindedness to turn into enablement.

There's always the option to say ""I really enjoy spending time with you but because of your disease I don't want to be friends with you."" That feels... shitty. Plus I'm not sure sending the message ""you're only capable of being friends with the types of people who are going to make this worse"" is any better than outright enabling her.

I am most concerned with the drinking and driving, I don't like the idea of letting her go out and risking other people's safety. I typically meet up with her where she is after she gets out of work, so I do like that she's not doing *extra* driving on my account, and because we hang out she misses the worst of 5 o'clock traffic. Still, I'd be content if I could feel good about my policy towards DUI

Edit: Further context, in case it's not clear, this is not at this point looking like a romantic prospect. I'm seeing someone else and she sort of is too.

TL;DR made a new friend, lots of potential for us to get along, but her alcoholism is severe and I don't know what kinds of boundaries are appropriate"
