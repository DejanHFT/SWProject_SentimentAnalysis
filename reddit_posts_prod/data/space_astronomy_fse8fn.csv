Hello this is my first post here; I've always been an astronomy enthusiast. I'm new to Reddit.

I always loved space and what's beyond since I was just a child so in my first year at college I joined the physics and astronomy club in it.

At first, I saw a lot of potential in the club and I was very excited to join, and that douche of a ""president"" had the best way to convince you to join the club. He promised us with a lot of activities and camping trips, and he promised that by one year we would be professional telescope operators and none of have even touched a telescope. We even paid an entrance fee which is worth like 5 USD and that was money down the drain. He told us he would get keynote speakers every now and then. Only one keynote speaker came, none of the members have heard of him before his name was Arthur and he made a fool of himself on stage.

We only did one telescope ""Training Session"" out of the many promised, where the so called ""committee members"" where delivering it and none of them knew how to operate the telescope.

They promised us with a ""Physics Day"" on April 1st which should be tomorrow, now that's out of the window. Also, they promised they would get a cosmic dome which I was really excited for but still no delivery.

This president changed the vice president of the club without consulting any of the club members. That's one of the many things he does without consulting anyone. And the most irritating and lowest thing that this committee did is that they hire a professional telescope trainer for themselves from OUR entrance fee money without telling any of the club members to attend.

The president claims we are the biggest club in college with over 80 members, but I doubt that, because none of them show up to club meetings.

Now they want another 5 USD fee to renew my subscription, they won't a penny from me.

Astronomy clubs should be fun and educative not for personal gain or at least people shouldn't lie about their clubs in general. If the whole committee and the president don't change next semester, I'm leaving this club

This was my experience let me know yours."
