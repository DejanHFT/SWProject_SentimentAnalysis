Best resources to learn math (algebra & geometry) and physics?,Dapper-Birthday-3970,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1128b4y/best_resources_to_learn_math_algebra_geometry_and/,10,14,"I completely missed out on math and physics in school and now would like to catch up on the knowledge. To give you an understanding of my level - I know basically nothing of physics (except from random pieces of knowledge I've been picking up on the internet) and barely remember basic algebra.

Please recommend courses/books/resources where I could study"
