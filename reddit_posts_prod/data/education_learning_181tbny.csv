Project-based learning,Caribouofthehills,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/181tbny/projectbased_learning/,16,7,"Hi all,

I'm a parent from Australia who has learned their child's school will be requiring all Yr 7 students to do project based learning. I see the merits of it in some cases, but at the same time, the results from it seem shaky. To add, I've yet to see any long-term research evidence that this is a fab method of student learning.

I'm all for exploring new ways to learn, but seeing that much of the research or schools I'm aware did PBL, seem to end the trial early with no real indication why. Just determined it wasn't an option. I have tried to speak to the school about it, but they clearly have been copping a bit of flak from the parents over this, and are not really answering questions very well (I know I could move my child, but I also don't want to jump ship if I'm being unnecessarily concerned about it).

Does anyone have experience with PBL, is it positive or negative? I'd love to hear from both sides. I'm trying to keep a very open mind on this topic. 

TIA!"
