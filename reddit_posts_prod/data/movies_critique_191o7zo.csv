Saltburn - Did I miss the point?,mal221,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/191o7zo/saltburn_did_i_miss_the_point/,97,82,"Firstly, I don't think this was a bad movie, but I'm not sure it was for the reasons intended. I found this movie funny. Like laugh out loud funny. I have seen this billed as a comedy, but not many reviewers highlighting the humour as one of the main selling points. Most of the reviews have been saying that it was a dark mystery and was unsettling and uncomfortable. I don't see any of that.  


The whole thing feels like an edgy Jeeves and Wooster novel. It's kind of dark farce. But still farce, like am I too believe people had a genuine connection with any of the people? I mean they're not terrible, like the amount of hate piled on Felix seems way out of proportion.   


He's probably the least deserving of his fate. He becomes a victim of other people's perceptions of him rather than his understandable actions. I found Oliver to be thoroughly dislikable in a fun way. He's a pantomime villain, like the Phantom of the Opera who can't sing. But ultimately anything he does or fails to do, I don't care, he's a mess. Also the grave shagging scene was pure hilarity. Like is that supposed to be disturbing? Dude's out in the rain wanking into a hole in the ground. That's hilarious.  


Other from that the rest of characters played pretty funny supporting roles, the mad ditzy Pamela was wonderful in a Helena Boham Carter inspired quirk-fest. Richard E Grant steals every scene he is in, something a little Withnail about his angry outburst at the dinner table, which was great. Farleigh seemed to be playing the role of the catty evil sister, his departure didn't make too much sense and his character seemed superfluous.  

The mother and sister characters were fairly boiler plate, nothing out of the ordinary. The sister was very one dimensional, while Elspeth her mother was maybe a little more fun. Again I was chasing laughs here and the ""I'm a vampire"" scene was more reminiscent of something like American Pie, kind of 90's gross out humour to throw popcorn to rather than anything truly shocking. On a small side note the Butler, was that a red herring? If so, it's explanation was left on the cutting room floor at some stage, kind of disappeared in the third act never to be seen again.

The themes and take-aways are another thing I'm struggling with comprehending. A lot of people making stretches to the film being a critique on class? I mean the only thing that's revealed here is sociopaths are sociopaths and rich people have a lot of stuff and tend to enjoy themselves. If that's a revelation then you're going to lose your mind watching the news. I found Felix's actions noble enough while Oliver was deranged whatever way it was spun. However, my partner think Oliver is on his way to becoming an incel hero, that I can see.

Overall I did enjoy the movie, but I'm not quite sure I watched the same movie as everyone else, it was a solid 6/10 pressing 7/10. But things it was not: Shocking, Deep or a class critique. Things it was: Silly, Over the top and vapid. Also is Saltburn a reference to Caustic Soda, a salt that can burn you, also known as Lye, as the place is full of lies. That's about as deep as I read into any of it. That's my two cents.
