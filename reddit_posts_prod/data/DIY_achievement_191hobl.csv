Cork Floor Pads/Tiles,XariaDB,https://i.redd.it/x4vq3lxnu6bc1.jpeg,2,1,"Hi Everyone!

Looking for a cost effective way to achieve this. I am looking to fill up my studio apartment with these. Space is about 13 feet by 17 feet or 4.2 meters by 5.2 meters. Looking at 6mm to 10mm thick cork.

Use of space is for floor sleeping with shikibution, yoga, floor seating with low tables. Basically an alternative to tatami mats. I haven't seen these cork floor pads in person from Yoloha https://yolohayoga.com/en-ca/products/cork-floor-pad

But I believe they have the same finish as a cork yoga mat for ease of cleaning, smooth to the feel and not grainy like a cork underlayment for instance. I like the idea of each tile to be 24 inches by 24 inches. The modularity characteristic is important, if I ever needed to move out of this apartment. Anyways would love to hear ideas on how to achieve this. Thank you!!

For reference Yoloha is charging $745 for 12 tiles ðŸ˜­ and for area of the space I need it for. I'd need somewhere around 4 sets of the 13 piece set they have. So that's about $2980 ðŸ’”"
