Are you over 30? Come check out /r/Fitness30plus,eric_twinge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/29nqja/are_you_over_30_come_check_out_rfitness30plus/,221,393,"The idea for the sub was borne out of a discussion in r/fitness several months ago. 

/r/Fitness30plus is a place for older redditors to discuss health and fitness matters with others facing the same changing lifestyle and time demands.  **It's not about slowing down, it's about keeping up.**  

We're a small sub be we've got a pretty good crew of people posting topics and contributing to the discussions.  We've got some weekly threads in place too:

* New Beginnings Mondays - a general thread for people looking to try out new things and get some tips from others beforehand.
* Teaching Tuesdays - every week a new lift or exercise is discussed and lessons learned and experience/tips are shared.  [This week was dips](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/29k60n/teaching_tuesdays_dips/).
* Wellness Wednesdays - Here we rotate through various rehab, prehab, and recovery techniques.  [Today we're focusing on elbows](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/29nj70/wellness_wednesday/).
* PR Fridays - A success thread to share PRs or achievements in the week before.  

And finally, even though it's ""30+"" we don't discriminate on age.  We have plenty of people in their 20s joining in.  Essentially, if you don't jive with the with the college (or younger) lifestyle and are looking to balance fitness pursuits in with a full-time job, a family, and other demands that come with age, hop aboard.  

If you're interested, we'd love to have you join us at /r/Fitness30plus."
