Wright also added: ""We were going to do this in August, but make no mistake, this will happen soon. #ScottPilgrim back on the big screen thanks to [@DolbyCinema](https://twitter.com/DolbyCinema) & [@UniversalPics](https://twitter.com/UniversalPics). Can't wait.""

Anyone else excited for this? This movie didn't do well at the box office 10 years ago, but has developed a cult following... excited to see it making waves these days!
