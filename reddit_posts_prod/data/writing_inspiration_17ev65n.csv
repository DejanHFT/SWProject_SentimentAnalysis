Where does taking inspiration from an idea end and “ripping off” begin?,velvetmoon07,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/17ev65n/where_does_taking_inspiration_from_an_idea_end/,6,1,"I’m plotting out the series of events for one character and am aware that her main plot point has taken a lot of inspiration from a character in a show I love. The issue I have is this is really helping me with the metaphor I’ve wanted to use this character for but I don’t want to completely rip off an idea.

I know I am being so vague on this so apologies if that does help but if anyone does have any thoughts/opinions on this, I’m very interested to know"
