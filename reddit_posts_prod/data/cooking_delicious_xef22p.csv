delicious sauce...or disaster?,laura_pants,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/xef22p/delicious_sauceor_disaster/,10,4,"Tonight is a use what's in the fridge kinda night. 

I'm making sausage with cabbage/leek/squash/bell pepper. I was thinking of serving it over egg noodles and making some sort of gravy or sauce. This is just something that pooped in my head so I have no idea if it's a thing or will even work.

Is it a thing?
Would you do this?
If so what kind of sauce/gravy/liquid topping would you do?

Thanks!"
