improving technical writing skill vs. seeking writing inspiration?,zuko1010,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/srsrbe/improving_technical_writing_skill_vs_seeking/,5,4,"hey everyone! thanks in advance for answering this question, it has to do with my college major.

I'm a writer who wants to seriously pursue publication and improve my writing skills; however, I'm unsure if I want to major in English/Creative Writing in college. I'd like to learn more about writing and the more technical aspects of it but it seems from what some English majors have told me that there isn't any value in an English degree besides learning about my passion (which is important! but ultimately passion won't pay the bills for me). if I pursue english/creative writing as a major in college, I plan on also majoring in political science and pursuing a minor in history/some type of cultural studies so I look more appealing to future employers. but some english majors have also told me that they wished they never majored in English because it killed their love for writing and because they learned nothing they couldn't have figured out on their own.

I guess I'm trying to figure out the benefits of having an English degree and would like to hear the experiences of those who have one (especially about how it helped your writing skills and whether getting one helped you professionally). I'm wondering if it's even worth it to get an English degree at all if I won't learn anything. if that's the case, i'd much rather major in history and political science and minor in english/creative writing. I like studying history and often use historical situations as inspiration for my work (I write primarily fantasy in second-world settings, if that's at all relevant). so I think learning about history, especially time periods I'm interested in, could potentially help me with feeling more inspired to write.

tldr: is an English degree worth it? does it help you master the technical skills of writing? and if it does or doesn't, what are your thoughts on pursuing english to improve one's writing skills vs. pursuing history to get more inspiration for my writing? which do you think is more valuable and why?"
