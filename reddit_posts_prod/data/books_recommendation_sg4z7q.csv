"Book recommendations- please, listen what people asked for.",Eireika,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/sg4z7q/book_recommendations_please_listen_what_people/,601,2848,"And don't bring up books that doesn't fulfill the criteria because you like it.

It's a long running joke and woe to the mods of r/Fantasy that some people will reccomend Sanderson/Wheel of Time/Malazan regadless of questions asked- something funny with LBGTQ+? World with no patriarchy? Time Travel? S/WOT/M! You can swear that every book sub and group has a bunch that always surfaces in this kinds of threads, no matter how specific the question was.

But sometimes I can't help but wonder if people reccomending it are that clueless or actively malicious. I read a post of a person who recovered from trauma and wanted something funny and optymistic- and was reccomended ""House of Spirits"" by Isabel Allende. You know, that- otherwise great - book that was written as a discussion about history of Chile, full of violence and trauma of all flavours.I know- one enamored with book wants to share it with everyone in the world, but not everything is great every time for everyone."
