"I'm (27f) infertile, and sad about Mother's Day this year after I got a hysterectomy. My husband (27m) of five years is having trouble being supportive.",Infertilemothersday,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4i8snn/im_27f_infertile_and_sad_about_mothers_day_this/,49,170,"We have been married for 5 years, together for nearly 8. During our five years of marriage, we battled infertility. We tried all the treatments available to us, and even tried to adopt from the foster system (which, long story short, fell through and was devastating) 3 years ago. During this, I originally believed my husband wanted children as badly as I did due to a talk we had early in our relationship. Later, I found out that he was ""indifferent"" to having children. 

Anyway, 7 rounds of oral medications, 3 surgeries, 5 rounds of artificial insemination, one round of IVF, a failed adoption, and a big cancer scare later, I got a hysterectomy due to a variety of medical reasons.

Now, he's had trouble being very supportive through most of this. He didn't want to go to Dr appointments unless I told him he needed to be there for our infertility struggles. He never really understood why I was having so much trouble with the idea of never becoming a mother. 

Fast forward to tonight. In two days, Mother's Day 2016 will arrive. It's my first Mothers Day without even the slightest glimmer of hope to become a mom. Everything has been crushed. I don't have a uterus, we have a lot of bills to pay off before we can even consider fostering, and private adoption is way out of our reach financially. I have nothing. 

I was, naturally, upset tonight. While he played a video game, I poured it out. I thought he had put his game down, but when he responded to some statements inappropriately, I asked if he was listening. He said yes, and I started to cry. He looked up at me, and then went back to his game. 

When I got upset about that, I told him he needed to pay more attention to what was going on. That's when he got upset. He told me I need to get over it. He said that I am holding onto something that will never be, and to let it go. I did mention I wanted some time to grieve, and he was frustrated. He believes I've been grieving during our entire infertility fight, which may be true...but now it's over, and it's hitting me hard. 

He asked if I have been taking any antidepressants, and he asked if this is what we have to look forward to for every mothers day. 

""You want this Mother's Day to grieve, but then you'll want the 2nd mothers day [after your hysterectomy], and then the 3rd, 4th, 5th...when will it end? How long will you grieve for? You need to let it go.""

I don't know how many mothers days I will grieve. After all I've been through to have a child, it might be 2 or 3 or 4 or 5....or more. Infertility is something that never goes away. It's with you forever, and I haven't broken down about not having children at all since my hysterectomy. I've been strong, and I've been planning on getting my degrees, working, and I've even talked about fun things I want to see in the future...so I don't understand his lack of support for this time of year despite being a little more supportive through my breakdowns other years.

Can anyone, please, either tell me that I'm being totally irrational, or help me explain to him that expecting me to be over it now is unreasonable? I don't know how to put this so he will understand. 


Tl;Dr: Tried to have kids for 6-7 years, failed, got a hysterectomy. I'm sad about being completely  infertile and mothers day is coming up.  My husband can't understand why I am not over it."
