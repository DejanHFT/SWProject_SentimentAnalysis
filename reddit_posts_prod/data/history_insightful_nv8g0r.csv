Birthing Laws/Requirements Throughout History?,DeetGeek06,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/nv8g0r/birthing_lawsrequirements_throughout_history/,215,749,"I believe I heard in a podcast once that Romans would encouraged married couples to produce lots of children so that the nation would have a dense military. 

I find this interesting because nowadays, we have countries like China imposing *restrictions* on child births. Have there ever been similiar instances throughout history, of a nation requiring their citizens to produce several children?"
