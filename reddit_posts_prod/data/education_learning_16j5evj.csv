Learning to learn again. How ? Is it even possible at this point?,Next_Celery_Please,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/16j5evj/learning_to_learn_again_how_is_it_even_possible/,20,5,"I'm 30 and after 13 years of severe alcohol abuse and chronic THC use I've decided to go back to school (college), and I'm really struggling.

I heavily struggled through highschool because I'm not academically talented.
I've spent my adult years, so far, in the restaurant industry just doing as I'm told mindlessly and getting intoxicated daily. 

I'm 3 weeks sober now. 

My first 2 weeks of college have been torture. There's so much reading, so many assignments. So much critical thinking. Really high expectations of my prior knowledge that I was not expecting! 

I'm only taking 2 classes. I've been studying 12hrs+ a day and still unable to complete readings and after putting my 110% effort into assignments... I produce pure confused garbage. 
I've been so behind in readings that I end up staying up till 3am and get 4hrs of sleep a night. I don't have time to make food or eat because before I even know it it's 3am and I've only clearly understood like 10% of the material expected for the next day's class.
And the funny part... I'm taking leisure and recreation studies... my social circle thinks the program is a joke and doesn't think I'm struggling because it's supposedly ""easy"". It's not. There is so much theory and critical thinking involved. AND SO MUCH WRITTING!

I've been told that my brain needs to heal and it's not conditioned to learn like the other kids here. My peers are taking 5/6 classes, working full time, partying, and achieving better grades than I. What the fuck is going on? 
Any experiences with this? 
How long till I start being able to retain information again? 
Should I just give up? I've read that school just isn't for some people. I'm starting to think my brain is not developed properly. Or I'm just plain stupid. Haha"
