Motivating the unmotivatable... strategy help? (30year old virgin - 400lbs),Lokified,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/176kqt/motivating_the_unmotivatable_strategy_help_30year/,404,339,"Hello /fitness,


I have a bit of a problem.  My life-long friend has struggled with his weight for as long as I've known him.  The trouble is he can never stick to any exercise or diet program.  Eventually he gives up and goes back to his old habits of daily pizza and coke.  I haven't been able to find that carrrot to keep him on his path.  He is pushing 400lbs and is starting to really get fearful for his life, but somehow that still isn't enough.


I came up with something that he's starting to come around to.  He makes a lot of money, but is crazy cheap.  I suggested he give me $600/month and he gets $20 back any day that he sticks to his diet.  Anytime he blows it, that $20 is lost to charity (local food bank).  He wants the money to go towards something fun for the house, but I worry that will take some of the incentive away.  My way, somebody wins.  Him, or the charity!


Anyone ever tried this, or have other suggestions to add to this?  I've tried holding his hand through dieting and exercise many times and it's never stuck.  It usually ends in him ""emoing out"" and locking himself in  his room with pizzas for a few weeks.  


And for those of the opinion that I shouldn't meddle, he'll come around on his own... he won't.  I've heard him piss and moan about his weight for almost twenty years.  He needs a major kick in the ass.

**EDIT**

Thanks everyone for all of the input.  This is my takeaway from this

* I can't motivate him, he has to want it bad enough
* He needs therapy
* Consider Keto
* Watch Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead with him
* Get him to a doctor to put a proper scare in him


You guys are great, I knew you'd have some good info and ideas for me!"
