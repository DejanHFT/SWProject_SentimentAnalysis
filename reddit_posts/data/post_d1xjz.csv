"reddit, I lost it tonight. i need help.",throwaway234567,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d1xjz/reddit_i_lost_it_tonight_i_need_help/,782,682,"first off, I am not the type of person who asks anyone for any type of help. I usually ignore these types of threads. 


i am a 31 year old recently unemployed man battling alcoholism & depression. i had to move in with my father this year (who is also an alcoholic) because I ran out of money. i decided to quit drinking about a week ago after almost a year of being blitzed. It has been extremely difficult, actually, its been one of the hardest things I've ever done, but I have manged to make it 8 days sober.

I don't have any friends, and my family has mostly died off with the exception of my dad. 2 suicides last year. Pretty much everyone on my mothers side were alcoholics. I don't have anyone to talk to, and I'm not getting any type of support from anyone. I am on my own. 

I've always had a bad temper, but I lost it big time tonight.  My dad and I don't get along anymore.. just imagine two big angry drunks living together. We got into a fight tonight, fists were exchanged. Broken door, holes in walls. I grabbed a knife, I wanted to kill him. I threw the knife down and broke down into tears. I  left. I was terrified at what I had done. If it weren't for him, I would not be here.. I would not have made it through the past 6 years. I love him to death. I feel like an awful person.. and lets face it, I am. who does this type of shit? 


I just called him, and he doesn't want me back at the house anymore. I lost the will to live several years ago, but I feel that this is it, I have nothing. No marketable skills, no school, and now no place to call home, absolutely nothing. I've got all kinds of health issues as well and no money to get help, which I desperately need.

I'm sitting out front of starbucks right now with a gash in my head, i'm sure I look pretty pathetic.

what do I do? where do I go? how do I get help?

**EDIT**: thanks for the advice. I just talked to my dad, he agreed to let me come back.
I guess I am not as strong as I thought I was. I need outside support. 

**EDIT 2:** just wanted to say that even though I'm not replying to every single comment, I'm reading them all. Thanks again reddit

**EDIT 3:** I caved in. Tonight has been rough. I scrapped together some change and bought a bottle of whiskey. Also, if it matters now, what I failed to mention (i dont even know why) is that 8 days ago, along with trying to quit alcohol cold turkey, I tried to quit percoset & cigarettes. 8 days without alcohol, cigarettes and percoset. Cold turkey. Several people I have talked to through PM have informed me that this is stupid.. you can't do this. small steps etc..I guess I need to pick addiction, stop, and carry on to the next. I cant believe I am posting my story here on reddit."
