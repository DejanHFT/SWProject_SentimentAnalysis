Examples of instances where fascism was on the rise but *didn't* take over?,HappySachi,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/lxq3ho/examples_of_instances_where_fascism_was_on_the/,63,94,"I'm currently reading about the Spanish Civil War, want to read about the Weimar Republic next, and I'm wondering: are there historical examples of instances where fascism was rising in popularity but didn't become the dominating political force? I know there was a certain degree of support for fascism in the UK in the 30s, does anybody have insight on why it didn't take hold? Or any other examples, thanks a lot!

edit: Please don't respond with current politics, I'm genuinely curious about this from a historical perspective and I don't want my post to get taken down. Thank you!"
