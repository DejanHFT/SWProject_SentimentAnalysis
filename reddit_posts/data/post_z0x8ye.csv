AskScience AMA Series: I'm a wildlife filmmaker who's spent years tracking and filming the endangered ocelot population in Texas. Ask me anything!,AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/z0x8ye/askscience_ama_series_im_a_wildlife_filmmaker/,185,2601,"Hi, I'm Ben Masters, wildlife filmmaker and ocelot enthusiast. I studied wildlife biology at Texas A&M University and founded the production company [Fin and Fur Films](https://www.finandfurfilms.com/about) in 2015. 

There are fewer than 120 ocelots remaining in the US. With many factors acting against them, there is still hope for their survival, if opposing parties can come to an agreement on their management methods. I've spent years in Texas capturing the first-ever high-quality footage of American ocelots in the wild, meeting with stakeholders along the way to raise awareness about conservation solutions.

You can learn more about these efforts in the recent PBS Nature documentary ""[American Ocelot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiQ8zOlWHUQ&t),"" now available to stream in the US.

I'll be answering your questions at 1 pm ET (18 UT). Ask me anything!
