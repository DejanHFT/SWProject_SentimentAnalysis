G Adventures - Antarctica - Any experiences?,rbscka,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17ygzz4/g_adventures_antarctica_any_experiences/,4,3,"Hi folks - looking to see if anyone has taken the Antarctica tour from G Adventures or with another company. Highlights? Low-lights? 

Looking at travelling Nov '24 to Feb '25. Since I'm on the eastern seaboard, I was thinking about going earlier (Nov) because there is a better chance that the roads are clear over here for travel to and from a larger airport (Like Boston, NYC ~6 hours away)"
