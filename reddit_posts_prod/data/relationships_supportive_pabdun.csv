How can I (40f) be emotionally supportive of my ex husband (47m)?,Mama3bears1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pabdun/how_can_i_40f_be_emotionally_supportive_of_my_ex/,40,17,"As I posted here last week, my ex husband is in an abusive relationship with the woman he left me for. This morning I got a picture from him his head split open, his eye bloody, and covered in blood, with a caption of “do you think this qualifies as a splitting headache?”.

Apparently, she smacked him with a golf club. I asked him if he’s okay and he said he is, he was at the hospital and had his daughter. His sister went and got the daughter from him at the hospital and is fine. 

I asked him what had happened and he said he told her that he and I are soulmates. She lost it and attacked him. He is telling me that he just needs to be my friend and that is all he wants, to be friends with me and have a good relationship with our children.

I also want him to have a good relationship with his children. He does not have a good one with our two oldest boys at this point… he has been asking me to talk to him all day. Could we please talk on the phone. He needs a friend. 

I haven’t because I am afraid to get involved. I don’t want to hurt my children or myself anymore. However, I am so in love with this man and I do want him in my life.

So I am looking for advice on how to be there for him. Is it okay to be part of his emotional support as he goes through this? He has to stay in the hospital tonight and then he will start staying with his sister, who has confirmed that yes, it is real. 


Tl;dr ex is was attacked by his wife and is in the hospital this morning. Looking for advice on how to be supportive of him in this.


EDIT: we did end up talking briefly and he told me he was looking for something to do. I told him that I think he should write apology letters to his sons for his behavior. He start sobbing. I felt bad but maybe he’ll do it."
