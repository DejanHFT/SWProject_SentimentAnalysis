It feels like a legitimate marketing strategy to release a game barely playable.,DragonC007,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/yyx7j2/it_feels_like_a_legitimate_marketing_strategy_to/,17,11,"This has happened far too often with far too many big titles. No Man’s Sky did it with understandable and viable reasons but then massive companies like CD projekt red and now even Nintendo themselves releasing massive titles just completely broken? There’s no chance a huge company like these don’t actually see the same thing the player does. How is anything just not tested ?

Either this is a clever but stupid marketing scheme to get people talking about your game you can just patch later, or companies just don’t care anymore about the quality of games."
