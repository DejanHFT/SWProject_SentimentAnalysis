Can Freedom of Thought Ever Be Destroyed?,CmdrSlander,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1f98ms/can_freedom_of_thought_ever_be_destroyed/,11,10,"Is it possible for a person to lose their freedom of thought? Not their free will, mind you, but their actual ability to create and process ideas that are contrary to accepted norms. Is it possible for a society, religion or other powerful entity to be so oppressive that freedom of thought - the very contemplation of dissent or alternative modes of doing things is stamped out? 

----------------------------------

I believe that it is possible for a person to be repressed or indoctrinated that they immediately - but voluntarily - shut down any thoughts contrary to their indoctrination/beliefs, but I think everyone still has dissenting thoughts, even if they don't want them. I believe this occurs only when a person wants to believe in a given dogma."
