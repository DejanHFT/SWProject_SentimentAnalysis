Please  help me find the possible routes for exploring Parvati valley (India) by hiking  around. So far I have identified following options which cover these  POI villages - Rasol, Waichin, Tosh, Pulga/Tulga/Kulga, Grahan &  Kheerganga (If it's not too crowded)

&#x200B;

* Bunbuni - From kalga 5hrs - Can go ahead to Kheerganga from here
* Buddhaban & Glacier point from Tosh - 2hr hike from tosh passing through Kutla
* Kheerganga - Pulga Tulga Kulga villages otw, nakthan village on different trail
