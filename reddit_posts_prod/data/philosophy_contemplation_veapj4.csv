**Chapter 1 –** **A view to the nature of human activity as arborescent**

Let us visualise an oak tree. Its roots hold firm onto the Earth and as its trunk towers upwards numerous branches sprout out of it. In turn, big branches divide into many smaller ones. Aristotle starts off his treatise by implicitly asking us to liken the sum of human activity to a great tree. The ends of some activities are like small branches. However small the branches, they are still necessary for big branch activities which are in turn needed for the ends of activities attached to the trunk and finally the root.

**Chapter 2 –** **Politics as the highest art**

“What is then the goal and root cause of the frenetic activity of humans?” Aristotle asks. He continues “If we knew what this ultimate goal is, would we not be better able to orient ourselves towards it?”

The answer to the latter question is an obvious “Yes, absolutely.” Afterall, the first thing we need to know in order to play darts is the location of the bulls-eye.

With regards to the former question, however, Aristotle does not give us a fast answer. He rather puts a few more pieces of the puzzle together for us. We return to our image of the oak tree. In this case, Aristotle instructs us that the trunk of the tree is politics, the sum of political activity. The goal of political activity is then, continues Aristotle, the welfare of humans.

**Chapter 3 –** **Acquiring the right mindset for this investigation**

One of Aristotle's insights that we can draw from this chapter is that the first step to realising ourselves as capable persons is to become deeply aware of what things exactly we know and to what point of clarity.

Once we acquire the consciousness to distinguish what we know well, what we know somewhat and recognise in which subjects we are completely ignorant, we will also become capable to seek that knowledge.

There are many people, however, always willing to impart their advice. Aristotle asks us to find and listen to the people most capable to teach us what we want to learn.

In Disney comics, Donald Duck is always willing to try to fix the cars of other people and he always leaves the cars he ""fixes"" way worse than how they were before. You do not go to Donald Duck to fix your car you go to a car mechanic.

**Chapter 4 –** **Carry with you an initial viewpoint and an open mind**

We generally understand that the aim of politics is the welfare of the state and that what this is supposed to mean is that the task of politicians is to ensure the happiness and prosperity of the citizens.

When we try to investigate what happiness exactly means, however, we will probably get as many answers as the people we ask. For this reason, Aristotle asks us to first reflect and make our own definition of what happiness exactly means. It does not matter if it is wrong or in what way it might be wrong. The important thing here is to have a starting point.

Once we have a point from which to begin our investigation, the second thing we need is a mind open to explore the ideas and arguments of others on this same topic. Aristotle warns that unless we have these two things ( a - an initial point of view, b - an open mind) our investigation on the nature of happiness will not bear fruit.

**Chapter 5 - The three prominent types of life**

In this chapter we return to futher investigate the nature of the highest good. Aristotle first places side by side what he considers the ""three prominent types of life"". What distinguishes each type of life from the others is what the people who lead it equate with happiness and consequently aim at. The three types of life are:

(1) the life of enjoyment. Those who lead it are content with pleasure as their highest good.

(2) the political or active life which belongs to those who equate happiness with receiving honour and recognition of their merit.

(3) the contemplative life which Aristotle will pick up later.

Finally, Aristotle dismisses the life purely devoted to money making as merely compulsive. He quips that money in itself is a means and not an end.

**Chapter 6 - The good as such and the good for humans in particular**

Aristotle draws a line between what Plato calls the good and the good he pursues. For Plato all things proceed from the highest good and in this way all things contain it. Humans, however, cannot comprehend this good, much less attain it. Aristotle, as opposed to Plato, seeks a highest good which humans can both comprehend and attain through their activity.

To this effect, Aristotle spells out his methodology to us. Much like a doctor gains true knowledge of health in humans by examining many individuals and carrying out studies, so shall Aristotle go about his investigation to trace out the highest and most divine in us and how we can manifest it through our actions.

Aristotle contrasts his methodology to the approach of e.g. a priest. The priest presupposes the existence of an abstract God everywhere and in everything, then retroactively finds reasons to justify his views. Aristotle finds this impractical and unsuited for this investigation.

**Chapter 7 - The experience of living life as a human**

So far, we have established that the highest good is (i) the immediate goal of politics and the one thing at which all activities aim, (ii) some thing we desire purely for its own sake which we can comprehend and attain for ourselves, (iii) sufficient to itself without the need of something else to complete it, (iv) equivalent to happiness and the welfare of humans.

That being said, Aristotle recognises that the conclusion ""happiness is the highest good in humans"" only makes sense if we understand (i) what happiness means and (ii) where we can locate it in the human experience. To this effect, Aristotle asks us to presuppose that humans have a ""telos"", a purpose in the world exclusive to them. He limits the search to what is uniquely human. Thus, as he sketches out the parts of the experience of living the life of a human for us, we exclude: (a) nutrition and growth and (b) sense-perception which we share with other living organisms and pursue the highest good in what is exclusive to us (c) our ability to reason (as in think) and act in accordance with our reason.

We conclude with Aristotle that our path to the highest good begins with the coordination of thought and action. Every night, before going to sleep, let us spend a few minutes becoming conscious of our actions during the day and visualise the ways in which we could act better the next day. Let us contemplate our actions and then act according to the conclusions of our contemplation.

Much like a ballet dancer or a karateka practice various moves and stances until they can reproduce them naturally, so does Aristotle believe that the virtues he offers in this work are the forms which constitute the path to this most excellent way. The way Aristotle wants us to treat virtues is not like magic stones that we can carry around like a necklace for good luck. He offers them to us as blueprints of excellence which we can contemplate on in order to calibrate our actions, a guide to reaching the highest good.

Reflecting on the words of Aristotle, we may ask ourselves what parts of our daily lives, i.e. the sum of our actions everyday, we are not conscious of. Let us take a closer look at our routine everyday. How do we spend our time and energy? Does the image of ourselves we carry inside us correspond to the image we put out there in the world? Do our thoughts correlate with our actions? Aristotle, time and again, implies that we should ask ourselves these questions.

**Chapter 8 -** **Will and Representation**

Reason is not mere thinking. Reason is a methodical activity of thought through which we negotiate a bridge between our self – the source of our “I am” – and the world surrounding us, i.e. everything and everyone we are not. Through our reason, we make sense of the experiences we apprehend with our senses – we digest them as Nietzsche suggested – and produce representations which we take upon ourselves and integrate. In this case, a representation might be an opinion, a belief, an understanding of how something works. The sum of these representations forms our view of the world. Otherwise stated, our worldview is (a representation of) the world integrated into us. Through our world view, as a second movement, we return to integrate ourselves in the world and find our place in it.

Much like a tree sprouts forth branches laden with leaves in order to access as much sunlight as possible and prosper, we – using our worldview as a backdrop – will forth, i.e. carry out, activities which we believe will lead us to a place of prosperity. In other words, our worldview helps us answer the question “how do I prosper?” It becomes a mold into which we pour our will as molten liquid which then solidifies as our activities and actions.

Once we follow this train of thought to its conclusion, we find that the way to the most prosperous life is the one in which we cultivate the most capable and sophisticated self and develop a view of the world which is the closest possible to how the world really works and is. Aristotle deeply understands that amidst the hustle and bustle of opinions, beliefs and ideas, we can only hold “our knowledge” of the world accountable to our reality as living humans, biological organisms on planet Earth. He discerns that one of the keys to reaching true knowledge and ultimately achieving a state of prosperity is by cultivating our reasoning faculty and grounding it to human reality. Towards this goal, Aristotle systematises dialectical inquiry and in the process invents logic. Once we finish with the Nicomachean Ethics, we will continue with the Organon.

**Chapter 9 - Politics at all levels**

Aristotle restates that our highest good, this state of prosperity exclusive to humans Aristotle calls eudaimonia, we reach best not as isolated individuals but as a community through political activity.

At this point, let us note that in Aristotle's Politics, the philosopher underlines that the *de facto* aim of most politicians is to preserve the structures which they think keep them in power that ""the good of the people"" merely serves as a *de jure* justification for the power politicians hold in the first place. Perhaps, then, a good way to interpret this would be this:

Aristotle asks us to become conscious of what of the political in our life is within our control. We definitely want to associate ourselves with communities and individuals which will help and enable us to grow and thrive with them. At the level of country, the early twentieth century taught us that if the politics of your country smashes the windows of your shops and terrorises you, you move to another country. At the level of family and friends, we know that if your friend just spends all your time together gloating about how great they are and every time you want to say or do something they cut you off... well you take control and cut the saboteurs off, then find better friends. Thus, the active or political life Aristotle proposes is one in which we strive to become aware of all the things we can change in our life to our best advantage and take action.

**Chapter 10 - Adversity and Eudaimonia**

However many the days of sunshine and calm, the time will come when we will have to weather a serious storm. It is during these times of adversity, Aristotle reminds us, that the right outlook of the world paired with the right habits can serve us a solid ground and help us confront and navigate the difficult time in the most appropriate way as opposed to succumbing to it or engaging in denial.

Happy we may thus qualify the person who shows the above-described disposition in their day to day life.

**Chapter 11 - Friends and death**

In the same vein, as we become more competent and strengthen our sense of self, we start to build our own grounds for our existence. We shed dysfunctional relationships of codependency and start resonating with people on a similar path to our own. They become our allies and friends. On the day of our death, our allies will resist using our name to some vainglory nor will they dishonour us by straying from their path to excellence but keep our memory close to their heart and struggle onwards.

**Chapter 12 - Definition is important**

The language in which we describe the world contains the logic we use to understand it. Thus, if we make mistakes in the way we talk about something, this is a clear tell that we also misconceptualise it and ultimately misunderstand it. Aristotle, in this way, cautions us about the way we can speak about what he terms eudaimonia and we translate as happiness in order to draw our attention and make us more conscious of what it is: A first principle, complete in itself and to be prized, for the sake of which we engage in all other activities.

**Chapter 13 - (A) A politician’s role**

When it comes to problems of physical or psychological health, there exists a tendency in the culture today to view medical treatment as an isolated operation limited to the individual patient. A farmer, on the other hand, knows that a rich crop yield depends not only on the condition of the seed but also on the quality of the grounds on which he scatters the seed. Following this mindset, Aristotle views the politician as tasked with ensuring the state as a space in which the citizens find the environment necessary to grow both physically and psychologically healthy and also to thrive and lead prosperous lives.

**(B) On the Soul**

To this effect, Aristotle sketches his outline of the structure of the soul. First, Aristotle distinguishes two elements as making up the soul: (i) one rational and (ii) another irrational. Now, the irrational element Aristotle further divides into (a) the nutritive or vegetative part which regulates our body and its growth as well as (b) the appetitive or desiring part which compels us to pursue our desires. We observe, here, that the nutritive and appetitive parts are paired together as the irrational element of the soul because they have no reason in themselves. The difference, however, between the two is that the appetitive part has the potential to be calibrated by reason and in this capacity partakes in the rational element of the soul as well.

**(C) The two kinds of virtue**

Finally, Aristotle lays his schema of the virtues over his schema of the rational element of the soul. Just as one part of the rational element of the soul is the reason-carrying part, i.e. it has reason in itself and the other part is the desiring part which as we mentioned before can be calibrated by reason so do we have:

(i) intellectual virtues which deal with developing our capacity to reason

(ii) virtues of character which deal with shaping our desires and habits according to reason
