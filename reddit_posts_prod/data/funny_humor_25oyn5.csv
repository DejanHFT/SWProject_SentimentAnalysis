[Experiment] Remove posts that make no attempt at humor,brownboy13,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/25oyn5/experiment_remove_posts_that_make_no_attempt_at/,488,2268,"Greetings complainers (and the five of you that haven't complained so far). We've had a long stance of not judging content in order to maintain objectivity. We've heard a *[little](http://i.imgur.com/hFBVycx.gif)* bit of criticism about this. So today, we're introducing a temporary rule, based on a fair bit of user feedback. We'll be enforcing it for a few weeks and see what the reaction of the ~~unwashed masses~~ subscriber base is before we decide on whether to make it permanent, extend it or scrap it.

NEW RULE: Posts that make no attempt at humor will be removed.

What this means is that if you posted something in /r/funny because of the size of the subscriber base, or because /r/reddit.com isn't an option, your post is most likely going to be removed.

We can't see every submission, so we ask that users report such submissions. Please remember that only submissions that make **NO ATTEMPT** at humor should be reported. Offensive humor, antijokes and bad jokes are still allowed. Don't report those.

Signed,

~~The luftwaffe~~/r/funny mods
