'John Wick 3' - Review Thread,BunyipPouch,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/bn02h4/john_wick_3_review_thread/,527,1272,"Review embargo just lifted for John Wick 3. It's still early but they're realllllly good so far, most calling it the best in the series. Looks like this'll be a fitting end to the trilogy. I could see this opening to $40M+ now with 95%+ on Rotten Tomatoes based on early reviews.
