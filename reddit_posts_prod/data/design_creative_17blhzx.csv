Courses to reignite the creativity and describe my decisions.,alexjericho13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/17blhzx/courses_to_reignite_the_creativity_and_describe/,4,2,"I am working as a designer for 4 years already and one year and a half on my current job. On my current position I am doing a lot of pretty mechanical work with a little to none of creativity. But now our team is starting to make a new project on which I need to be more creative. Like, my manager said that I am doing good work technically, but now I need to find a way to work more free, and most of all, learn to describe my design decisions, learn to “sell” my design. Currently I’m a bit struggling with it, often answering like “I’ve done it because… I’ve decided to do it like that”. So my question is - is there any books, lectures, videos or courses which can help me?"
