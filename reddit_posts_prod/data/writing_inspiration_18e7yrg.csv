any books that got you into writing/inspire you to write?,Previous-Stay-912,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18e7yrg/any_books_that_got_you_into_writinginspire_you_to/,15,1,"i love writing and have so many ideas but iâ€™m being held back by my limited knowledge of actual techniques that can only be learned through reading. i have trouble staying focused on the pages (if that makes sense) which has stopped me from reading i think, so im looking into trying audiobooks. anyway im looking for books that really inspired yall to start writing or have helped you to hone your craft. iâ€™m into any genre but i enjoy mostly fantasy, horror, thriller, romance, anything with one or more of those themes. but if you have any recommendations outside iâ€™d love to hear it!
