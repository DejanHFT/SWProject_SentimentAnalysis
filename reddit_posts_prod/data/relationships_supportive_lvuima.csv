My [19F] ex-partner [19M] and his overly supportive friend [19M]: How I should proceed?,iamconfused00,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lvuima/my_19f_expartner_19m_and_his_overly_supportive/,2,2,"My boyfriend broke up with me a month ago. We had a relationship that lasted for two months, online only. I said something wrong that triggers his past anxieties and we had a big series of fights. We decided that we need time and will try to get back in our relationship or stay as friends at some point. However, it was a breakup and I had declining mental health. Out of the blue, one of his best friends I only talked once before contacted me and said that he wanted to be there for me during this awful time because my ex told him that I'm not doing really well and he couldn't help me with it at that point.

I was a mess for the first weeks. Every day, the friend checked up on me and was there with me during my darkest moments. After something my ex did that I considered disrespectful, I told the friend that I am almost ready to move on. That day, and the following week, the friend and I had almost 8 hours long conversations via texting every day. Almost none of those convos included my ex and we were getting to know each other.

At some point, our conversations became more intimate in a way that we were talking about hugging, cuddling, nose and cheek kisses and sleeping on each other's laps. He was being very protective, sweet, caring and kind. However, I was still not sure if he was being friendly or not but I already had a crush on him and I was too happy to protest.

One day, my ex whom I only communicate via superficial convos and memes after the breakup, called me while he was drunk. I said I'll get drunk too to accompany him. We started to talk about our relationship and told him that I wanted him back. He screamed at me and he told me he still loved me but we cannot try again now. At some point, I confessed to him that I fell for someone else. He said ""good for you"" and ""it's okay"". We somehow hang up saying 'love you's.

The day after, I told the friend that I am completely done with my ex and am ready to move on completely. The friend, obviously, told my ex about my decision. My ex texted me, apologised and told me that he wanted me around but he cannot stop me if I wanted to leave. I said I needed time to answer that.

Today I wrote to the friend and told him that it was not nice of him to directly telling my ex what I thought and that it broke my heart. The friend told me that he was confused because my ex told him that I wanted to get back together. I simply stated that I was drunk and wanted to try one last time. I also emphasized that his being rude to me showed me that we can never be together again. He said he was confused again and was trying to fix communication issues between my ex and me. I told him that I'll tell my ex that we can only be friends from now on. I also added that even if I was mad at the friend too, I didn't want to lose him ever. He apologised and accepted that he should've asked me first before telling my ex about my decision but insisted he did it for our good.

This is an overwhelming and confusing summary of what happened. I am already convinced that I should let my ex go and move on. However, I still want to think that I have a chance with the friend but I am not sure that I can trust him anymore. I am not even sure he is into me either.

Can I trust and have something romantic with the friend? Should I let them both go and turn the page in my life? I am utterly confused and I need help.

**TL;DR: I broke up with my boyfriend, one of his best friends supported me during that time. We got close but didn't pass a certain line. When I wanted to move on, he leaked my decision to my ex. I got mad but forgave him. Should I move on from them or should I discover my chance with the friend? Do I even have a shot with the friend anyway?**"
