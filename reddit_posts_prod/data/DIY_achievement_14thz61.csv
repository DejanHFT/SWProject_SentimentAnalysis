Water/rodent proofing a storage bench?,OwnFunction5788,https://i.redd.it/0wsuty9dolab1.jpg,0,1,"I have an Ã¤ngso outdoor wooden storage bench from ikea that I'd like to put hinges on, as well as seal in the interior to keep out rain and rodents.

Anyone got any tips on what materials to use to achieve this? Would a wire mesh pinning a heavy gauge plastic sheeting with weather stripping work perhaps?"
