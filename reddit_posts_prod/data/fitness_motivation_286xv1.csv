Is there a weird source that motivates you to work out?,Defttone,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/286xv1/is_there_a_weird_source_that_motivates_you_to/,1205,764,"While doctors orders and just wanting to feel/look better are good they are not what i mean. 


I started off because my legs gave out when i was sprinting away from my opponents in flag football the embarassment made me go back into the gym. 



My ex-gf motivating me by cheating on me with a fat gross looking prick. When she did that i worked out hard to show her she messed up and lost a great thing she had in her life.



My last reason was because of the military, i want to be beyond ready for boot camp.



My current reason is because i want to be better than those around me. I want to be bigger faster and stronger. 



What ever the reason my goals stay the same, so what are yours? Vain or not what are they? 


My weird reason: i want to be able to carry all the fucking groceries in at once...this one is getting really close to being an achievement.

June 16th, 2014 update: Thank you all for your comments, ive read a lot and responded to a few, so far i have found Ex bf or gfs seem to be a big reason to get fit, next is depression, then illnesses of sorts. My cake day was last week but this more than made up for it. Again thank you all for your comments I will continue to read and respond :)"
