Screenplay opinions? (novice writer looking for critiques),xpurplehayes,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/nage0/screenplay_opinions_novice_writer_looking_for/,1,1,"This is a screenplay about a boy who has been cut off from society for his entire life, and what habits he forms on his own. It isn't written in typical form, it is basically just a short book that is incredibly over descriptive and has cinematography notes. all of the text in bold is commentary by the boy all though im not sure weather I'm going to include that at he end or not. It isn't anywhere near done, i only just started writing it, and i will continue, but i want to know your opinions! here is the word doc. Hey i just wrote this, and it isn't nearly done yet, and it isn't even in correct format or anything, it is really just an over descriptive short story with notes about cinematography. all the text in bold is narration, which i am on the fence of whether or not to include. please tell me your thoughts. like i said i am nowhere near done. http://mediafire.com/?ngtl2did1i284ov"
