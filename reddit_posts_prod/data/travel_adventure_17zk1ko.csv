G Adventures vs. Intrepid,SufficientAd2514,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17zk1ko/g_adventures_vs_intrepid/,18,2,"Both companies have a 50-60 day trip through Africa that I’m interested in, but G Adventures is about $3000 cheaper. I have traveled with Intrepid 3 times and have been pretty happy, so I’m wondering if anyone who has done tours with both groups can compare the experience"
