Why was double entry book keeping such an important historical development?,deadant88,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/rms42n/why_was_double_entry_book_keeping_such_an/,310,1973,"Hi,

I’m really interested in Renaissance history - have read a number of books on the Medici and Renaissance Europe. Often one of the big catalysts cited for the Renaissance was the innovation of Double Entry bookkeeping which, correct me if I’m wrong, really supercharged the merchant cities of Italy and, in particular, Florence. In turn this lead to the families like the Medici amassing fortunes that they could pour into civic, scientific and cultural development.

Im curious to know more about Double Entry Book keeping, what it replaced and why it was such a game changer.

Feel free to correct my take on its role in the Renaissance as well!"
