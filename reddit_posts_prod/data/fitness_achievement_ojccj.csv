Achievement and embarrassment unlocked,spinozasrobot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ojccj/achievement_and_embarrassment_unlocked/,16,0,"So I accidentally hit an interim goal today, I benched a plate (2.5 months into SS).

I started my normal routine but didn't realize I had racked 45 lb a side instead of my usual 40.  After the first set of 5, I thought I was having a bad day when I realized what I had done.

So then I was psyched and pushed out the 2nd set.  After that, I started the third when I made a critical mistake.

On the last rep of the 3rd set, I relaxed the tension in my arms.  As soon as the bar rested on my chest, I knew I was in trouble.  There was no way I was going to get that bar up again.

So there I was, wondering how the hell I was going to handle it when the trainer I work with once a week just happened to walk by.  I asked for help reracking it, but I sure did feel pretty dumb.

Anyway, I guess I should look at the bright side, I (almost) got to my goal of benching a plate 3x5, and I didn't injure anything but my pride."
