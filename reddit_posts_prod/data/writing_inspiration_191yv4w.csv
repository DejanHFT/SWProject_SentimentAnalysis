Inspiration/but not source material. Snatch from movies & shows,Critical_Gap3794,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/191yv4w/inspirationbut_not_source_material_snatch_from/,2,0,"   I see that watching a tv show here or there may give ideas. Problem is, reality is reality, and a show is a show. First example:
Never to my knowledge have the police ever used tape or chalk to mark or delineate where and in what position and how many bodies there were at a crime scene. It is a writer's device ( a really good one too ).

Thus i segue . Star Trek, love the franchise. Stargate, huge fan. This said, the 2 are different on that Gene Roddenberry knew if lasees were used, then viewees would always complain "" lasers don't do that""
phasers entered, giving writer's license.

SG one, takes for too much license with physics.

Astrophysicist reacts to Stargate SG-1 ""A Matter of Time"" - wormholes, black hole...

Scientists confabulating a wormhole and black hole.
Having Red Giant eaten by tiny.black hole.
Just lots of junk scince and discontinuity.

  The best, was the first.
Isaac Asimov's Night Fall. He blended extreme low tech with science fiction

  If he had continued the story after the third sun went out, there would have been a reader riot.

   So, firstly decide how much verity to reality you want, how much artistic license.
 Let your reader know, they are in for a mister toad ride.

  For me, I am finding a firm commitment to reality based is confining my.*latitude.
   As I currently write this post I see the need to break with a non-fiction world with propoganda to convince everyone of monsters, and enter a story second half where the implausible is the authentic fact in world.

   How do you handle science research for authenticity, balanced with writer's license?
 Q: is it even an issue for you or is this a ME thing?"
