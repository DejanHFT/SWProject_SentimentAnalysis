My boyfriend [35M] was not supportive of my [23F] efforts to seek justice for myself (Xpost TwoXChromosomes),closetotears87,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2krg7a/my_boyfriend_35m_was_not_supportive_of_my_23f/,42,73,"Honestly I don't even know why I'm posting here, but I feel really lonely just sitting here sad with my boyfriend asleep in the other room.

A couple of years ago I was assaulted by a fitness trainer at a private gym.  I wasn't thinking straight and didn't call the cops afterward, afraid that nobody would believe me since I didn't have any physical evidence.  Tried to just erase it from my mind.  Didn't work, obviously.  It's taken a huge toll on me, to the point that I have serious depression and anxiety.

I finally got the courage to start going to therapy (just started a couple of months ago) and have begun trying to work through everything.  We talked about how perpetrators usually have multiple victims.  I went home and searched his name, curious if anyone else had made a similar complaint.  I read that he had been arrested for raping a sixteen-year-old girl at his gym, and another girl had come forward also.  (The article was dated from two years ago, and I couldn't find any information as to what happened afterward -- nothing comes up when I search the sex offender databases).

Obviously I feel horrendous guilt that I never said anything, and he went on to hurt other people.  That's something I'm working through in therapy, but I also want to do the right thing (as much as possible after all this time).  The article said that there was some evidence at the gym -- apparently he filmed secretly, so it's possible that there's something to corroborate my story.  It also gave the email of the detective to contact with any information.

I've been drafting an email to send to that detective, which I just sent tonight.  I basically said that I realize a lot of time has passed, and there may be nothing I can do that's helpful, but I felt that I needed to at least offer up my help if there was anything I could do that could keep him behind bars.  Realistically there's probably not much I can do, and I know that, but I extended out my story.  It was hard to do, and upsetting.

My boyfriend is aware that the incident happened, but it was before we were together (we've been dating 1.5 years, and the assault was in early 2011).  I haven't spoken about it in great detail, but he knows the gist.  

I told him tonight that I had taken a difficult step and sent the email, and asked him to read it to see if I expressed myself clearly.  He refused, saying he was tired, and said ""Maybe tomorrow"".  Then he went and got in bed, even though I was visibly upset and close to crying.  When I went in a few minutes later (he was still awake and the light was on), I told him I wanted some words of encouragement, and that I felt he had been dismissive of a situation that was important to me.  He didn't say anything, just half-heartedly rubbed my arm.  

I couldn't take it and got up and went out to the living room to comfort myself on the couch.  He came out a few minutes later, and said something about how I needed to stop thinking about it and come to bed.  I told him I wasn't going to be able to fall asleep, and he went back to bed without me.

I understand being tired, but this was a HUGE step for me, and I feel both proud and devastated, and scared that I'll get a mean email in response about how useless I am at this point.  I really need some sort of encouragement, and my boyfriend just went and passed out.  Usually he's very supportive, but I'm super disappointed and feel very alone right now.

To be fair, he doesn't like to talk about serious stuff late at night, but I know that if he was upset and needed me, I would at least make an effort to be comforting even if I was tired.

How do I talk about this?  I already told him I felt dismissed, and got dismissed again.  Just want to sit here and cry for a while.


*Tl;dr*: Prepared an email to a police detective to see what I can do about an assault that happened a couple of years ago.  Boyfriend didn't want to talk about it, hurt my feelings.

*UPDATE*:

Thanks for the advice and kind words.  I think I should clarify -- my boyfriend is usually very sensitive and compassionate, and not at ALL the type to usually dismiss my feelings, which is why I was really thrown off by this.  He's helped me through other issues in my life, and is very much my rock and #1 supporter (which is why this was so hurtful).  He is a very mature, steady, responsible person -- and not at all interested in me because of the difference in our ages (it was initially his main concern when we started dating).  I am absolutely not trying to make him out as a bad guy at all, and I'm sorry if it came across that way.  I was just really upset with how our communication went in this case, which happens in every relationship at some point.

He sat down on the bed before he left for work this morning and asked how I was doing, and kissed and cuddled me.  He said he had been extremely tired, and since this hadn't come up until late at night, he wasn't really in the best place to offer the support I needed.  He told me he knew I was doing the right thing.  I told him I didn't need a lot from him, just some cuddles or comforting words would have sufficed.  I'm going to try to be more clear about what I want in the future."
