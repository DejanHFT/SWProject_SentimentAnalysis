what does fittit do to keep motivated?,sheekthecris,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/d3enh/what_does_fittit_do_to_keep_motivated/,91,10,"I've recently lost all motivation to workout, i'll still knock out the odd gym sesh, but i'm way down from my previous 6 day workout routine(chest/back day, arms/shoulders day and leg day twice each a week). i haven't seen improvement for quite some time but i'm still way off my goals. i had been at it for about a year, trying to build more than anything (i'm 21, 6'6'' and 210lbs). I was also thinking of changing my workout routine to try and get myself back into it if anyone has any suggestions, but mainly looking to motivate myself.
thanks in advance"
