"The Human Genome Project cost $2.7 billion. 20 years later, it costs <$1000 to sequence the genome. Was the cost of the project fundamentally necessary for subsequent progress, or could we have ""waited"" for the technology to become cheaper?",Ziddletwix,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/hpt7ab/the_human_genome_project_cost_27_billion_20_years/,420,12773,"I'm very much a clueless layman, but I'm learning about genetics for the first time. I don't mean this in any sort of combative way–the Human Genome Project had countless benefits that we can't possibly track, and I'd imagine $2.7 billion is a trifle compared to its broader impact. 

My question is just narrowly about the way that genome sequencing has dropped rapidly in cost. Was it fundamentally necessary to first use these exorbitantly pricey methods, which provided the foundation for the future research which would make it affordable? Or are the two questions inherently separate: the Human Genome Project gave us a first, initial glimpse at our mapped out genome, and then a decade later separate technological developments would make that same task much cheaper (as is commonly the case in science and technology).

The ""could we have waited"" in the title is probably misleading–I really don't mean any sort of  value judgment (the project sounds enormously important), I purely mean ""could"" in a narrow hypothetical (not, ""would it have been a good idea to wait"", which I highly doubt)."
