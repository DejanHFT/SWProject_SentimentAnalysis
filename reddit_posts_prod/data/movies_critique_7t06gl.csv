What the hell even was The Player(1992)? Did the writer just throw a big meta-Hollywood-critique curveball at the audience? [Spoilers],thatdani,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7t06gl/what_the_hell_even_was_the_player1992_did_the/,10,0,"I just finished watching Robert Altman's [The Player](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105151/?ref_=nm_knf_i1) and I literally don't know what to think of it.

After the first 30 minutes or so, what appeared to be the plot of the film basically fell flat on its face. So the first question I have is, was *that* the ""second act that doesn't exist"" that Griffin mentioned regarding the fake movie? Or does it just play with the audience's expectations of the plot.

Second, the relationship between Griffin and June was presented so strangely, it must've been on purpose. But can anybody help me out about why? Is it again a critique of how most female love interests were written as hollow characters who just exist as a continuation of the main character?

Third, what was with the strange camera work in this film? The extreme zooming on Tim Robbins' face, the following of unimportant objects/extras, the shot of the lunch meeting being taken from in front of Burt Reynolds' table, etc. Was Robert Altman parodying/paying homage to trademark shots of other directors or what?

Fourth - the overall tone. Were they going for such a subtle satire, that they wanted to keep it creepy and thrillery until the very end? Like a 95% bait, 5% switch, up until the line-up scene? 

I mean, the part with the actual stalker at the end not even being shown on screen and not being given any actual significance, that I actually got. It's there to wrap the plot nicely in a circle, and at the same time it's a gag on how the audience still expect to see the ""villain"" and for him to be given importance to the story.

And finally, what the actual fuck was that first police interrogation scene. I could not understand what to feel - amused at the ridiculousness, tense for the main character or creeped out by the cops?

So for the people who actually understand this movie - please comment your thoughts/interpretations so I can read them in the morning.

Thanks!

PS. My GOD the number of cameos...That must've been a record at some point.
