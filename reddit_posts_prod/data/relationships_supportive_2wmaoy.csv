My [42F] Daughter [17F] just came out to me as mtf transgender. I am fully supportive and am seeking some guidance on next steps.,humanpersonwoman,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2wmaoy/my_42f_daughter_17f_just_came_out_to_me_as_mtf/,184,912,"This morning, my daughter handed my husband and I letter before she left for school. A little background first - she's been extremely depressed recently, so a few months back my husband and I helped her find a good therapist to go talk to. She finally found one she was comfortable with, and things have been looking up. Last night, she sat my husband and I down and wanted to open up to us about a few things. However, she was so nervous and upset that she struggled to find her words and ended up breaking down and crying. I consoled her and suggested that she write us a letter to make the first steps of opening up about whatever she needed to talk about a bit easier. 

The letter she wrote was absolutely heart-breaking. I had no idea that she had been dealing with feelings of gender dysphoria for nearly her entire life, and as a parent, I feel so fucking guilty that she's been dealing with this alone. 

My husband and I love her to pieces and will obviously be giving her any kind of support she needs. My questions to reddit is what are our next steps as parents? Do we sit back and wait until she comes to us for help with something specific? Should we look into special therapy/support groups to help her (and us) cope with her dysphoria? We just want to make sure that we're as gentle and caring as possible. 
   
tl;dr My daughter came out as mtf transgender and my husband and I want to be the best support system we can be. What's next?


Update: Wow...I woke up to way more comments and pieces of wonderful advice than I anticipated. Thank you, thank you, thank you! First off, my husband and I wanted to text our daughter, but she broke her phone about a week ago (thank goodness for warranties) and we're waiting for the new one to ship. We thought about calling her friend's house phone just to reassure her that we got her letter and she shouldn't be afraid to come home or anything like that, but realized that might be ""embarrassing"" for a teenager. We're currently awaiting her arrival home and are doing some more research in the mean time - particularly into the cultures of the colleges she's applied to. Last night we had a hard time sleeping and ended up binge-watching a series on youtube called ""True Trans"" by a transitioning musician named Laura Jane Grace from the band Against Me. This peaked our interest because our daughter loves this band and has their posters and records all over her room. Watching the series was a mixture of informative, heart-breaking, insightful, scary, and calming. As parents, it's hard not to get lost in worry for what our daughter's future will hold. It's so scary to know that she'll face so much ignorance and hatred throughout her entire transition, and probably throughout the rest of her life. However, at the same time, I'm so happy that my child will finally start to feel like themselves and will start to gain a true identity. I could burst with happiness and fear all at once right now. Again - thanks to reddit for being so helpful and so kind. Will post another update in time.
