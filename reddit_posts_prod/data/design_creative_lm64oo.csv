CREATIVE OPPORTUNITY - Charity Magazine,extrasmallheinz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/lm64oo/creative_opportunity_charity_magazine/,0,1,"Recently I was reflecting on the past year now that the anniversary is nearing from when the UK first went into lockdown. This has been a very lonely time for most, especially the elderly members of our community. 

With this in mind I came up with the idea to create and sell a magazine to raise money for the charity Age UK. This magazine will be full of creativeâ€™s work all based around the theme Lockdown.

There are no limits or boundaries for what can be submitted to this magazine but I would really appreciate if you could share this with anybody who enjoys:

* Graphic Design
* Photography
* Product Design
* Writing (Poems/Creative/Songwriting)
* Interior Design
* Fine Art
* \+ more.
