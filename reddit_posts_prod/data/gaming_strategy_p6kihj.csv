Peaceful Strategy Games for Builders?,JoeChristmasUSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/p6kihj/peaceful_strategy_games_for_builders/,24,5,"Anyone know any peaceful strategy games? I'm a bit old-school in my gaming tastes and I love strategy games like Age of Empires, Rise of Nations, and Civilization. I especially enjoy when games have peaceful win conditions and let me build cool bases, settlements, and cities. So many of these types of RTS/4-X style games end in fast-paced military blow-ups and that's fun but I'm looking for a game where I can win by building instead of destroying. I prefer historical settings but that's not mandatory. Any recommendations?"
