Why does Pan's labyrinth have only good critiques?,TyForAllTheFish,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a02ais/why_does_pans_labyrinth_have_only_good_critiques/,13,0,"Just watched Pan's Labyrinth for the first time and I have to point out I watched it in german, but first thing I have to say I did not like the dialogues at all. They just sound bad in my ears.
Second point I have to make is the character building epecially Vidal. The scene with the farmer and his son where he kills them both and only afterwards finds the rabbits feels like its just there to push this image of a sadistic, cold-hearted general, but to me he feels like a caricature. Did I miss something or is just the german version right up bad?"
