**A Prologue and defining Terms**

Much like Socrates in Plato‘s Phaedrus, I would like to begin this effort by defining important terms. In modern English, the word „wisdom“ carries many connotations which for the purposes of understanding Aristotle are not useful at all. Instead, in order to (i) stick to the concept Aristotle puts forward and (ii) give this concept a mystical appeal, I will be using the word „sophia“. I will tentatively attribute it the meaning „the highest level of knowledge“.

Now, for „techne“ I will go with the English word „art“ and give it the tentative meaning „a principled set of skills“ and for „episteme“ I will go with the word „science“ as in „a principled system of understanding“. For „aitiai“ I will stick with the popular „causes“, though understand it as „explanations.“

Moving forward, I am getting the impression that this book (at least partially) proceeds from the „Ethics“ and is like a twin to the „Politics“. Where „Politics“ deals with the political life, the „Metaphysics“ will deal with the contemplative life as we find it in the 10th book of the „Ethics“.

**Chapter 1 - Sophia as the highest level of knowledge**

**(a) General introduction** We humans have a natural disposition to learning. Through our senses (e.g. sight, hearing etc.), we gather memories. As we collect memories of doing a particular thing (e.g. ride a bicycle), we gain experience. We become better at it. As our experience in a particular activity grows, we start holding different notions (e.g. I have difficulty braking after it rains.) From these notions, we then infer universals (e.g. it is hard to brake on wet surfaces.) Across many universals, as we develop a deep understanding of this activity, we come to acquire it as an art.

Now, just learning the universals of some activity, i.e. the theory behind it, is not sufficient to learn it properly. We absolutely need hands-on experience for that. Conversely, just gaining experience in doing something will help us better reproduce that activity but it won‘t teach us its inner workings. Thus, gaining experience in some activity and learning the theory behind it are both important pieces of becoming skilled in it, an artisan.

e.g. „I can‘t learn how to ride a bike by watching Youtube videos. Learning, however, ways to maintain proper bike riding form will prevent future injuries.“

**(b)** Beginning from farthest to closest, **Aristotle‘s ladder of sophia** is (i) sensation, (ii) memory, (iii) experience, (iv) productive arts and sciences, (v) theoretical arts and sciences. Sophia, as Aristotle terms it, is the highest level of knowledge and deals with certain causes and principles.

**Chapter 2 – The qualifications of the highest science** Which then is the highest science, the science in pursuit of sophia? Aristotle lays down a number of notions to help us navigate this question: (i) It is a science pursued for its own sake and not as a means to something else. Thus, (ii) it is not a productive science, i.e. it does not deal with the necessities of life. Instead, (iii) it seeks the knowledge most universal and by extension most abstract and farthest away from the senses. In other words, it researches the first principles \*(how things are done)\* and causes \*(why they are done)\*. Therefore, if it attempts to provide us with the correct answers to these primordial questions \*(of how and why things are done)\*, (iv) it is the highest and most authoritative of sciences.

**Chapter 3 - Aristotle‘s standard of measuring high science** Aristotle announces his intention to use his doctrine of the four causes as a standard with which he will measure the level of science of his predecessors. He then sets out to provide a summary historical account of the thinkers he deems important. **(a) the doctrine of the four causes** Aristotle sets forth that in order to truly know something, we must be able to provide 4 types of explanation about it. These we popularly know as the 4 causes:

(1) the material cause - What something is made of – e.g. this table is made of wood

(2) the efficient cause – How it came to existence – e.g. the carpenter made it

(3) the formal cause – The structure of its form and becoming – e.g. the table design blueprint

(4) the final cause – The function it fulfils – e.g. it‘s a dining table

**(b) A historical account** Here, Aristotle begins to treat on previous thinkers who sought explanations to the most abstract and universal matters. For the remainder of this chapter, he examines the cases of thinkers who settled only for a material cause. It is interesting to note that these thinkers maintained an elemental precursor of the law of conservation of energy.

**Chapter 4 - hints of efficient cause** Aristotle looks into the cases of thinkers who entertained both a material cause and an efficient cause (Anaxagoras, Empedocles i.a.). We note that they dealt mostly with corporeal elements such as earth, water, fire, air. They also introduced concepts such as nous, love, friendship & strife to treat on the efficient cause but only tangentially and not systematically.

**Chapter 5 - (a) math over matter** The Pythagoreans developed the idea that the entire universe emanated from the monad(1) and was arranged on a musical scale. All things thus subsisted of numbers and were based on mathematics. They introduced 10 principles in the form of pairs of opposition: (i) limit and unlimited, (ii) odd and even, (iii) one and many, (iv) right and left, (v) male and female, (vi) resting and moving, (vii) straight and curved, (viii) light and darkness, (ix) good and evil, (x) square and oblong. **(b) monism** The Eleatics, spearheaded by Parmenides treat the entire universe as one entity, the one. They damn human perception as faulty for perceiving it as an assembly of many different things.

**Chapter 6 - the world of the forms** Plato built upon his predecessors and put a more sophisticated system forward. Influenced by the thought of Heraclitus, he considered the perceptible world, i.e. all things that can be apprehended through the senses, to be everchanging, in a constant state of flux and impossible for humans to fathom. Be that as it may, he was also a student of Socrates. He learned the dialectic as a method of apprehending things with the mind, defining them, acquiring fixed knowledge of them.

As a next step, Plato put mind over matter. He conceived a noetic world parallel and superordinate to the material one. In that world all things exist as noetic forms, ideas and are fixed, thus affording humans the possibility to gain knowledge of them. He posited that all idea forms proceeded from the idea of the highest good and, in turn, that all material things came to be by participating in their respective idea forms. In the Platonic system, mathematics was viewed as an intermediate between the two worlds.

**Chapter 7 – a critical account** So far, Aristotle has been primarily descriptive of his predecessors and critical only in passing. Here, he broadcasts his intention to provide a more thorough evaluation of the thought of previous thinkers.

**Chapter 8 – Critique of natural philosophers and the Pythagoreans**

**(a) natural philosophers** They only focus on corporeal elements and sense-perceptible nature, hardly ever on anything incorporeal. Their thinking is limited to arguments about generation, destruction and movement. **(b) the Pythagoreans** Like the natural philosophers, the Pythagoreans only focus on the sense-perceptible world. Nevertheless, their application of mathematics opens the door to considering higher realms of reality.

**Chapter 9 -Critique of Plato and Platonism**

**(a) confronting Plato** In the face of Plato‘s theory of the world of the forms, Aristotle chains together a long sequence of lines of refutative arguments which demonstrate that: (i) attempts to systematise the theory so far all fall through, (ii) the forms themselves yield no scientific knowledge, (iii) attempts to characterise the forms as pattern, substance, numbers etc. all fall through. **(b) not top-down but bottom-up** Aristotle concludes this chapter by emphasising that we should neither prioritise the sense-perceptible material world (like most presocratics) nor hold prejudices against it (like e.g. Plato). Rather, as Aristotle mentions at the beginning of this book, we should use the sensory experiences and observations we make of what we have before us (Physics) as a basis to proceed to the most abstract universals and develop our minds to the level where can start fathoming sophia itself.

**Chapter 10 -conclusion of critique** Aristotle concludes the historical and critical account of his predecessors.
