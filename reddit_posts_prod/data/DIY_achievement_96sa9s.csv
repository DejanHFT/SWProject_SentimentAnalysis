Still trying to achieve proper air circulation throughout apartment,Elarionus,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/96sa9s/still_trying_to_achieve_proper_air_circulation/,14,3,"I drew a diagram of where I'm at right now. I have both bathroom doors closed, as well as the laundry room door, as the only rooms we're super interested in getting cooled off are our bedrooms.

I originally had the fans sitting in the windows pointing inward whenever it felt colder outside, and outward whenever it felt warmer outside (I'm not sure if this is actually how fans work). Now though, it seems to be much cooler inside, or at least not as musty and uncomfortable. I will gladly accept suggestions and theories on how to get it to work better. I've done some research on it, but most things I've found are to supplement an air conditioner. There is no air conditioning in this apartment. :P
