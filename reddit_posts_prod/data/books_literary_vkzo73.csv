Literary Critics?,Benjals0722,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vkzo73/literary_critics/,18,32,"Hello all. I’m a huge cinephile and while I’ve always enjoyed reading, I’ve found myself to really be getting into it now. (17 yrs old) When I watch a movie I always want to see what the critics say about the film after u watch it. Pretty much every time I watch a film I read Roger Ebert’s review on it afterwards. I find that Ebert and I share similar tastes and even when I disagree with what he says, he always offers a fresh perspective that goes beyond a simple “is it good or bad.” Are there any literary critics like this who I should read?"
