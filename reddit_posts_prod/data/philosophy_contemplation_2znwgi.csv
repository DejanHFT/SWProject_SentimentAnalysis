Assessing Kierkegaard’s Critique of Arguments For the Existence of God,ConclusivePostscript,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/2znwgi/assessing_kierkegaards_critique_of_arguments_for/,107,150,"What follows is a critical assessment of Kierkegaard’s multipronged critique of arguments for God’s existence. After distilling his main objections and offering a reply to each, I hope it will be clear that his critique fails to persuade, but that we can still be sympathetic to—and learn from—some of what motivates it.

**Obj. #1.** The desire to prove God’s existence requires, in advance, assuming that the conclusion is already decided. But if God’s existence is already decided, proof is superfluous. (See *Philosophical Fragments*, p. 39; cf. pp. 42-44.)

**Reply to Obj. #1.** First, I may begin uncertain of the conclusion and wish to test whether a set of premises can, in fact, pass unsinged through the furnace of rational scrutiny. Perhaps I am a hopeful agnostic or an open-minded atheist. Second, I may have decided that I am personally certain *that* God exists, but wish to better understand *why* this is so. In so doing, I would be following the Anselmian principle of *fides quaerens intellectum* (faith seeking understanding). If God exists, then surely “he that made us with such large discourse” would not give us such intellectual capacity to “fust in us unused” (*Hamlet* IV.4). Third, I may not wish to give an argument to support or clarify *my own* faith, but in order to help the faith of another. It would not need to be my exclusive or even primary means of doing so, but it could form part of my overall apologetic.

**Obj. #2.** If by *prove God’s existence* I simply mean *prove that the unknown, which I already presume to exist, is God*, then I am not technically *proving* God’s existence at all, but am simply elucidating the logical entailments of a concept I have already posited. Indeed, “whether I am moving in the world of sensate palpability or in the world of thought, I never reason in conclusion to existence, but I reason in conclusion from existence. For example, I do not demonstrate that a stone exists but that something which exists is a stone. The court of law does not demonstrate that a criminal exists but that the accused, who does indeed exist, is a criminal.” (See *Fragments*, pp. 39-40; cf. *Concluding Unscientific Postscript*, p. 334; see also [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/2mlb1m/kierkegaard_apophatic_theology_and_the_limits_of/) post.)

**Reply to Obj. #2.** First, if I begin with some phenomenon, and perceive a need to account for it; and if I then deduce that only the existence of a being with qualities *x*, *y*, and *z* can account for it; and if, finally, I see that the description of this being matches the traditional concept of God—well, in that case I shall not have started with the God-concept itself, or with any of its conceptual entailments. Rather, I shall have shown from the explanatory exigencies of the phenomenon in question that a certain kind of cause must exist, and only then is a connection made to a given God-concept. (Cf. the method of Thomas Aquinas in his *Summa Theologiae* I.2.3.)

Second, it seems plainly false that we only reason *from* existence, at least if this is construed to mean *from the existence of the very thing in question*. Take Climacus’ example of the alleged criminal. If there exists some person who now stands accused of a crime, the accusation should have been made on the basis of some evidence. But perhaps the evidence was badly interpreted and it turns out that there was no crime at all; e.g., perhaps the person accused of murder is let off when it is demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt that his alleged victim was a suicide. Or perhaps there are multiple suspects, and a careful analysis of the murder weapon leads us to conclude that only one of the suspects could possibly have been guilty. In such a case, it is not from the existence of the accused that we prove criminality. We begin from the existence of the evidence, and determine whether the evidence is adequate to show that the accused—or someone else, or no one at all—must be guilty.

**Obj. #3.** Let us assume, then, unlike the above cases, and unlike the case of proving Napoleon’s existence from his works (which would involve a contingent relation, since “someone else could have done the same works”), that “between the god and his works there is an absolute relation.” Let us grant that only God can account for such works. What, then, *are* these works for which only God could account? “The works from which I want to demonstrate his existence do not immediately and directly exist, not at all. Or are the wisdom in nature and the goodness or wisdom in Governance right in front of our noses? Do we not encounter the most terrible spiritual trials here, and is it ever possible to be finished with all these trials?” (See *Fragments*, pp. 41-2; cf. p. 44 on Socrates.) “I observe nature … and I do indeed see omnipotence and wisdom, but I also see much that troubles and disturbs. The *summa summarum* [sum total] of this is an objective uncertainty…” (*Postscript*, pp. 203-4).

**Reply to Obj. #3.** This objection seems twofold. First, Climacus claims that the phenomena from which we are supposed to begin do not exist “directly,” but only ideally. But that only means that we must add a further step to our argument: we must show that the immediate phenomena in question really do exhibit qualities requiring a unique causal explanation, so that they could *only* be caused by a being of perfect power, goodness, and wisdom. And in doing so we are not seeking “to *infuse* nature with the idea of fitness and purposiveness” (*Fragments*, p. 44, my emphasis), but to *draw out* nature’s inherently teleological character (or whatever other character is relevant to the argument). *If* we succeed at this—and here we are discussing only the structure of such an argument, not the truth of its premises—*then* the “absolute relation” follows, not merely conceptually but actually. (See Obj. #7 and Reply below.)

Second, Climacus seems to envision something like the problem of natural evil, though it is unclear what he has in mind. (Perhaps certain forms of physical suffering? Kierkegaard *did* have poor physical health, after all.) But if we have already included the above step in our argument, deducing God’s existence from the phenomena and the required absolute causal relation (for each of which proponents of natural theology tend to give arguments), then the existence of God will have been proven *deductively*. Yet perhaps Climacus would concede this point, and the problem is not that he has in mind, in this section, *abductive* or *inductive* teleological arguments. Perhaps his point is that even if we have what appears to be a deductively sound argument for God’s existence, we might *also* have what appears to be a deductively sound argument from natural evil—a kind of Kantian antimony, if you will. In that case, we will need to not merely defend the former but rebut the latter. And why should this trouble us? We find out in the next objection.

**Obj. #4.** The process of giving an argument and subjecting it to rational criticism requires that I “be obliged continually to live *in suspenso* lest something so terrible happen that my fragment of demonstration would be ruined” (*Fragments*, p. 42).

**Reply to Obj. #4.** This objection seems to be little more than stating that reason can err. We may come to find that we made a bad deduction. Granted! But until an objection is successfully leveled against our argument, we are not obliged to conclude from *the possibility* that we have erred to our having erred *in actuality*. Yes, we should retain an appropriate amount of intellectual humility and restraint; no, this does not entail skepticism. Moreover, if my faith is not based primarily or exclusively on philosophical demonstrations, I need not fear the ruination of my “fragment.” (For more on faith, see Reply to Obj. #8 below.)

**Obj. #5.** “And how does the existence of the god emerge from the demonstration? Does it happen straightaway? … so long as I am holding on to the demonstration (that is, continue to be one who is demonstrating), the existence does not emerge, if for no other reason than that I am in the process of demonstrating it, but when I let go of the demonstration, the existence is there. Yet this letting go, even that is surely something; it is, after all, *meine Zuthat* [my contribution]. Does it not have to be taken into account, this diminutive moment, however brief it is—it does not have to be long, because it is a *leap*” (*Fragments*, p. 43).

**Reply to Obj. #5.** Properly speaking, the “existence of the god” does not *itself* emerge, but only *knowledge* of the god. But if the relation between my argument’s premises and conclusion is valid, then the conclusion emerges *not* as “my contribution” but simply follows from the premises. My *thinking about* the conclusion *as* conclusion is, of course, my contribution, but the conclusiveness itself is not. And while we cannot keep contemplating an argument’s soundness forever, once we have understood the argument it’s not clear why “letting go” of it would preclude its rational force remaining with us—that is, unless we are like those forgetful ones whom the apostle James describes (Jas. 1:23-24).

**Obj. #6.** “Therefore, anyone who wants to demonstrate the existence of God … proves something else instead, at times something that perhaps did not even need demonstrating, and in any case never anything better. For the fool says in his heart that there is no God, but he who says in his heart or to others: Just wait a little and I shall demonstrate it—ah, what a rare wise man he is! [fn.: What a superb theme for a crazy comedy!]” (*Fragments*, p. 43).

**Reply to Obj. #6.** Here the objection is not against the theistic proofs themselves, but against the motives of one intending to give such a proof. We should concede the possibility of a person having ignorant, proud, or foolish motives, but we should also affirm that this is not always what motivates the one interested of such a proof (see Reply to Obj. #1). Indeed, it is quite possible to see such proofs as clarifying what Paul says in Romans 1:20, where it is written that God’s “eternal power and divine nature, invisible though they are, have been understood and seen through the things he has made.” In doing so, we need not ignore his warning that “Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up” (1 Cor. 8:1).

**Obj. #7.** Although “God is not a name but a concept,” and the God-concept is one whose “*essentia involvit existentiam*” (essence involves existence), this *necessary* existence is not “factual,” but “ideal”; i.e., it is itself but another essence-determinant. (See *Fragments*, pp. 41-42, esp. fn.)

**Reply to Obj. #7.** This objection may very well apply to the ontological argument of Anselm, and of Descartes and several of the moderns. But unless Climacus wishes to defend the controversial Kantian claim that the cosmological argument reduces to the ontological, it is not clear why we should regard this objection as having very wide a scope. Against this Kantian claim, see, e.g., Hugh McCann, *Creation and the Sovereignty of God*, pp. 8, 20-21; see also my [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/2z9m6l/individuals_as_unconceptualizable_kierkegaards/).

**Obj. #8.** If we knew that God exists, we would no longer need faith. If a person has “certainty and definiteness, he cannot possibly venture everything, because then he ventures nothing even if he gives up everything” (See *Postscript*, p. 424).

**Reply to Obj. #8.** First, because of our disordered passions, and because we are often subject to *akrasia*, we do not always act on what we know—even what we know with certainty. A person with certainty must *still* find the courage and steadfastness to adhere to this certainty in the face of such existential obstacles. Second, some have distinguished between the *preambles* of faith, such as God’s existence, omnipotence, omnipresence, etc., and the *articles* of faith, such as the doctrines of the Trinity and the Incarnation. They maintain that we can rationally demonstrate the former, but not the latter. Therefore, even assuming the objection’s conception of the relationship between faith and knowledge, there would still be room for faith if God’s existence and metaphysical nature were proven. Third, according to the Christian tradition there are two forms of faith: faith that arises from *agape* or *caritas*, and faith that does not. So even if we had a rational faith, that by itself does not entail we would have the kind of faith that Scripture praises. (On this, see Jas. 2:19; cf. Aquinas, *ST* II-II.5.2.)

**Obj. #9.** “To demonstrate the existence of someone who exists is the most shameless assault, since it is an attempt to make him ludicrous, but the trouble is that one does not even suspect this, that in dead seriousness one regards it as a godly undertaking. How could it occur to anyone to demonstrate that he exists unless one has allowed oneself to ignore him; and now one does it in an even more lunatic way by demonstrating his existence right in front of his nose”; “But if this can happen, or if it is the case in an age, how does it happen except by simply leaving out the guilt-consciousness [before God]” (*Postscript*, pp. 545, 546).

**Reply to Obj. #9.** This objection, like Obj. #6, is not against the proofs, but against the character of the one giving them. It makes a couple of rather careless assumptions. First, it assumes that if a person is ignorant of God, it is necessarily the result of a person’s moral guilt and self-deception. By my lights, a more cautious religious epistemology will tread more carefully here and acknowledge various forms of non-culpable ignorance. Second, this objection assumes that one who attempts to give such a proof thereby fails to acknowledge that such a proof is neither necessary nor sufficient for faith—on this, see Replies to Objs. #1 and #6; cf. Aquinas, *ST* II-II.2.10.

**Conclusion.** In the above critique of arguments for God’s existence, we find objections to these arguments that deal with their assumptions (#1), structure (#2), and concept of existence (#3 and #7); with the fallibility and fragility of rational arguments in general (#4 and #5); with the motives of the person attempting such a proof (#6 and #9); and with the way such proofs render faith superfluous (#8). Although these objections are not persuasive for the reasons given above, we should concede that the last two kinds of objection can serve another purpose. For they confront the one interested in such arguments to check his or her motives, and to examine the nature and sources of his or her religious conviction. Indeed, I submit that Kierkegaard could have had his cake and eaten it too, allowing more room for the demonstrative without sacrificing his emphasis on faith and the existential."
