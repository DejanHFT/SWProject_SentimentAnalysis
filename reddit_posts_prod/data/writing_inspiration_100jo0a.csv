How inspired you to become a writer? What inspires you as a writer now?,ShortLeggedJeans,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/100jo0a/how_inspired_you_to_become_a_writer_what_inspires/,11,6,"For me it is always interesting what got people into writing and what inspires them further. I became a writer because creativity was always a thing by me. When I was little I read many books, it was my most favourite thing to do since I was 5 and I always liked to fantasize and tell stories to others. So it was natural for me to start writing. First childish poetry, then childish short stories, then bigger ones. As I grew up my storytelling grew with me. 

What inspires me now, is mostly people. I have what I call my muse. A girl, who’s creative and beautiful and talking to her always inspires me and I mostly have her in my head when I’m writing. Good films or good novels always inspire me as well. Also I love reading biographies and interviews. It can give me a lot of ideas too. 

And what about you?"
