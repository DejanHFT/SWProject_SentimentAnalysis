Thank you for recommending 'Flowers for Algernon',personahide,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/b6csfz/thank_you_for_recommending_flowers_for_algernon/,299,5060,"I finished listening to the book today and what an amazing journey has it been. 

I didn't expect that it would get this emotional towards the end. 

And the ending just blew me away. I'm a tad bit ashamed to admit it, but >!the scene with the deaf/mute kids in particular caught me off guard. From there on, it kept getting heavier and heavier. Charlie's last entries just brought me to tears.!<

I've been putting off reading the book for a while now. Saw someone recommending it a few weeks back and then just picked it up. Thank you my good people. "
