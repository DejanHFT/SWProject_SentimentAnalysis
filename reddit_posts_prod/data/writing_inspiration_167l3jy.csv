How much research should I do before taking inspiration from mythology?,GreyFartBR,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/167l3jy/how_much_research_should_i_do_before_taking/,3,2,"I am currently writing an urban fantasy novel with a magic system based on Egyptian mythology. Even though it's an ancient religion, I don't want to mess it up and misrepresent the culture, yet I also want to actually write the story soon. Even though I'll only use the concept of the soul being divided into parts, it seems there are so, so many things I'll have to look at if I want to include it. Most of it are just funerary rites that I won't use.

Maybe I'm looking at it in the wrong way, or I don't have to research all of it. I don't want to make excuses for not doing the work, so I want outside opinion.

Thank you for the attention."
