I just have to tell someone.. Today I quit my job! Getting ready for a 1 year adventure.,Njorun,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/w9lyw/i_just_have_to_tell_someone_today_i_quit_my_job/,220,416,"Since my boss asked me to not start telling people just yet, I came here to vent :)

So I had the talk with my boss today and told him why I'd like to quit. He was surprisingly understanding and very supportive. Now begins the long 3 month notice! I imagine going to work will feel very different knowing each day brings me closer to one of my greatest adventures. 

In October my boyfriend and I will head east and we're not planning to be back until a year later. There is an overall plan, but we try not to get into too much detail. What we do know is that we'll start off with the Trans Siberian Railway, and then through eastern Asia, Australia, NZ over to South America and then all the way up north through USA and Canada.

Wow... just writing about it makes my stomach flutter. Anyone out there who has done something similar? I think it might be a bit ambitious, but we're very open to changing things up along the way. My main concerns are about how to keep the relationship healthy (we're both kind if independent) packing, border crossings and money. We've set aside $25K each and are planning on mixing hostels with Bnb, couchsurfing, AirBnb and Wwoofing. 

**TL;DR: in 3 months [this](http://imgur.com/HDTQz) turns into reality!** 

EDIT: Oh my you people are amazing! Posted this thread and didn't get much more than downvotes so I logged out and went to bed. Woke up to this! THIS is the reason I want to travel, I wish I could meet up with all of you and share the experiences over a cup of coffee. Thank you, so much."
