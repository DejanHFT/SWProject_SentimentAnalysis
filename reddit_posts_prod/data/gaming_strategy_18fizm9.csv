Help me revisit my 'good old days' of fantasy strategy gaming,GamerMemeologist,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/18fizm9/help_me_revisit_my_good_old_days_of_fantasy/,7,0," I remember a time when I was really into fantasy strategy games. This period was marked in particular by Hearthstone during the days of Ben Brode, Clash of Clans before the builder's base was introduced, and Clash Royale while it still had only 9 arenas. These games are now... well, different. I miss the old rustic homey vibes they gave me. Maybe I am mistaken, maybe these games still have their charm. But I feel like I need a second opinion, some advice? Where can I find the same type of magic these games brought? Thank you for your advice :) "
