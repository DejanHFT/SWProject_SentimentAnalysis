What is an historical event that is a lot more significant than it's coverage in typical curriculum would suggest?,readwiteandblu,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/guh2ng/what_is_an_historical_event_that_is_a_lot_more/,1052,3947,"About 25 years ago, I read ""Freedom at Midnight"" about the history behind, and events surrounding, India's Independence Day, August 15, 1947.  I feel the creation of Pakistan as a Muslim homeland as part of India's break from Britain, has had ripple effects just as far reaching as subjects that were covered in far greater detail, at least in my education in the United States. What are some other such blind spots in the typical curriculum?"
