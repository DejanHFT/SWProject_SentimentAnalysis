Suggestions On Where To Stay and Adventure In Puerto Rico In Mid December,xxcmtnman,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/181gmki/suggestions_on_where_to_stay_and_adventure_in/,2,1,"Hello all! My family is going to spend 10 days in Puerto Rico in mid December. We're planning on staying at the beach, but haven't nailed down which town or city to stay in. We're definitely up for staying in a couple of different towns while we're there. We're definitely not planning on sitting on the beach all day every day, and will probably want to get out and Adventure and sight see most days. I'm planning on hikes, exploring, I'm going to charter a fly fishing trip at least one day. 

So, any suggestions on where to go would be much appreciated!"
