Feedback on my plan to mesh-screen my balcony?,clownyfish,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/p4629e/feedback_on_my_plan_to_meshscreen_my_balcony/,61,338,"I'm a renter.
My balcony has these [shades](https://i.imgur.com/93ScCsK.jpeg) built in. I think they're some kind of painted aluminium.  Unfortunately, the angled slats do little to curb the pretty extreme wind that comes through regularly.  My plants are getting blasted and knocked over all the time. 

My planned solution is to put up [screening mesh](https://www.bunnings.com.au/pillar-1-83-x-5m-30-uv-cover-hail-and-shade-mesh_p0135230) to take most of the force out of the wind.

My renter-friendly plan is to use [steel wire rope](https://www.bunnings.com.au/pinnacle-2mm-x-30m-316-marine-grade-stainless-steel-wire-rope_p4310789), [butterfly clips](https://www.bunnings.com.au/coolaroo-32-x-80mm-black-shadecloth-accessory-butterfly-clips-20-pack_p3301479), and [corner clips](https://www.bunnings.com.au/icon-plastics-42mm-shade-clips-12-pack_p3300161), to wrap the mesh around the shades to achieve something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/mHryL4O.jpg). I'd use [wire grips](https://www.bunnings.com.au/taskmaster-3mm-316-stainless-steel-wire-rope-grips-4-pack_p0237911) to form loops at the wire ends.



One thing I'll have to watch out for (and test) is cutting the mesh the perfect length to hold tension - unless anyone can think of a better way to tension the steel wire, or a different approach entirely?


Would love any feedback, I've never done anything like this before."
