Favourite Modern Literary Fiction Book?,TobianFermog,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7rt5iw/favourite_modern_literary_fiction_book/,56,33,"We discuss a lot of favourites from genres on here, but there isn't enough discussion of literary fiction as a genre (which it is, at the end of the day). 

My favourite modern literary fiction book would have to be Beloved by Toni Morrison. So powerful, so intelligent, so perfectly excecuted. I'm still unwrapping layers to its themes 2 years after I first read it. 

What's y'all favourite literary fiction book? And what is it about the book that makes it, in your mind, literary fiction? "
