Creating a Learning Schedule,Zenith-of-Entropy,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/15d283j/creating_a_learning_schedule/,2,9,"Hello all!  


I'm not sure if this is the right sub to post in but I couldn't think of where to go aside from here and r/AskReddit.

Long story short, I want to set a schedule where I set aside time to learn about multiple subjects but am curious as to what would be the most effective way.   


Lets say I have three subjects I want to learn and three open days to do so. Would it be better to dedicate one day per subject or to learn all three subjects each day but for shorter windows of time?"
