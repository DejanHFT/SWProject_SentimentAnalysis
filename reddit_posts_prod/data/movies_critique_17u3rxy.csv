Apart from Scarface (1983) What are some movies that you feel a lot of the viewers miss the point of?,StreetsOfYancy,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/17u3rxy/apart_from_scarface_1983_what_are_some_movies/,159,0,"I wanted to exclude Scarface because the discourse on how he is idolized has been done to death (mainly in the mid 2000s hip hop culture). What are some other movies you like but you feel that too many people misunderstand when enjoying it?

One such movie is American History X. I think a lot of people love the movie for its subject matter and performances, but I've met far too many fans of the film who think it's about how you can only 'cure' racism with love and compassion, and how good, normal people get pushed into bad situations due to tragedy. This seems to gloss over all of the elements of unconscious discrimination fed into the main character at a young age by his father. Also the introspection and growing critique of the ideology of his gang, and the themes of grooming and exploitation by predatory ideologues. 

I could go on but you get the point.

What are some other films that fit this mold?"
