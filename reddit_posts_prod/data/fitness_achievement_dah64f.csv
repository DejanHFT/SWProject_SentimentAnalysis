How do you achieve a routine with an irregular Work Schedule,Spicerwild,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/dah64f/how_do_you_achieve_a_routine_with_an_irregular/,10,5,"Hello, first time posting, F24, average fitness. I am wondering about your personal experiences with balancing work and fitness. I thrive on structure, having a set schedule for a week makes going to the gym and staying motivated second nature, but since leaving college that has been nearly impossible. My job as a stage hand is never the same, every single day/week/month is different and I love it for the fluidity but my nice structured work out gets thrown out the window as soon as a call time changes .

How do you deal with this? Is it literally push-through-it? Is too much specificity a killer or a necessity? I may have too many options to try and finding one doesnt work as well as what I was hoping without sticking with it is definitely crippling my progress. Thank you for your time."
