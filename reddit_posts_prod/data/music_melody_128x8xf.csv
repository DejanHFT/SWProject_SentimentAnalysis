The melody for “One Of These Days” by Bedouine,nedoeva,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/128x8xf/the_melody_for_one_of_these_days_by_bedouine/,6,5,"This song’s melody sounds exactly like another folk song from the 70’s I think, and I can’t put my finger on it. Male voice. It’s driving me insane and I can’t figure it out. 

This is a shot in the dark, can anyone help me on this? 

Or is this a case of Mandela effect?"
