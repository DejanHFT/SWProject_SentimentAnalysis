"My partner (26M) and I (32F) are always arguing about our finances. What can I do to be more understanding and supportive, yet not overlook my personal goals and self-respect?",InternationalCut749,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18us5hq/my_partner_26m_and_i_32f_are_always_arguing_about/,53,13,"My partner and I have been together for 2 years now, and we never fight about anything else except for money. I know that Reddit can be very harsh, but am willing to take the necessary steps.


Background: we both came from broken homes and are highly codependent and suffer from abandonment issues. I had a privileged childhood because of my high-earning father, but grew up anxious about money after watching my mother struggle financially post-divorce. He grew up in a lower-income broken household with a lack of financial literacy, and does not earn/save much. 


We’re engaged at the moment, and have goals like homeownership and having kids. I’ve worked hard to scrimp and save 200k for a home purchase, and unfortunately he’s only got 5k tucked away. Tbh, I’m fine with this because I understand he’s younger than me, had a different environment growing up, and supports me emotionally. But I am a little sad because he tells me he is serious about our goals, but doesn’t save a penny because he spends 2-3k a month on food deliveries, gaming, and vapes. 


For the past 2 years I’ve held back on comfort things and travelling - in part due to me wanting to save, but to be honest it’s mostly because if I wanted to go on a trip or do anything, he wouldn’t be able to recover from it financially if we went 50/50. I’m not a fan of budget travelling as it’s the one time I take a break from my highly stressful job, but grin and bare through it.


Eventually we want to have kids, but in this economy, I worry we won’t be able to afford diapers if I’m not working! So I’ve lost hope on having children tbh, and it’s all I ever really wanted.


The thing that drives me nuts: he gets annoyed when I ask if he could pay me back for his share for things. We have an upcoming trip planned for him to meet my family, and we agreed he’d pay for his ticket, and I’d pay for everything else. As I earn more, I’m covering 70%. it’s been 2-3 weeks now, and he still hadn’t paid me, or even given me a date on when to expect it (he knows I’m highly anxious about $). Earlier he said that he was gonna order some food delivery again (he does it daily), and I got so pissed off because he’s spent hundreds on food but can’t bother to pay me back 1k? I asked if he could pay me back before ordering food, and he immediately shut down and ignored me. After 20 mins of silence I asked him why he was mad and he said he was annoyed with me, and left it at that.


What am I doing wrong? How can I change? Is this what marriage is going to be like?

TLDR: We have different financial backgrounds and goals, but love each other deeply. I’m concerned about our future together - is it salvageable?"
