How can i get my creativity i had as a child back?,x_pineapple_pizza_x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/cyg2gq/how_can_i_get_my_creativity_i_had_as_a_child_back/,7,3,"When i was smaller i used to grab a piece of paper and just draw what ever the hell was on my mind, which ended up in crazy and often interesting drawings. Low quality? I guess, i was like 8, but creative. I was sketching all day, no exceptions. School? Drawing. Car ride? Drawing. Restaurant? Drawing. Come home? Drawing. Should've gone to sleep an hour ago? Drawing. I had a pencil in my hand constantly and i always found something to draw. This went on until around age 13-14 where i started struggling in school, and had to shift my concentration there. I took a 'break' from art essentially. Of course i still doodled during classes, but it got less and less to the point i stopped drawing completely for about a year or two. Now im 16 and i picked back up on it. I started learning the theory part (shading, proportions etc). The thing is that every time i look at a blank piece of paper my mind goes blank as well. I can spend a good half hour thinking of something to sketch but i cant come up with anything new. Imagine very severe creative block but its lasted for about a year or more now. Has something like this happened to anyone else? And is there anything i can do about it or is it possible to just lose your creativity?"
