Last minute 2 week adventure - SA or Thailand or somewhere else?,SymbolUnderTheCaret,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/yw7yo5/last_minute_2_week_adventure_sa_or_thailand_or/,3,1,"Sorry for the vague title. I'm based in the UK, have had a horrendous 2022, and due to a few other life complexities I have 2 weeks to spend before the end of the year. I've travelled a lot in the past but not since before the pandemic, so am a little nervous and overwhelmed by the options. Solo female. I love spectacular scenery, hiking (lots of experience with multi-day hikes, though usually teahouse or hostel-focused - not carried a tent), culture, interesting food, spirituality. Not so much a lie-for-days-on-the-beach person or a museum junkie. Looking to have some wonder in life restored.

\- I went to South East Asia back in 2015, and had particular fun in Thailand, though only went north instead of south. I loved the ease of travel there, and feel that I would have to plan less if I went there. I remember a beautiful blend of temples, fruit smoothies, friendly faces and delicious food. The south could be such a break from the grim UK, and I could go snorkelling and swimming. On the other hand I might find the south too party for me, what do you think? I'm 33, am I going to feel too old?? Have also been to Vietnam and passed through Cambodia (just saw Angkor Wat).

\- On the other hand, in late 2018 I went to Patagonia and count it among one of the best trips of my life. I did the W trek in Torres del Paine in Chile, and also spent a week in El Chalten, hiking every day, painting on mountaintops and loving life. Is there anywhere like El Chalten someone could recommend? More Chile? Elsewhere in South America? I did, however, have several months to plan to that trip. I've no idea what's possible at such late notice. I only know fragments of Spanish.

\-Very open to ideas for other destinations that fit the bill

Yes, I know flights will cost a bomb..."
