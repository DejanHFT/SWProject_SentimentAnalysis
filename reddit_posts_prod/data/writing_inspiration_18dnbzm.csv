Need music/movie inspiration,Accomplished-Try7894,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18dnbzm/need_musicmovie_inspiration/,5,1,"I'm writing a short story about a boy who is the sole witness to three spacecrafts crash land on Earth, each with an alien from different planets. The entire plot is that it is up to that boy to find a way to help those three aliens get back home while also hiding them from this big evil alien guy who's trying to take over the entire universe. And also keeping their alien identities a secret from everyone else. 

I've sort of reached a writers block and I was wondering if anyone knew any songs/movies that are loosely related to what I'm writing so I could get some inspiration. Like for example, I've been listening to In The Woods Somewhere by Hozier and I really enjoyed the movie Earth to Echo!"
