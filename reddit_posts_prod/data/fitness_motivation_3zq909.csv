Running motivators for those who hate running?,rs_yes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3zq909/running_motivators_for_those_who_hate_running/,49,0,"I'm one of those guys who truly hates running.  I find it boring and tedious, but I realize it's necessary.  I'm curious to know, for folks like myself, what are your motivators to push you to run?  And, how long do you normally run each week?"
