Transition from Brick Render to Drywall,Rappix74,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/187u2gm/transition_from_brick_render_to_drywall/,4,1,"I have a bit of a dilemma and am hoping to be able to get some input from you guys on the best way to achieve a clean finish

My house has all brick rendered walls and I've recently decided to remove the builtin wardrobes and replace them. My new wardrobes don't reach all the way to the ceiling (about a 20cm gap) therefor I was planning on framing the top part and putting drywall on it.

I have 2 issues with this solution
Firstly the drywall finish will be much smoother than the brick render so I'm looking for ways to emulate the render finish on the drywall
Second I don't know how I would be able to transition from drywall to render. I'm thinking of just using some crack filler but not sure about longevity of it"
