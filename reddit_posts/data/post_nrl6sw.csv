Required time/effort to sequence a virus: now vs then?,Komahal,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/nrl6sw/required_timeeffort_to_sequence_a_virus_now_vs/,5,22,"In 2003 we saw SARS - a virus 80% identical to the Sars-cov2 that causes COVID-19.
In the 16 years between, the average phone today is more powerful than the average desktop PC then... Just the desktop processing capabilities increased by something like 1000%. 
There have been enormous advances in machine learning, AI, genetics and so on. 

Let's say that a guy named Dave worked in a lab in 2003 and in 2019, and he was tasked with gene sequencing both the SARS and Sars-cov2 viruses. 
How much time would he have needed in 2003 vs 2019?
Hours vs days? Days vs weeks?"
