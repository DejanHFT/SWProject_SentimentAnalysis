[HOW TO] Make potatoes in your soups / stews taste delicious -- simple trick,thesqlguy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/17fpvp/how_to_make_potatoes_in_your_soups_stews_taste/,143,689,"I am still amazed by the number of people who don't know this little tip, so I thought maybe I'd post it here.

When adding diced potatoes to a soup or stew, do the following:

1) Don't bother washing or peeling the potatoes

2) Dice the potatoes up and put into a large bowl -- not your pot!

3) Fill the bowl with cold water, enough to cover the potatoes.   Notice how grainy and starchy and cloudy the water is.  That would normally be your soup, we don't want that!

4) Let soak for only a few minutes, then empty the water and rinse the potatoes.  

5) Fill up and rinse your potatoes one more time.  

6) Drain all water as best you can.

7) NOW add the potatoes to the soup

8) Cook the soup for an additional 25-35 minutes and the potatoes should be done.


The result is that your soup isn't starchy or cloudy or grainy, and the potatoes are soft, creamy and melt in your mouth.

Don't add the potatoes in too soon -- if you're really cooking your soup a long time to let the flavors come together, or to get flavors from meat or bones, only add potatoes at the very end when there's 25-35 minutes left of high-temp cooking.  We don't want them to turn to mush!

That's it! Common knowledge?"
