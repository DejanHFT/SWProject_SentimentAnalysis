"How do we measure the earth's aggregate surface temperature, and how do we eliminate statistic noise from this measurement?",giraffevomitfacts,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/15583ap/how_do_we_measure_the_earths_aggregate_surface/,4,18,"I read today that the earth's surface temperature is the highest this July than it has been in 125,000 years. What data are we using, and from where? Is it an aggregate of all measurements taken by particular kinds of meteorological bodies,i.e. national weather services, in each country on earth? Also, how do we get continually accurate and comparable measurements in areas that might be hotter over time due to, for example, increased use of paving and expansion of surrounding urban areas?"
