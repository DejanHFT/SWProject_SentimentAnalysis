Garage cooling exhaust fan,Alden2057,https://i.redd.it/hj41sgovyjgb1.jpg,3,1,"I've been thinking of how to easily ventilate my garage space. It can get particularly hot when I work in here. These two ducts are intended for the gas water heater, but I am wondering about installing an exhaust fan into one of them, I am thinking the upper one since heat rises and I want to cool the space, then I could achieve something similar to a whole house fan. What do you think?"
