What are commonly believed historical inaccuracies?,BikeLaneHero,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/fsss3t/what_are_commonly_believed_historical_inaccuracies/,50,25,"As some folks might know, the iconic Keep Calm and Carry On sign wasn't actually distributed much during WWII and it only became well known in the aughts when it started being sold by a bookstore in the UK. I kind of imagine that in 50 or 100 years, we'll have movies about London during WWII and they'll have that Keep Calm sign up even though you wouldn't have seen it during the war.

And that got me to thinking......what are super common historical inaccuracies that are collectively believed? What are ways we envision the past that are just completely inaccurate and wrong?"
