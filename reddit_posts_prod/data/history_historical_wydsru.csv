Popular historical non-fiction like Erik Larson and Ben McIntyre,Thraxmonger,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/wydsru/popular_historical_nonfiction_like_erik_larson/,22,28,"Typically, my non-fiction reading is confined to true crime. But I've always had a soft spot for personal/anecdotal popular history, and none have impressed me as much as books like Erik Larson's The Devil in the White City and In the Garden of Beasts, and Ben McIntyre's Agent Zigzag and Double Cross. 

Both of these authors have a taste for the quirky and peculiar details -- I really enjoy this approach. Both maintain a sense of humour throughout, which can be hard when you're writing about Nazis and serial killers. But they pull it off. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for popular historical non-fiction in the vein of Larson and McIntyre?"
