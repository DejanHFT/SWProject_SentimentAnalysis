Reddit...please help keep me OUT OF JAIL. Need help finding tracking info from email headers..please,helpkeepmeoutofjail,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/axrx8/redditplease_help_keep_me_out_of_jail_need_help/,576,1456,"Long story short, I am being accused of forgery, and what the prosecutor is alleging is that I forged a series of emails and correspondence from a company to myself. TRUTH is I have over 30 email exchanges from a representative of this company, and now the company is stating to the prosecutor that they have no email records on their end to back up my claim. 

I have every single email from the individual at the company and now I am trying to see if its possible to trace the emails through the email header info back to the company's computer to clearly show that they indeed were sent from the company to me. 

Reddit, I have been a long time member here (this is a throwaway account), and I am in desperate need of some help on this one. If anyone can assist I would gladly contact you privately and give you the header info or the full email to assist in getting the tracking info if possible, rather than publicly sharing this to the whole reddit world. Even tips on tracking it myself would be appreciated,anything. Thank you very much!



*edit: If you can assist just let me know, and  I will gladly PM the full header, just do not want to share it publicly here, as it could lead to harassment of the company as that certainly could make matters worse for me. I appreciate any help or info given. 


**edit: In response to the evidence question, I submitted copies of the email correspondence to the prosecutor in response to a request for additional info on an issue, therefore by them checking with the company, and the company stating that they have no records matching up to my email or corroborate what I submitted, they are now accusing me of forgery as the prosecutor believes I made them up. 

***edit: First off thank you to everyone who has chimed in on some useful info, this assistance is more than I expected. Secondly the email is all saved on third party server (yahoo) and going on some advice received I am going to try and get a Forensic computer specialist involved to see if they can provide some signed support to back me up and submit this to the prosecutor. 



****edit: To answer many questions, I do have a lawyer retained, who has been working on this issue with me, he was just as boggled as I was when the prosecution advised that the company (who states they keep all emails from the past 2 years) said they have no record of me having any contact with them (my contact with them was from just over a year ago), especially since there is specific information sent from the company to me, that there would be no way of me finding out on my own. My lawyer clearly is not a specialist when it comes to computer evidence issues and email headers, etc, so I am trying to assist in my own defense as much as possible. 


****edit (final one for this evening 2/3/10)I have forwarded on a lot of new information to my lawyer this evening, hopefully it will lead to something meaningful and will have something new to update this with tomorrow. Obviously as some of you have astutely surmised there are more details to this situation than I have typed above. #1 I do not have time to type the long drawn out saga out. #2 as this is still a pending issue I do not fill it would be in my best interest to divulge all the details.  ----- I will however continue to update this post on the current goings and when this issue is resolved (most likely within the next week) I will then give the complete details and outcome whether it was good or bad.  Once again thank you to all that have offered advice. It is very very much appreciated.



*****edit (2/4/10) Good morning all, I am in shock with the mostly positive response I have received. It is way more than I ever anticipated. (on the front page,wow). Anyways here is this mornings update. Forwarded a lot of relevant information to my attorney and am awaiting their response on moving forward. In the mean time I contacted a Forensic computer expert in my area, who I think I am going to work with. He advised that he should be able independently verify and produce a document/affidavit showing that the emails did originate from the company. I feel confident in his ability to help me. (for 200/hr though..wow proving one's self not guilty is pricey)This would be prior to getting a subpoena served on yahoo or the company. Hopefully this will be enough to have the prosecutor back down. Once again thank you to everyone!"
