side hustle help,rosoeboi,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/ume8x8/side_hustle_help/,1,5,"So, like alot of people i feel like I've spent my life working my ass off for other people and havnt got much to show for it.

I've got my main 9-5, and I used to do a bit of buying and selling. 

Buying and selling I really enjoyed and made profit from (on a very small level) I've got an ebay shop with 100% positive feedback with 250 sales. This is something I would love to do full time, im not looking to get mega rich, just live comfortably without worrying about bills.

My main motivation though is my daughter, I want to give her security, im working shifts, and I have her at mine everyday (I don't live with her mum) but the times I have her change every week so she doesn't know if she's coming or going, I have to rely on her mums parents for childcare while I work (I have no family) 

Ideally I would want the flexibility of being able to work the hours I want, take parenting heat of everyone else and know I get out what I put in.

So with all of that said could anyone give advice?
I've watched loads of random YouTube videos in the past about making money from home but you never know how much of your time and money to sink into certain ideas as you don't know if these videos are created just to serve the uploader.

I'm willing to put in the extra overtime at work, sell stuff that's needed etc to raise extra capital.

So the question I'm probably asking is, what's a good place to start in? Either slowly building up capital that you can keep flipping, or investing a few grand into something that gives you interest that you can reinvest etc? Or any sort of proven side hustle ideas you can build from scratch with or without start up money?

Many thanks yous!"
