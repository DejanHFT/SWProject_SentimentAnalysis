What film cliches do you wish people would stop criticizing?,Cmyers1980,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/qwx7ej/what_film_cliches_do_you_wish_people_would_stop/,1188,1287,"What film cliches do you wish people would stop criticizing for one reason or another?

My example is when people point out that one thing or another about the film is implausible or too coincidental. Obviously there are cases where this is a valid critique but besides that some people forget that films often need implausible events or decisions for the story to unfold. It’s fiction. It’s coincidental that Butch would run into Marsellus Wallace in the middle of the street after betraying him in Pulp Fiction but it’s a great scene nonetheless. People don’t watch fictional films to see nothing but mundane events play out in day to day life with nothing out of the ordinary or fantastical in any way happening."
