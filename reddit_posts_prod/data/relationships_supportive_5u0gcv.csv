"Me 31F with my 53F mom, her life is falling apart (due to her bad choices) and expects her children to pick up all the pieces; how do I remain supportive but not get screwed over?",momdeservesdivorce,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5u0gcv/me_31f_with_my_53f_mom_her_life_is_falling_apart/,71,383,"So first off - using a throwaway.

Ok, I am going to give you a quick background of my mom (we will call her Kim). She is 53; has 6 children with 3 different fathers. She has probably worked maybe 5 years out of her entire life; she babysat children when we were growing up, and then she was just a stay at home mom. She was married to my first step dad for 10 years, they divorced when i was about 13. She then worked as a cook at a restaurant. She met my 2nd step dad when I was 15 and she got pregnant with my littlest brother after they were dating for about 2 months, so they moved in together. At that point my mom and I didn't get along at all - she is a narcissist and I am clearly the scapegoat child. So I moved out when I was 16, when she was 7 months pregnant. I didn't really have a good relationship with my littlest brother's father (my mom's newest boyfriend at the time) lets call him Dan.

So Dan was a great guy - he took in all of my mom's other children (ages from 12-6 at the time) as well as having one of his own on the way. He is about 10 years younger than my mom; and had just started his own business. He worked his butt off to support a family of 5, soon to be 6. My mom didn't work because she was pregnant and once she had my brother she continued to not work. Life was stressful for them in the beginning, but Dan's business kept growing and getting more successful.

To try and keep this short - fast forward to about a year or so ago. Kim and Dan have been married for about 10 years, things seem to be going well. Dan's business is doing GREAT! He's making boatloads of money, my mom is enjoying staying home, my little brother is spoiled rotten and all of us other children now have moved out and have started our own lives. 

My mom is just as crazy as ever though, she is constantly fighting with one of us kids over something stupid, she spends money like it's going out of style - constantly racking up credit card debt on stupid purchases (online bidding sites, cheap jewelry, gambling, etc) - Dan the angel that he seems to be, puts up with it - will pay off the credit cards, deal with my mom and things will be good for a while.

Well all of a sudden; something has been off about Dan - he's been 'seeing people' in his house; there are burglars trying to get him, etc. Well turns out he's on meth. My mom doesn't want to help him, nope - she files divorce papers. Us kids all tried to help Dan, but nothing seems to work. We tried having an intervention, tried begging him to go to treatment - ok ok, well we are pretty sure he's still on drugs. 

My mom, now moved into their old house (they used to rent it out, but it was just sitting vacant at the time). Their nice house is now sitting vacant, and Dan is living with his mother - trying to get his life straight. 

So now, my mom doesn't work - doesn't have ANY income and is getting divorced. The only money she gets is child support which is court ordered, but at this point, no alimony or anything like that until court is over. So she is poor (compared to how she was used to living, not having to worry about any money). So she is constantly asking us kids for favors, help around the house, etc. I don't mind helping at all, as horrible as she can be, I am not a monster. 

Now though, things are getting worse - Dan hasn't been paying child support, her car which is a company car is getting taken away this month, and she is asking us kids to buy her a car or help her with a loan for a car. I don't feel comfortable with this - she wouldn't have helped us if we were in the same scenario; she would say, you need to figure it out. 

I guess I am looking for any advice as to how to 'help her out' but yet not get taken advantage of. She will take advantage of us all if we allow it. At this point us kids are trying to just keep our distance, try and have a relationship with Dan yet, but yet not make our mom feel like a pile of shit.

tldr: my mom is getting divorced and is losing everything that she is used to, she has been trying to depend on us kids for support, but she will take advantage if we let her. How do we try and be there for her, but yet have boundaries so we don't get taken advantage of?"
