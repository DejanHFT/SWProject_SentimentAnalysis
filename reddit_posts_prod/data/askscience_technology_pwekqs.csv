Is ionizing radiation harmful to technology?,bandti45,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/pwekqs/is_ionizing_radiation_harmful_to_technology/,22,7,I know that ionizing radiation is harmful to living creatures because it damages our DNA and large amounts of other electromagnetic radiation can mess with certain technologies (very strong magnet wiping hhd data). I have no idea if ionizing radiation affects any types of technology though.
