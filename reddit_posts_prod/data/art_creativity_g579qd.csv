Multi-disciplinary creative title?,partiallypretentious,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/g579qd/multidisciplinary_creative_title/,0,1,"I'm not even sure if this is the right place to post this, but I've really been struggling with what to call myself. I'm a painter, an illustrator, graphic designer,  a writer, and a musician. And I can't just pick one direction. I love them all, and I've built them all up my entire life. 

I feel like saying ""artist"" only covers the first two. I've been saying ""multi-disciplinary creative"" which, sounds like I'm confused. Which, obviously I am. But I'm not supposed to show that lol. Help?"
