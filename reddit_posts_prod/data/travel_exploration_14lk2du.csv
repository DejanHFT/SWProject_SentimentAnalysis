Weekend in Buffalo. Recommendations or other close by cities to explore?,kenshinx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/14lk2du/weekend_in_buffalo_recommendations_or_other_close/,10,2,"I'm flying to Buffalo in August for a concert, so I'm also looking to make a fun weekend out of it. I'm a foodie and like any kind of cool sights. I've already been to Niagara Falls on the Canada side though. Are there certain recommendations on what to check out while there? 

I'm also open to driving a few hours to check out other cities during the weekend, so I don't necessarily even need to spend all the time in Buffalo. I even thought about flying into Toronto and then making the drive to Buffalo for the concert."
