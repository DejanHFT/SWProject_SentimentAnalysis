How to be strong and supportive of a partner quitting?,PinkyPurgatory,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/qvuy8p/how_to_be_strong_and_supportive_of_a_partner/,5,2,"(LDR) 

Hi I’m (F22) and my fiancé (M25) is in the process of quitting alcohol. 

He’s done so much in so little time and is still so hard on himself. Since about October after he had his surgery, he quit cigarettes and got back on antidepressants. As someone who is depressed I know this is normal, as I have it and do the same regularly, but I don’t know what to say without coming off preachy or annoying.

He worries about a lot of things having bad anxiety as well (depression and anxiety pair seem to be quite the inseparable duo, don’t they?). He worries about our relationship and how for most of it he struggled with drinking. He worries about feeling numb and questions it. 

I think the numbness and feeling off is a mix between the depression and all these chemical imbalances in his brain from all the changes he’s making. At least I really hope it’s just that.

When he said how he felt about the relationship, I got worried like I did earlier on because I worried about the same thing. I worried maybe he only liked me because he was drinking and I looked prettier that way. When he mentioned his sexuality as well recently (he’s been bi for as long as I’ve known him) I worried even more as I’ve had someone reject me in the past and later turn out to be more gay than bi.

I guess what I’m trying to say is, we’re both in bad places mentally and I just wanna be there for him and see him through this. I just can’t stop worrying about what he said and our future :,,,-)

TLDR: my fiancé is quitting alcohol, cigarettes, and starting back up in one go. I want to be supportive and strong for him, but some of the stuff he’s said has struck a cord with me and so I’m holding back a response to him and crying in the bathroom"
