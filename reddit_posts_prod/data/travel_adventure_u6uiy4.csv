Looking for another company organising epic adventures...,laglory,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/u6uiy4/looking_for_another_company_organising_epic/,28,6,"For the past few years I've been doing adventures with a company called The Adventursists. All their adventures come with a warning:

>*Your chances of being seriously injured or dying as a result of taking part are high. Individuals who have taken part in past Adventurists' adventures have been permanently disfigured, seriously disabled and even lost their life.*  
>  
>*This is not a glorified holiday, it's an unsupported adventure and so by its very nature extremely risky. You really are on your own and you really are putting both your health and life at risk. This is what makes them adventures.*

So far I have driven a TukTuk for 2500km in India, 1600km in Sri Lanka, rode a 100cc Monkey Bike through Peru, and flew a paramotor as part of their Icarus Trophy.

These aren't chilled out organised holidays where they book hotels for you and you're travelling in an organised group, doing some sightseeing. It's adventures where you if break down in the middle of nowhere, you're on your own. Adventures with significant element of danger and risk involved.

I am now looking for the next adventure, but I can't find anything along those lines. Any recommendations?
