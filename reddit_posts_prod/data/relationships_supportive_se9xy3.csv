My (24F) fiancé (24M) doesn’t seem supportive of me in my attempts to make new friends,bcgcas,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/se9xy3/my_24f_fiancé_24m_doesnt_seem_supportive_of_me_in/,4,1,"Okay background information and long post ahead - I moved to a new town about 8 months ago after a messy break-up in which I also lost basically all my friends. I met my fiancé in my new town and we got engaged, and then moved in together (I know it was fast - don’t need to be told lol). I work remotely from home and my fiancé works a blue collar job where all of his friends work as well (so he is with his friends all day every day while I am home alone). Working from home and the pandemic have prevented me from making friends and I have honestly been miserable and so lonely. My fiancé knows this and we have had so many conversations about it. I downloaded Bumble BFF in hopes that it would be an easy way to meet new people. On Saturday, I hung out with my new friend from Bumble “Laura” for the first time. It went really well and we made plans to hang out again this past Monday, which we did. 

Laura and I went to dinner and we decided that she would come to my house afterward and smoke with my fiancé and me (I asked him in advance and he said it was fine). She came to my house and got way too high and didn’t feel like she could drive 25 mins back to her house. At this point it was about 10:30 pm. Of course I wanted to accommodate her as much as possible so I offered for her to spend the night or to follow her home but she wanted to ask her husband to come follow her home instead. At this point my fiancé was agitated as he can be very “territorial” of our time together since he works a lot. He also kept talking about how he had to get up for work but we normally go to bed around 11:30. He didn’t want to wait for her husband to get to our house (we are texting about all of this by the way, not discussing it in front of her). I am very careful when it comes to smoking with others and making sure they are comfortable, so I told her it was fine for her husband to come follow her home if she felt like it was best. Also, I was trying to make a new friend, I wasn’t gonna kick her out of my house on our second time hanging out. At this point things are a little awkward and there’s tension in the air because my fiancé is clearly in a bad mood, and it’s embarrassing.  Her husband shows up 45ish minutes later and they stay until around midnight, so past our bedtime. I did feel bad about keeping my fiancé up that late and am wondering if I was an ass for that. I asked him to stay up with me and wait for them to leave and I should have just let him go to bed probably. They finally leave and my fiancé and I are both very upset for different reasons - my fiancé was upset for reasons stated above and I was just emotional because I felt a little defeated and discouraged and like I had ruined a potential friendship (it’s an emotional and difficult topic for me in my current phase of life. I’ve experienced a lot of anxiety and depression around it). Laura and I touched base the next day and both apologized - she felt like she overstayed her welcome and I felt like we created an uncomfortable atmosphere for her. 

So now Laura and I are good and she asked if I wanted to hang out this weekend and come to her house. I really want to because I like hanging out with her but when I mentioned it to my fiancé he told me that he didn’t want me to go if her husband was going to be there because he gave my fiancé “bad vibes” and he “doesn’t trust them”. Honestly my fiancé is a pretty good judge of character and he’s had crazy hunches about people that turned out to be true, so I try to respect his “vibes” lol. I can easily suggest that we go to dinner or something else this time, but deep friendships are very important to me and I want to be able to go to my friends’ houses and welcome them into mine. And I want to be able to get to know their husbands, obviously on an appropriate level. 

I feel like my fiancé is not being very supportive  of my attempts to make friends. He knows how lonely and sad I am and I just wish he would be happy for me/encourage me to get out more instead of having something negative to say whenever I am trying to make friends. Is this a red flag? I don’t want to keep dealing with this. What should I mention when I bring this up to him (if I should try to talk to him about it at all)?

TLDR; I have desperately been wanting new friends for months and finally hung out with a friend that I like, but my fiancé doesn’t want me to hang out with her at her house because he doesn’t like her husband. It also doesn’t seem like he wants me to make friends at all as he got very agitated with me when I had her over to our house."
