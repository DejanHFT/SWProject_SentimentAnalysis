Any chance there's anyone out there who could help save my wedding?,BigPapiC-Dog,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hg5im/any_chance_theres_anyone_out_there_who_could_help/,982,1187,"EDIT:  [Here is the update](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/i0kg0/update_im_the_guy_whose_wedding_venue_cancelled/)

So...getting married in Tampa in 3 weeks.  We had booked a big mansion for the wedding with the idea of having the ceremony and reception there.  That way, anyone who wanted to stay over could crash on the floor or whatever.

The property owner emailed me today talking about a ""lawsuit"" and ""code enforcement"".  Long story short (his email was only three lines), we lost the venue.  I don't know what I am going to do about him, but for now, I am trying to find somewhere to have the ceremony.  Problem is that June is a fairly popular time for weddings, so almost every venue is booked.  Another issue is that since this was going to be at a private residence, we have already bought about $1,500 in liquor and most ""wedding places"" won't let you bring and serve your own.

So, my fianc√©e is freaking out (trying to calm her down has actually had an overwhelming calming affect on me) and we don't have anywhere for the ceremony / reception anymore.  We can't change the date without fucking over a bunch of friends and family who have already bought plane tickets.  And, there is the honeymoon, too.  Can't reschedule that with work.

The caterers,wedding cake, dj, and bartenders are all flexible as far as changing the venue and so is the officiant (my brother).

This is her (hopefully) only wedding, and I have an understandable desire to make everything perfect.  I feel like I am failing miserably at the moment.

Does anyone know of a good venue that is somewhat unique and interesting that would be available June 11 that meets the requirements above?


TL;DR:  Can I have my wedding at your house?  We will clean up after ourselves.


EDIT: We are both atheists, and while this may sound snobbish or elitist or whatever, we find the idea of getting married in a church rather unappealing.  I know, beggars can't be choosers, but I'm not at the end of my rope just quite yet.

EDIT 2: Should have mentioned this in the original post, but we were expecting about 150 people.

EDIT 3: Thanks so much everyone for all the kind words and support.  And, some amazing ideas.  I am leaving my work now and driving to the hotel (it's about an hour) and then I am going to go through all these suggestions and figure this out.  I am much more optimistic about this than I was two hours ago.  My best man called me to tell me he saw this on the front page.  I promise to post how it went, too.

EDIT 4 (Last for tonight):  I said this in a comment below, but wanted to say it again where everyone could see it.  I was upset and cynical about this earlier because one guy (the venue owner) was a bit of a dick.  It is impossible to feel that way now.  One guy acted in his own interests, and over 800 redditors have commented and made terrific suggestions or just wished me well.  This is why I come here.  Just as I start to lose faith in humanity (I am not saying that this one event shook my faith in other people, it's a generalization), you people all remind me of how good other human beings can be to each other without any sort of motive or incentive (except comment karma?).  Thanks so much to everyone for your suggestions and kind words.  I again promise to post pictures of the special day, and update with something more than ""it went *okay*""
