"Uplifting pop anthems? (""You can do it"")",philnotfil,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/3qadln/uplifting_pop_anthems_you_can_do_it/,6,5,"A while back a friend sent me the lyrics to Katy Perry's Roar. She is not an artist that I would normally listen to, but I loved these lyrics. Rachel Platten's Fight Song was another that got my attention, and all of a sudden I had started a playlist called ""You can do it"". 

In addition to those two, I also have the following:  
Sarah Bareilles- Brave  
Chumbawumba- Tubthumping  
Katy Perry- Firework (who knew she was such a fount of inspiration?) 

There are a couple of breakup songs that also work for me:  
Kelly Clarkson- Stronger  
Demi Lovato- Skyscraper  

I tried dumping these into Pandora to find some more similar songs, but it is much better at giving me songs that sound similar than songs that have similar lyrical content. It did get me to Hall of Fame by The Script (and will.i.am), I had heard it before as theme music at sporting events, but didn't know what song it came from.

What songs are on your ""You can do it"" playlist?"
