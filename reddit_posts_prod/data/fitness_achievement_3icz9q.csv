Two Plate Bench finally achieved,Waaaghinator,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3icz9q/two_plate_bench_finally_achieved/,85,220,"I'm a 33 year old male, 5'11"" 173 pounds.

I have been lifting on and off for several years, though I must admit that most of the time has been ""off,"" and the time I have been ""on"" was unfocused and unorganized. Until a little over a year ago.

In June 2014, I purchased a half-rack and a set of Olympic weights for my basement.  I began a SL5x5 program and by January, 2015 my focus was laser sharp and lifting was a lifestyle habit.  MWF, my lifts continued to rise, but my bench lagged behind.  I had never been a strong bencher, and the thought of benching more than 175 pounds seemed ridiculous to me at the time.

Starting around February, 2015, I switched to Wendler's 5/3/1.  I stayed consistent, rarely missing any workout.  After the most recent cycle of 5/3/1, when I benched 195 for 4 easy reps, I knew it was time to test that 1RM.  Could I possibly bench two plates?  

Yesterday, I did just that.  I warmed up, slowly working up the weights. Eventually 200 pounds went up fairly easily.  Time to go for the gold.

When I looked at the bar sitting there with matching pairs of 45s balanced on each end, I got a little nervous, and then very excited.

Half way up, the 225 pounds got a little stuck.  I pressed on and finished my rep through the shaky sticking point.  Success!

235 would not go past that sticking point.  We will meet again 235... we will meet again.

Up next I will test my Squat and Deadlift 1RM and then start a cycle of Greyskull LP.  Looking to get stronger and stronger and stronger.

TL;DR: Bench was lagging, trained consistently, finally hit 2 plate bench which was a big goal for me."
