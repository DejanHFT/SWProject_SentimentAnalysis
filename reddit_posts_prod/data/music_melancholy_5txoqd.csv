Good melancholy EDM?,wingnut5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/5txoqd/good_melancholy_edm/,3,2,"I'm a total beginner when it comes to EDM, i'm more of a hard rock kind of guy, however, I love Seeb's remix of I Took A Pill In Ibiza and was wondering of songs with hooks very similar to that one or melancholy EDM like it. What subset would it be defined as too?"
