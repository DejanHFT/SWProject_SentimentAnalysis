How do you stay motivated?,Dimasaurousrex,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/31loyc/how_do_you_stay_motivated/,57,21,"Hey guys, I'm new to this subreddit and have recently started forcing myself to get in the habit of working out consistently. I always have a period of a few months where I stay super motivated then lose that motivation and before you know I'm back were I was when I first began or even worst in terms of progress

What are some ways you guys stay consistent? 

Also, any suggestions for me to get that same long term drive? 

Thanks ahead of time! 

EDIT: I'm going for DISCIPLINE over motivation now. Thanks guys! Gonna try to find a good workout plan and meal plan and get into a routine. "
