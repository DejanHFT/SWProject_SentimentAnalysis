Favorite Melodie’s from the last 30 years?,memyselfandeye,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/xcam1p/favorite_melodies_from_the_last_30_years/,1,0,I play guitar covers but most of my stuff is old (cuz I’m old.). What are your favorite melodies from recent decades?  Strong whistlable melodies are best as opposed to vibes.  I love Radiohead but can’t whistle much of it.
