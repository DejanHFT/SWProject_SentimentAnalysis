Melancholy Songs,Glingfram,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/b5upci/melancholy_songs/,9,2,"I'm looking for melancholy songs, some examples would be: 
Suzanne Vega - Tom's Diner
Primitive Radio God's - Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth...
Above & Beyond - Black Room Boy
Deftones - You've Seen The Butcher 

Music that evokes those sorts of emotions. Can anyone recommend songs? "
