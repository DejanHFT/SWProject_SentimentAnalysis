Culturally-relevant learning,makankousapdoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/hn9fa1/culturallyrelevant_learning/,4,5,"In *The Wire* S4e7 ""Unto Others"" Prezbo uses the games he's unearthed to make his lessons come to life for the students. He reasons to Ms. Donelly why his kids are playing with dice to learn probability that if you trick them into thinking they aren't learning, they do \[learn\]. It's amazing to (re)witness his character transformation from being unable to make eye contact with the blinded boy and own up for his thoughtless actions in season 1, to creatively thinking outside the box with his lesson planning.

I'm working to curate a toolbox for my own ELA and STEAM teaching arsenal and I'd like to gain your input. What are some other tools or resources you've seen or used to bridge a cultural divide in learning? How were they implemented? Those teachers who had to resort to distance ed due to the health crisis, were you able to engage with all of your students in the same way? What worked/didn't work?"
