Building a DIY DAP reusing old Android with Custom ROM,myself_shr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/168w6e3/building_a_diy_dap_reusing_old_android_with/,4,8," Hi, everyone,  
So basically I am dreaming of a very ambitious project which seems mostly impossible right now. So before jumping into the project i just wanted to know more about certain things. That's why i am posting here.  


I want build a DAP{or close to a DAP} reusing old android phones giving them some extra life and reducing e waste.  


**I want to achieve these following things:**  


***1. A DAP or close to DAP level sound quality.***  
***2. A custom Android OS containing only Audiophile related apps and programs and nothing else for clutter free music experience.***  


Now, I am seeking help from you guys to enlighten me with your knowledge and make this project possible. I am sure that if this project become possible some other enthusiasts might try this and give a fresh breathe to old phones.  


Thanks in advance. "
