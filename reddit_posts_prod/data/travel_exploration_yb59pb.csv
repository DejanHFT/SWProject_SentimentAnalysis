20 hours to explore Seoul,kaymono,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/yb59pb/20_hours_to_explore_seoul/,3,5,"Hello! I have a layover at Incheon for almost 22 hours. I got my Korean travel visa because I thought, why not use the time. 
What do you guys recommend that I should definitely visit and see?

I'll be staying at a Hotel in Incheon near the airport. My flight is landing in the evening around 6pm and then the next flight is at 3pm next day. So I will probably have the evening and morning next day to cover 1-2 areas. 
Thanks in advance for the recommendations!"
