What is a simple yet fancy and delicious dish to cook? (With no butter!),elcapitanL,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/15i9owl/what_is_a_simple_yet_fancy_and_delicious_dish_to/,10,0,"Anyone have any suggestions? Iâ€™m tired of just marinating chicken in parsley olive oil salt other spices etc.

For example, I love fettuccine Alfredo and chicken but unsure how to do something similar with no butter and get the same flavor. 

No butter suggestions greatly preferred. Thank you in advance."
