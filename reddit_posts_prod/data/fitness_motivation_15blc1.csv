Does anyone have some aerobic/cardio training advice or motivation for someone who hates running?,weskokigen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/15blc1/does_anyone_have_some_aerobiccardio_training/,51,29,"I am 20 years old, 5'7"" and at 160lbs. I haven't had a professional bf% check, but my electrical resistance scale says I'm at around 15%. 

I've only started seriously working out about 7 months ago, and would consider myself somewhat of a noob still. Over the course of those 7 months, I've both cut fat and made some strength gains. However, I think I might be plateauing in my cuts and need that extra push towards burning off the fat. 

I'll be honest, I've always hated cardio. My workout routine only encompasses weight training. However, it seems like adding cardio to my routine is the next logical step to continue cutting. I have friends who do long distance aerobic running, but I've tried and it was just too boring.

*However, I actually do want to start running*. Does anyone have some advice on how to begin and stay motivated while running? Any recommended training programs? Also any good android app I can download for my phone to keep me on track?

I feel like my abs are just beginning to peek out and I need that extra cut to get things showing. "
