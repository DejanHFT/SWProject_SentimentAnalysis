The 1980s were the best when it comes to catchy melodies and hooks,Heavenly_Noodles,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/uxgp6m/the_1980s_were_the_best_when_it_comes_to_catchy/,23,12,"It was a decade of earworms. I bet the melody to all these example songs instantly springs to most of your minds, even if they're way before your time:

* Karma Kameleon
* You Spin Me Round
* Little Red Corvette
* Nothingâ€™s Gonna Stop Us Now
* Need You Tonight
* Take On Me
* Like a Virgin
* Tainted Love
* Hungry like the Wolf
* Jump
* Girls Just Wanna Have Fun
* Jack and Diane
* The Boys Of Summer
* Word Up
* Cult of Personality
* Safety Dance
* Come On Eileen (this one in particular is insidiously catchy)

And on and on and on. Agree?"
