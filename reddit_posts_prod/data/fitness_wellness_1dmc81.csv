Starting Strength Works really well,Son_of_the_suns,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1dmc81/starting_strength_works_really_well/,37,17,"I decided to try doing SS and see if it would work for me. I had never managed to gain much muscle mass or strength and I have always been rather skinny and not particularly strong.

Now, after 16 weeks of SS, my muscle mass and strength have both gone up a lot.

I'm male, 29 years old and I'm 5' 8''

**Before** (Christmas 2012)

Weight: 150 lbs

Bench Press: 175 lbs
Squat: 180 lbs
Deadlift: 190 lbs

**After** (Today)

Weight: 170 lbs

Bench Press: 220 lbs
Squat: 300 lbs
Deadlift: 350 lbs

Starting Strength really works, if you have enough rest and recovery. I had a lot of milk, and my bulk was a rather dirty one.
