How do I critique movies?,C3Equalz,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/wjyc6l/how_do_i_critique_movies/,26,0,"Hello everyone, so I have always thought it would be a lot of fun to make a youtube channel where I review movies. The problem is, I don't really know how to do that. What I mean is that whenever I like or dislike a movie I can't really explain why I liked or disliked it, I just did but that obviously would not make for very good criticism. So I want to know how I could better understand why I like or dislike a movie."
