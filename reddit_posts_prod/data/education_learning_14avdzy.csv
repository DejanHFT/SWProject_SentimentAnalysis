Wanting to learn about the world of Cryptocurrency,schizophrenicsanta,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/14avdzy/wanting_to_learn_about_the_world_of_cryptocurrency/,2,0,I have some funds that i don't want to keep in the bank and lose their value due to current inflation rate which will easily beat the interest rates if i keep them in FD. I also want to increase my sources of income. I want to know where should i start and what all should i dive deep into. I would also love if i could get some tips that you would give a newbie or somethings that you would do if u could start over your journey of crypto.
