Military/mountain Tactical or atomic-athlete for a well rounded plan?,GalacticSpacePatrol,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6dy275/militarymountain_tactical_or_atomicathlete_for_a/,16,5,"Hey r/fitness 

I'm looking to find some kind of plan that is all around and not just lifting. I could just hodge-Podge throw together lifting and running etc. but someone smarter than me has probably already come up with some intelligent programming. 

I came across military/mountain fitness and atomic-athlete while searching and am wondering if anyone has experience with these programs efficacy?  Other advice/recommendations welcomed!"
