Help deciding on areas to explore in London on my last day.,DynastyFan85,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/14nzjfa/help_deciding_on_areas_to_explore_in_london_on_my/,7,1,"I will be in the Belgravia area early in the morning during a day of my vacation on July 13th, my last full day in England. I’m traveling from the US so this is my only chance to explore for a while. 

Option A: walk around Belgravia after breakfast, hop tube to Marble Arch, explore a few mews in Marlybone, walk to Regent’s Park, walk through park to Primrose Hill and explore Primrose Hill?

Option B: walk around Belgravia after breakfast, walk through Chelsea, Knightsbridge, over to Kensington/Kensington Palace Gardens and check out Hyde Park? 

Which would be a better option? I’m not looking to do museums just walk around and explore. 

Thanks"
