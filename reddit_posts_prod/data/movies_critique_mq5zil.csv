"When changing details or plots to beloved franchises, when or how should they be embraced or critiqued?",sammyjamez,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/mq5zil/when_changing_details_or_plots_to_beloved/,1,0,"This is mostly a reflection to my perspective of the Terminator franchise.

I mean, it is a dumb fun flick with some subliminal messaging added to it as well. It delves into themes like how technology will slowly destroy humanity, or the concept of fate, or whether time is already written or not.

And at the same time, the franchise had a lot of rewrites which would have been a lot better if the rewrites were done with better writing.

Like for example in Terminator 3, John is not the same as the one that we are used to though it makes sense given knowing that you are the future leader of a future that you do not know it will happen or not, it would give a person nightmares. Plus, the ending is quite an interesting case because judgement day was not prevented but the terminator still achieved the mission.
So in the end, the good guys do not technically win.

In the other films that were released after, they also had interesting ideas.

For example, Genisys had an interesting idea of making a reboot but with a twist where Reese goes to a past that is not the one that we are familiar with and the terminator came much earlier, possibly from a timeline that we never knew about but was never explained.

It would have also been interesting to make Skynet into an operating system which mimics how we are dependent on technology today, or showing how Skynet has evolved into having humans converted into terminators to make them more sophisticated infiltrators, or Reese trying to come to terms that technology can be just as helpful to humanity apart from its destructive capabilities.

But unfortunately, there was little room to explore this and the ending was not well earned either. The terminator does not die like in previous films and the ending is simply a cheesy happy ending where the protagonists do not say that they are expecting another terminator to arrive soon or be prepared for the next adventure.

Same thing goes for Dark Fate.
It would have been an interesting side story of delving into the idea of a what-if scenario and asking what if the terminator succeeded in killing John and Sarah had to come to terms with the death and have to deal with stopping Skynet on her own.

It would have been an interesting concept if she somehow encountered the terminator again and she had to come to terms with him because he is a machine and perhaps he has evolved to be more human.

An interesting concept was that Skynet became Legion.
Perhaps somewhere along the time, the timeline changed and Legion was created even though it is still technically Skynet.  Perhaps we would have seen a different version of Skynet with different technology or a different motive on why it wants to kill humans.

The issue would have been that this would have changed how time works in the Terminator franchise.


And in all, most fans view these changes as blasphemy ie heresy or trying to change a franchise that is already pure or working the way that it is.

And so I want to ask, when can changes or additions or alterations in beloved franchises should be accepted or critiqued and how?"
