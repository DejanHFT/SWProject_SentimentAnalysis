My boyfriend (24M) is too supportive of me(25F),FluffPuffpup,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9luet5/my_boyfriend_24m_is_too_supportive_of_me25f/,13,6,"My boyfriend and I have been friends for six years and we just started dating for one year. Things were fine for a while, but I have been having doubts since we started dating. While we have things in common and have our separate interests, I feel like he's too supportive to the point of not having his own goals. 

One example is I want to move out of the states. His reply was simply ""I don't care where we are as long as I'm with you"". Another is things like ""I'm satisfied seeing you satisfied"" and so on. 
He wants to go over the top being affectionate (like almost sappy Hallmark romance) and spoil me, but I'm not exactly the most lovey-dovey person in the world. I get frustrated because it feels like all his decisions are based on what I want and not his own or puts me on this pedestal. He keeps saying he isn't but it feels like it to me. He's had to put a restriction on himself because if you let him he will go all out on affection. But I feel like I'm being unfair to him, even though again he knows it gets over the top. I care about him, but it comes off a bit clingy sometimes.

Now I can easily probably write this off as me not being used to it. My past relationships sucked and was always an afterthought. And he never talks about himself or his plans/wants. 

It's been really weighing me down lately. I care about him but I don't know if I can keep dealing with this. Us getting together tore our friend circle apart and is just now getting put back together. If we broke up, he'd fall apart and never hang with me again, and I'm afraid my friends would hate me too after all the drama we put them through. I don't know what to do it's so stressful.

TL;DR boyfriend seems like he has no ambitions of his own, I'm suffocating and feeling like a POS over it. 

If you have any questions or need some extra detail I will reply. Thank you"
