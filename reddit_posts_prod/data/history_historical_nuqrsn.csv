What's your favorite historical spy story?,boppotib,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/nuqrsn/whats_your_favorite_historical_spy_story/,89,268,"Pretty simple question, but I wanted to share my own as well.

[Aleksandr Dmitrievich Ogorodnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Dmitrievich_Ogorodnik)

>Ogorodnik was betrayed by [Karl Koecher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Koecher),[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Dmitrievich_Ogorodnik#cite_note-4) a [Czechoslovakian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakian) translator working for the CIA, and was arrested in 1977. During his interrogation, Ogorodnik offered to write a full confession and asked for his pen. When the interrogator handed him the pen with a cleverly hidden cyanide pill in the cap, Ogorodnik bit on it and died soon after.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Dmitrievich_Ogorodnik#cite_note-5) He was said to have died before he hit the floor.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Dmitrievich_Ogorodnik#cite_note-:0-3)

I thought it was quite interesting."
