"How do you stay motivated when you hate working out, and progress is slow?",on__the__fence,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1ytqvy/how_do_you_stay_motivated_when_you_hate_working/,144,175,"I've always wanted a muscular physique.  About 6 months ago, I finally got the motivation to go for it.  Progress has been...slow.

I've been on a bulk, and doing Greyskull LP.  In that time, my lift numbers have gone up, though their still low.  And, I have gained some weight/muscle.  But, I have been disappointed in the amount of change I see in the mirror.  My chest is laughably underdeveloped, and my arms remain small.

I know, it's only been 6 months.  I can't expect to look like a badass so quickly.  But, I'm losing motivation.  On top of it all, I sitll haven't gotten to the point where I like going to the gym.

I'm constantly intimidated by going.  I don't ever want to go.  But, I make myself go.  I don't generally feel better afterwards.  Often, I feel worse.

I keep going because I'm trying to stay focused on my goal of a muscular physique.  But, my motivation is waning.  

How do you stay motivated?  How did you learn to love working out?"
