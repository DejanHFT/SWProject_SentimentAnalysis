Holy crap! I didn't expected this huge amount of feedback, thanks again r/Fitness

Answering some questions:
•Indeed as i can now understand why theres no gain, its because i dont eat that much or what i needed, cause i can tell you i'm not a pussy in weighlifting but obviously all this hardwork is going to thrash if theres no energy and protein to fill the gains. So i will eat more for sure!, but controlled and healthy.

•Routine: Again, it is affecting my gains as i dont follow a structured and stable routine, will start doing compound exercises everyday and follow a structured routine.

•Anyways thanks for the comments and recommendations!, i really really appreciate what you people did here and will try to keep you updated in to my now new challenge: gains gains gains

Background: Since i was a kid i used to be fat, increasing 22Lbs per year till my highest peak in 2014 at 189.2Lbs, then i finally decided to grab my balls and enter a gym.
Throught the course of 2015 i indeed lost a lot of weight (57.2Lbs to be exact) and i loved how my life changed, my confidence, my happiness and obviously my wellness overall.
Being fat as a kid was the worst experience of my life, and my biggest struggle as being a fat kid was having huge man boobs, literally they were massive and i hated them, so thankfully i got rid of them, well... kinda.

In the present i haven't stop going to the gym but i dont see the results i expected from the beginning.

I eat well, i don't eat sugar at all, i started weightlifting and taking protein shakes since January, but as you can see in the pictures i am not bulky, i have a lot of loosen skin and probably fat too since i dont know how to recognize it

I feel well wearing clothes on, but when i took my shirt off i fell disgusted as how i look behind them.

Now i am 5.6ft, 132Lbs and i have 16 years

All i want to ask are some tips and recommendations to improve my non-stopping challenge 

Excuse me for my english, a Costa Rican here...
Thanks r/Fitness!"
