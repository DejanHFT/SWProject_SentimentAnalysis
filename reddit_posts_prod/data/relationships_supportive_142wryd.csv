Advice for being supportive towards my (27NB) partner (26F) in regards to her spirituality when our belief systems are not the same?,dornishviper88,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/142wryd/advice_for_being_supportive_towards_my_27nb/,3,0,"Hi everyone! I'm looking for advice on how to be more present/supportive towards one of my partners (we've been seeing each other for about 5 months) when it comes to her spirituality.

For background, she's never referred to a specific religion/tradition, but she believes strongly in things like past lives, cosmic energies, tarot, spirits, etc, and it's something that's very important to her, especially lately because she's been undergoing a spiritual therapeutic process that mixes talk therapy with tarot, numerology, meditation and some other stuff. As for me, I'm an atheist, but more importantly, I was practically raised that way. Neither of my parents were religious, so I don't have any experience at all with any faith or spiritual beliefs or practices. It's just not something that has ever been present in my life, nor have I ever felt the need to engage with it or seek non-scientific, non-material explanations or guidance for anything. I don't think this makes me better or worse than people who do engage with that sort of thing, it's just always been something that's very, very far removed from my life.

So this means that whenever this partner brings up anything relating to her spiritual practices or beliefs, I'm kind of at a loss as to how to engage. I can't relate to anything she's saying on any level, so I basically only ask clarifying questions and say that I'm glad she feels like it's helping her (she'll often turn towards spiritual practices therapeutically/for comfort), but that feels pretty shallow. At the same time, it wouldn't feel honest or genuine to try to relate to it as if I also believe in the things she does, but also unnecessary to be too assertive about not believing it. So I guess I'm not really sure how to walk that line either.

Are there other people who've supported partners with wildly different, incompatible spiritual belief systems who have advice on how to engage more actively? Or if you have spritual beliefs/practices, what makes you feel supported in them, even by people who you know don't share them?

TL;DR - Need advice on how to better support a partner in regard to spiritual beliefs I don't share."
