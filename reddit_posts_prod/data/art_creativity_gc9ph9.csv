"""""""""Nihilistic optimism"""""""" ruins my creativity",MintIceCreamPlease,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/gc9ph9/nihilistic_optimism_ruins_my_creativity/,5,5,"Hello! 
I've been stuck, for a while now, in a state of mind that keeps me from doing art. 

You see, with the internet, it seems like we are constantly being bombarded by astonishing artworks, or simply things by which people expressed themselves creatively. 

The thing is, by seeing the ""best of the best"" (because there is not  ""better"" in art, technically everything should be subjective), I started to realize how worthless what I made really was, if someone made it better than me, after all, why would my art even matter ? 
So, realizing that, I just started to value emotions in art, thinking that the art people make to represents feelings and concepts mattered most that technical ability, since one's feeling is unique.

I then tried to express my own emotions.
I... didn'thave any idea, I am not particularly sad, nor angry. My motto keeps me from ruminating feelings, I often devaluate my own because I dont think they'll matter for long,  and I thus dont need to use art as a catharsis.
I tried to make some pieces of art to express things, but what things? What should I express if I dont have anything to Express?

Does anyone knows how to regain my creativity?
I would be really thankful.

TL:DR: 
How could I regain my creativity without particular things to express?"
