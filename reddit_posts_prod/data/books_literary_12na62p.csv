Food as a literary device: Dostoyevsky,cloren43,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12na62p/food_as_a_literary_device_dostoyevsky/,2,9,"I am in the midst of a very interesting course about food in literature and film. For my final project, I wanted to choose a piece of literature that isn’t typically what comes to mind when you think of “food book.”

I love Dostoyevsky, particularly The Brothers Karamazov, and thought this might be a good selection for the project as food helps tie in themes of faith/redemption and identity.  Are there other Dostoyevsky reads that may have more/better examples of food as a literary device? I’ve read many of his other books but for some reason Brothers K keeps popping into my mind."
