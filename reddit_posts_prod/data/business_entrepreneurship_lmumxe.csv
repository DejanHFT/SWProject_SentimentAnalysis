"Does the book ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" over-glorify entrepreneurship and business?",hardiklashkariwriter,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/lmumxe/does_the_book_rich_dad_poor_dad_overglorify/,4,3,"Recently, I was reading the book ""Rich Dad Poor Dad.""

While I liked the author's insights about managing fear and greed and make money work for us, I was a little fumed by reading the line:

***""A job is only a short-term solution to a long-term problem.""***

Why do authors have to demean jobs and jobs-doers and glamourize business and entrepreneurship to teach the importance of money?

Whether you're doing a job or a business, you should understand how money works. 

But saying that a job is only a short-term solution is not the right point of view.

What do you think? Are we over-glorifying ""quit your 9-to-5 job?"""
