Samuel Hunter - Mind and Body (Uplifting House),SamuelC_Hunter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/tz6ayk/samuel_hunter_mind_and_body_uplifting_house/,0,1,"Mind and Body - Uplifting Soulful House tune just dropped! Mind and Body is a soulful House tune with uplifting bass and chordal elements. Your hearts escaping but your mind knows better. Mind and Body explores the duality of love, attraction and how overcoming this ailment can give us immense release. Hope you enjoy, It was a blast making this song and it always gives me good vibes, hopefully you'll connect with it as well! You can support my music on my bandcamp page (Samuel Hunter)"
