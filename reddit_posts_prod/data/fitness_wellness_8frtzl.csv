"Reverse Crunches are a challenging exercise for the abs and core, but if they're still too easy, here are the progressions on how to make them harder for an even stronger core all around that gets your back and glutes involved as well!",Antranik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8frtzl/reverse_crunches_are_a_challenging_exercise_for/,81,4357,"###Link: https://youtu.be/rnQtIGJm20M

Hi everybody, Antranik here again. A couple weeks ago I posted a [video here](https://redd.it/8aoec7) showing how to do basic reverse crunches because they are much more effective at building a **stronger core** than regular crunches.

Now that you are acquainted with this wonderful exercise, it's probably not as difficult anymore and you can take them to the next level so that you could get stronger! (When you're able to do many reps of an exercise, you need to find ways to up the intensity: things that are harder make you stronger. ðŸ’ª)

#Level 1: Basic Reverse Crunches ([First video](https://youtu.be/iVVeZRlcuY4) covers the beginning of this)

1. On Fingertips
2. On Palms
3. Hands Up In the Air (New)

------------

In the [second video,](https://youtu.be/rnQtIGJm20M) I introduce the ""hands up in the air"" variation and then the ""bottoms up"" variation below... and I also show how to use a blanket as a prop to protect ya neck! Safety first!

#Level 2: Intermediate ""Bottoms Up""

1. On Fingertips (New)
2. With Hands Up (New)

------------------

**Recommended Modification:**

* The bottoms up variation is nothing new but nobody ever mentions how important it is to protect your freakin neck!
* Use folded up blankets placed under your upper back to reduce the neck flexibility required to perform this exercise properly. If you have lots of experience with the [shoulderstand in yoga,](https://i.imgur.com/3Y20E54.png) then you'll likely be fine, but if you don't, it's best you use that prop.

**Intermediary Progression tip:**

* If doing it both arms up in the air is much too difficult, yet doing it with both arms down is far too easy, then you could do it with one arm down and the other up as an interim progression.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you got any questions, comments and please contribute with tips on how YOU take these to the next level!"
