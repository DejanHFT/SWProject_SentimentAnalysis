Study: Gut Microbiome Determines Motivation to Exercise,Tyrosine_Lannister,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ztvup2/study_gut_microbiome_determines_motivation_to/,371,2541,"Last week, a study came out showing that the amount of dopamine an animal's brain releases when they exercise depends on their gut bacteria. Microbiome composition impacted how much the animals would run, both in a forced endurance test and on an exercise wheel in their free time.

It looks like a definite cause-and-effect thing: the high-exercising trait could be transferred to other mice by transplanting their gut bacteria. 

Really wild implications for everything from diet to antibiotics--even cannabis use; it looks like the effect was mediated by the cannabinoid receptor. 

Wanted to share it here because ""mind over matter"" is a big thing, but...well, minds are made of matter, and this implies that exercise genuinely is just easier for some people than for others.

Some good layman-level coverage of the article is here:

So: thoughts? I'd be curious to hear if anyone here has experiences that align with (or contradict!) this perspective, e.g. if antibiotics killed your 5K time, or hot sauce is your secret to a good workout or something"
