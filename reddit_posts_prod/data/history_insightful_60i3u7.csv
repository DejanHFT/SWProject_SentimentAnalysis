Recommendation - US history book for dummies,EskiciDukkani,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/60i3u7/recommendation_us_history_book_for_dummies/,9,2,"Hi, I have recently moved to the US (from Turkey). 

My interest in politics eventually started to itch my interest in US history as well. Being a foreigner and not having taught of anything about US history in my school years for obvious and very fair reasons, I lack a lot of fundamental knowledge. So here I ask you guys, is there any book that you could recommend which basically lays out and summarises the game-changing issues/incidents in US history from the very first settlements to modern times?

Zinn's ""A people's history of the US"" is apparently very popular reference book, but I thought that might be too insightful for me for now. Any book with a little bit of shallower depth would be very helpful.

Thanks!"
