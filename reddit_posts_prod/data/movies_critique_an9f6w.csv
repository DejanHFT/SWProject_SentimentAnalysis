What qualities do you critique a movie on?,dabbin_z,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/an9f6w/what_qualities_do_you_critique_a_movie_on/,14,0,"What are some things you look for in a movie that makes it standout?  Some of my favorite movies for example, have really strong characters that bring the film to life.  Others would be the mood a shot of cinematography conveys.  I am mostly interested in learning what makes a movie good as apposed to average.  What are some of your thoughts on this?"
