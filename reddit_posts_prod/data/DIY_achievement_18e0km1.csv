How can I make this myself?,random_normal_person,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/18e0km1/how_can_i_make_this_myself/,1,0,"I love this piece and am not going to spend the $3k that it costs. I figured I can make an approximation myself (to hang at home, not for resale). I was wondering if anyone knew how to do this? I could probably get an acrylic red circular mirror, but the float mount and the wood frame is giving me trouble. It looks like a lacquered background and these types of frames (sturdy enough to mount a mirror) are pretty rare.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated, thank you! (And pretend I'm stupid, so don't say things like ""just mount the mirror."" I would need to know how to do it to achieve this effect.) Thank you!
