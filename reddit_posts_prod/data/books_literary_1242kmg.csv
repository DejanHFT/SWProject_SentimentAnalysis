How long would it take to read all of Dostoevsky's literary opus?,ScroedingersParrot,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1242kmg/how_long_would_it_take_to_read_all_of_dostoevskys/,12,1,"What is the shortest amount of time one would need to spend to achieve this and how difficult would it be, both mentally and physically? I suppose this is a good way to really get to know a writer - by reading all he offers. But how long would that take; are we talking a quick month or maybe a whole year? I think Dostoevsky has something more than 30 works - novels, novellas and short stories (and some other things which are in the minority). I believe this would be a daunting task, especially when we take in consideration his novel lenghts and themes which he chooses for them. So, what do you think?"
