Unwanted inspiration,Prince_Zinar,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/ti9a69/unwanted_inspiration/,6,0,"What do you guys do when you are writing a character and you suddenly realize, ""Damn, this character feels really similar to a character from a manga/anime/show/game"" 

Right now I'm writing a character that is supossed to be:

1. Tall
2. Black Hair
3. Big Sword
4. Strong
5. Softly edgy/Gloomy looking

And if you're at least a little knowledgable about Manga, yes, I can't get Guts out of my head and it's killing me. Even though I've barely started reading Berserk, I know who Guts is. I don't know his whole life or his story, but it's still in my mind when I write this character and I don't want to unconsciouslly make a character inspired by Guts.

I know that Berserk didn't create Tall guys with big swords, but it's the first character that comes to my mind. I also know that being original in these times is really hard, since a lot of stuff is already created and there's always something similar to another thing, I don't really mind it, I just don't wanna make it too similar without even realizing."
