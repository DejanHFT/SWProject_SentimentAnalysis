Fun adventures in Latin America that don’t involve tour groups,Throwawayforgainz99,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/11j3skm/fun_adventures_in_latin_america_that_dont_involve/,2,1,"I don’t know about you guys, but if there’s one thing I hate, it’s being herded like sheep down a hiking trail with other people. 

What fun adventures have you guys had in LA that didn’t involve a guide?

For my gf and I, it was going to the San Blas islands in Panama. 

I really just want to rent a canoe and go canoeing through the Amazon, but you can’t. I understand why because of the deadly animals/environment and what not, but still. 

Anyone else share similar feelings?"
