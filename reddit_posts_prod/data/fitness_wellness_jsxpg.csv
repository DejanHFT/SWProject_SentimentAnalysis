Program/Diet Round-Up:  Whatcha doing and how well is it working?,Chr0me,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/jsxpg/programdiet_roundup_whatcha_doing_and_how_well_is/,64,16,"Just curious to know what everyone goals currently are and what you're doing to get there?  Would you recommend it to others, and have you seen any results yet?  I'm personally biased for weight training, but it would be interesting to read experiences with other types of fitness programs too.

I was following SS from Feb until about a month ago.  My primary goal was fat loss so I was operating on a pretty significant caloric deficit.  Managed to get some pretty good newbie gains while losing about 20 lbs, so it worked out well.  However, I was constantly feeling beat up and finally had enough.  So I started eating more but then my weight loss stalled.  

I currently don't have the time to tweak my diet to get things ""just right"", so I've devised an intense PSMF diet for myself.  I intend to follow the diet for the next 4-5 weeks until I can comfortably fit in the 220 lb. weight class for my first powerlifting meet in October.  It's just a personal goal not to have to lift in the 242 lb. class and I don't want to have to deal with cutting right before the meet.

I'm following Wendler's ""5/3/1 for Powerlifting"" and determining my accessories by paying attention to how I fail on the three main lifts.  I then do 45 mins of low/moderate intensity cardio on a spinner bike on my off-days. Strangely, I miss feeling obliterated like I was with SS, but I'm still making gains (albeit, slower).  But considering how little I'm eating, it's a good choice to maintain without killing myself.  After my diet, I'll probably explore Rippetoe's Texas Method to get more squat volume or possibly some Smolov/Smolov Jr. stuff.  I just feel that my body is still capable of more than what I'm getting out of 5/3/1."
