The hymn was sung by a chorus of twenty-seven maidens and the same number of youths on the occasion of the Ludi Saeculares (Secular Games)! I know that this is a real melody as I've sung this in the past but with made up lyrics! As I said, this is a real melody but I don't know the name of it or the lyrics if it has any!
