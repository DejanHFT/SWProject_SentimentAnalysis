Scout explore website,ktgrok,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16rtgtu/scout_explore_website/,0,2,Anyone figure out how to add a place to more than one day on the itinerary? Or have a better but similar website to suggest? I like being able to see it on the map to figure out which day to do what and the clear format unlike the jumble of ads on wanderlog.
