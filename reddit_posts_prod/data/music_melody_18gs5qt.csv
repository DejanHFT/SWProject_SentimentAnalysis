"Hot take: if you rip off another artist's melody and lyrics, even if you get permission and give credit, it's still plagiarism.",Son_of_Kong,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/18gs5qt/hot_take_if_you_rip_off_another_artists_melody/,7,0,"I'm not talking about sampling, per se, although I do think it often crosses the line these days, and I'm not taking about suing for copyright over chord progressions, which is ridiculous, but lately I've been hearing a surprising number of songs that just lift a melody and lyrics from another song, maybe changing it ever so slightly, and present it as an original part of the song. Just three examples off the top of my head: 

* Dirty Heads, ""Rescue Me"" vs. RHCP, ""Dani California""

* Beyonce, ""Hold up""  vs. The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, ""Maps""

* David Guetta, ""I'm Good"" vs. Eiffel 65, ""Blue.""

I don't care if you call it an homage and put a credit in the liner notes so you don't get sued. It's sheer artistic laziness, and I call that plagiarism."
