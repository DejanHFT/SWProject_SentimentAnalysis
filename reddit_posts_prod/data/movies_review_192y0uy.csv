Who are some great movie parents? (Inpsired Ebert's reviews of Juno and Easy-A),Billy3DWilliams,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/192y0uy/who_are_some_great_movie_parents_inpsired_eberts/,411,755," From Ebert's [review of Juno.](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/juno-2007) It reminded me how great JK Simmons and Allison Janney were in that film. Theyexuded parental warmth


> Juno informs her parents in a scene that decisively establishes how original this film is going to be. It does that by giving us almost the only lovable parents in the history of teen comedies: Bren (Allison Janney) and Mac (J.K. Simmons). They're older and wiser than most teen parents are ever allowed to be, and warmer and with better instincts and quicker senses of humor. Informed that the sheepish Paulie is the father, Mac turns to his wife and shares an aside that brings down the house. Later, Bren tells him, ""You know, of course, it wasn't his idea."" How infinitely more human and civilized their response is than all the sad routine ""humor"" about parents who are enraged at boyfriends.


From his Easy-A review.

> ""Easy A"" takes this misunderstanding and finds effortless comic variations in it. The news is taken with equanimity by Olive's parents, Dill and Rosemary (Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson), who join Juno's parents in the Pantheon of Parental Admirability. 


Who else should join this pantheon of great parents?"
