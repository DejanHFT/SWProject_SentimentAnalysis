"Advice on Wood Chair Arm Repair, Deep Gouge",DersOne,https://imgur.com/a/yIQhTo6,0,2,"Looking for advice on an achievable repair for a wooden chair arm for a novice to woodworking.  I dropped something on the chair that has left a deep gouge in the arm as pictured, approximately 1"" long and 1/8"" deep.  Having researched repair methods, here is what seem to be my three options:

1) Sand, fill with putty, paint to mimic grain and stain color, lacquer to seal

2) Sand, fill with sawdust/glue/stain mix, sand to shape once hardened, stain, lacquer to seal

3) Sand to smooth, no fill, stain, lacquer to seal

Any advice on what may work best based on experience?  I'm sort of leaning more and more towards option 3 and living with the indent to avoid having an obvious discolored spot from the filler, but if it's possible to create a well-blended patch then I would try that route.  All of the guides and videos I've reviewed seem to suggest the fix with fillers will be a reasonable approximation but also assume the surface will be painted and not stained.

Thanks in advance!"
