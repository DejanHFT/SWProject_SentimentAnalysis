It will be released in the UK on April 21. A release date for the US has not been announced. The second part *The Three Musketeers: Milady* will be released in France on December 13 this year. Here are some of the latest reviews (in English and French) for *The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan*. Would love to hear your thoughts on it if you've already seen it...looks like viewers in the US aren't going to be able to see it anytime soon, and even people on r/AlexandreDumas don't seem to have seen it yet!
