Are future generations (of humans) valid objects of philosophical and/or moral inquiry?,mahany25,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/qs1ol/are_future_generations_of_humans_valid_objects_of/,8,10,"There exists, or will come to exist, a set of data which can describe the entire molecular history of space-time. At this point in the distant future, the joy of human beings that lived beyond 2012 will be equivalent, in terms of desirability, as the joy of human beings that live presently or in the past.

Consequently, should we not inform every decision that we make with sustained considerations of how it will affect future generations? In particular, anything that tends towards premature extinction of the human species therefore disables or removes from existence the potential joy (and suffering) of human beings.

More radically, such a contemplation, abiding by strict Utilitarianism, seems to endorse dramatic actions, such as mass sterilization, if they would ensure the biological continuity of the human species. Is this not a valid way of reasoning?"
