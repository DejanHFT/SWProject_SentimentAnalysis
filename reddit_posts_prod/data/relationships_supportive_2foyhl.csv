My friend [20/F] is upset with me [20/F] for not being supportive during her pregnancy scare,friendshipproblem,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2foyhl/my_friend_20f_is_upset_with_me_20f_for_not_being/,56,0,"I've been best friends with a girl,that we'll call Sam, for two years now. We are incredibly close. In addition to Sam, I'm really close to another girl that I'll call Mary. The three of us are best friends and we're always together. 

I just want to give a little bit of background on our friendship. I haven't always been the greatest friend ever. I'm in a relationship with a guy that I love very much as we've been dating for two years in November. Lately, I've been having problems in my relationship because my boyfriend is graduating ahead of me and we've been worried about long distance. He is from Russia and is not an American citizen and we've been trying to figure out how we will make our relationship work. I want to marry him and I know that we'll be married someday, but the thought of us being in a ldr for at least a year is scaring me because I can't bear to be without him.

Also, he has been dealing with depression but he is refusing to get therapy so it's hard for us right now. Because of this, Sam and Mary have often accused me of neglecting them for my boyfriend and I can see why they would say that because I probably see them once or twice a week.

On the other hand, I have been a great friend to both of them and when Sam was dumped cruelly, I helped her deal with the breakup. 

Anyway, Sam has been with a guy for about 5 months now and she is so sure that she loves him but it's a little annoying for her to say that she loves him when they've been dating for such a short period of time. They don't even have arguments, and I always tell her that love isn't easy! She always gets offended when I mention love and I really don't mean to be annoying to her. 

For example, about a month ago, I was telling her how my boyfriend was refusing to go to therapy and how we have had arguments about it. I mentioned to her that she'd understand when she falls in love that love is by no means easy and is very hard. She seemed upset and made a remark about how love shouldn't have to be hard. She is so naive and I was only trying to help her.

Yesterday, Sam sent me a text saying that her period was late. She mentioned that she would buy a test the next day when CVS opened but she just really needed to see me because she was freaking out. Understandingly, my dorm is about 5 minute walk to hers so I could see why she would think it was a reasonable request, but I was watching a movie with my boyfriend and I was enjoying our limited time together (we only have one year before he graduates). Sam didn't know that I was watching a movie, but that doesn't change the fact that I can't just leave my hubby in the middle of a movie.  She sent another text about 5 seconds later saying that she couldn't stop sobbing and it felt like her life was falling apart. I didn't respond immediately and kind of forgot about it.


About two hours later, Mary is talking to Sam on the phone venting about an unrequited crush and Sam is being very supportive, telling her how she'd find love someday. Sam then asks Mary if I'm in the apartment (Mary is my roommate) and if so, can she ask me to respond to her texts. She then says that she knows that I usually respond hours later, but it's kind of urgent. Mary says that she'll give me the message. I tell Mary that I'll text Sam as soon as the movie ends and she gives me a weird look. 


Today, I text Sam asking her if everything was okay and she sent an email that said,

""Yes, I am okay now but don't you worry about it. I have always been there for you. You have had THREE pregnancy scares and each time I have dropped what I was doing to support you. I have always dropped what I was doing to support you. I even walked to your dorm in an ice storm when you thought that [boyfriend's name] was going to break up with you. Whenever Mary or I need you for anything, you respond to us hours or days later. Before the start of each semester, you promise us that you won't neglect us for [boyfriend].

 Because you bring up the issue first, you **know** what you're doing. When [her ex] dumped me last year, I told you what he did to me and I needed you but you wanted to hang out with your boyfriend. Sure, you were there for me after and I really appreciate that. But that day, I was extremely suicidal. I'm better now, but that's how low I was. There are issues that I can't talk about with Mary, like my pregnancy scare. I am a freaking engineering student and I thought of all that I was going to screw up. On top of that, you keep implying that I don't know what love is and so I can't possibly love my boyfriend.I no longer want you in my life"".

An hour later, Mary texts me that she needs some time away from me. I ask her if Sam put her up to it and she says that she didn't even know that Sam and I had a falling out. 


I think that they're overreacting. I want my friends back. They are my absolute best friends. How can I make this up to them? It hurts to see Sam and Mary hang out without me.

**tl;dr**: Friend is mad at me for not being there for her during her pregnancy scare and I need to make things right."
