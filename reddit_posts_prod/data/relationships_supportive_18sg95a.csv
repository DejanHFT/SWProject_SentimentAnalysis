My friend wants me to support her bf's visa application,Fit_Effect_3915,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18sg95a/my_friend_wants_me_to_support_her_bfs_visa/,6,4,"Hi everyone, I'm looking for some advice for a situation with a friend of mine (late 20sF).  I hope this is the right place to post.  Sorry for being a bit vague, I'm trying to protect everyone's privacy to the best of my ability.

My friend has had a long distance boyfriend for a few months now (maybe 5 or 6? Not sure exactly).  She and he live in different countries.  They have met in person a few times but their communication is mostly online.  I don't know how old he is, but I think he must also be late 20s/early 30s.  Recently, they have decided that he will move to her country so that they can live happily every after together or something.  I've been watching the whole thing unfold from a distance and honestly I think she's nuts.  I'm worried about how fast things seem to be moving.  From what she says, he sounds like a perfectly lovely person, but to my mind if that's true, he'll still be a perfectly lovely person in a year or so.

Anyway, that's the background.  The crux of the matter is that she's trying to bring him to her country by personally sponsoring his visa, which I think is an unbelievably terrible idea.  I've been trying to dissuade her from doing this but clearly I haven't been getting through to her because this morning she messaged me to ask if I could provide her with a message of support for the visa application.  I really don't want to do this.  What goes on in her love life is her business, but I'm scared that she's tying herself financially to a man she's only known for a few months (and most of that has been online).  How do I talk to her about this?  Am I being too judgemental of her relationship?

TL;DR: friend wants me to write a letter of support for her bf's visa application and I want to decline/warn her that this might not be a good idea."
