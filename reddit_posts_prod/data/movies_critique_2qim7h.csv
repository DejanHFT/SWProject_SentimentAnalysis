"Are certain people more ""qualified"" to critique films than others? Is there a certain objectivity to what's good and bad in a film?",thenoisewall,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2qim7h/are_certain_people_more_qualified_to_critique/,36,5,"People always throw around the statement that all art is subjective and is just meant to question, which is kind of cliched imo. Why is it that a person who deems Transformers better than Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or something be taken as seriously? I'm not saying people shouldn't have the right to enjoy certain things, but it just really bothers me personally when people tell me that i just have ""hipster"" taste or something. Makes me feel like i'm taking crazy pills."
