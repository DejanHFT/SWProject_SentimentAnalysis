"Historians of Reddit, what's a significant, historical event that happened primarily because someone was bored?",practicalpants,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2d4mbq/historians_of_reddit_whats_a_significant/,235,326,"If not due to boredom, laziness would also be fine.

Maybe it's a decision to launch a war, landmark legislation, birth of new institutions, I'm not really sure what to expect.

I want to avoid the general, psychological reduction that people only really do things because they are bored or something of that nature... looking for specific events that can be directly attributed to a certain person's (or group's?) boredom.
