He left me for his abusive ex and days later wants my support because she’s abusing him again.,Avengelina254,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zdoxlw/he_left_me_for_his_abusive_ex_and_days_later/,150,321,"
So my m(42F) ex(36M) of a few months just broke me. Destroyed my heart. We were the perfect couple our lives matched together like a puzzle, no arguments just pure happiness. I was on cloud 9 and we were already head over heels in love. He always told me that the one person I never had to worry about was his ex as she was abusive and he would never go back with her. Well last week he left to another state to visit his kids and while he’s gone he blocks me on everything. I knew in my gut why but I was still so confused. The day he came back I was able to message him on the one social media he forgot to block me on and lo and behold, he tells me he is back with his ex. Instant heart break, like I’m broken.  

We arrange to exchange items left at each others houses and end the conversation. Next day I get a VM from his ex who hacked into his VM and found a message I left and called me telling me they are together. I ignore it. Then here comes the texts to include pics of them naked in bed while I was at home missing him. I tell him to call her off before I lose my temper and he tells me that she is blowing up his phone and already belittling and emotionally abusing him. All I could do was say “You chose this, I can’t feel sorry for you. You had a girl who treated you like gold and you broke her to be abused and belittled” a few hours later he texts me and I ask if he’s ok and he say he’s not. He keeps calling me to tell me more crazy stuff she is doing to him and how bad it is. This has all happened within a week. My wounds are still bleeding. I feel like I should be there for him but at the same time I’m so angry and hurt from what he did to me. Part of me wants to hold on and hopes for the “I was wrong leta get back together and part of me wants to walk away forever. I don’t know what to do!! If you were in my shoes what would you do?

TLDR: He breaks my heart and leaves me for his abusive ex and now I feel bad for him because she’s already abusing him again within a week."
