What do you consider to be your country's literary masterpiece?,okokokok1111,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tjj3n7/what_do_you_consider_to_be_your_countrys_literary/,684,466,"I'm Italian, but I feel much more interested in foreign literature than Italy's. So i was wondering what people hold in the highest of regards so that i could give it a try, as i'm quite interested in reading classics (although there could be some modern pieces too).

As for Italy, the very obvious answer would be Dante's Divine Comedy. Every single Italian student has to study it for a reason. Metaphors, symbolism, allegories, some absolutely brilliant wordplays, alliterations and such that make some extremely well-sounding verses. All of this written more than 700 years ago. My teacher costantly makes references to it when explaining many other works from centuries later as analogies with a part of the Divine Comedy can very, very easily be drawn in a way or the other.

A personal famous of mine is the short story ""Rosso Malpelo"" by Giovanni Verga. It's only 8 or so pages long, but it is so impactful in a weird way, as Verga's style is the opposite of what i generally like. All you get is an internal narrator that lays out what seems to be a rough outline of a miner's story, with no actual insight on the characters explicitly laid out. The narrator merely describes what he sees and what has happened. However, hidden underneath this seemingly dull style there are so many interesting things to unpack and interpret that are nicely tied up by a rather sad and existentialist theme about death and facing suffering."
