Drill suggestions,Randomname8675309,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/16dt3au/drill_suggestions/,4,2,"I’m invested in dewalt because my father bought a bundle in the mid 90’s. I updated that bundle ten years ago I reckon to the 20v lithium. 

His drill is a dc759. The drill works. But I want a lighter more powerful drill. 

I bought a dcf885 impact driver, works very well. And a dcd780 drill, Chuck broke in like a week. I’ve been using my dads drill since. 

The impact driver is fine, but maybe outdated at this point. I don’t need contractor grade tools. But I can afford them if necessary. 

Starting over is fine. My goal, which I’ve yet to achieve is to drive a wood screw through wood with a drill and no pilot hole. 

That doesn’t seem like a lofty goal, but I don’t know. Maybe I should just get my drill fixed? Where do I do that?"
