What are some historic medical treatments that worked but would look outlandish to someone today?,Iphotoshopincats,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/4ckaxq/what_are_some_historic_medical_treatments_that/,1237,1272,"To elaborate I was watching an episode of 'horrible histories and the segment historical hospital came on ( [like this but this is not the exact one we watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lXgG88Xx8Q) ) and this segment was all about treatments that had a backing in modern science and were replaced main because more advanced treatment came along but now would look barbaric.

This peaked my interest ( i know i know it took a children show to peak a 32yo mans curiosity about history ... don't judge me ) I  read all the time about past treatments that never worked but not much on what ancient races got right so curious what examples you history buffs can come up with    

(also i posted this in /r/AskHistorians and my post was deleted so if this is also the wrong sub if someone could be so kind and direct me to the correct one)"
