Do you think we'll be seeing literary work inspired by anime soon?,HarleeWrites,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/17qz9se/do_you_think_well_be_seeing_literary_work/,72,31,"I grew up mostly consuming video games/anime and only got into reading and writing when I was a teenager. As an adult now, though I enjoy reading classic literature and stuff we consider normal in terms of Western markets and tradition, I still find myself consuming more video games and anime than prose. After being published traditionally in different forms three times and feeling unfulfilled, I now endeavor to serialize web novels written for fellow anime/video game fans. They take inspiration in terms of themes of friendship, found family, and absurd fights/powers/magic systems. 

It seems to be a common consensus though that it's not a compliment for someone to say that your writing sounds like anime. It's an insult that almost sounds derogatory to me, and I'm unsure if it's because some sort of elitist clash between mediums of storytelling exists or because I have a flawed insecurity giving me that perception. When I was in my first year or two of writing, it was a piece of critique I often got. Nobody says such things anymore because of my improvement over a nigh decade, but I'd argue my work is more anime than ever despite my development as a writer and wider reader. 

So, do any of you know any examples of recent work that breaks the boundaries or bridges the gap between mediums? The only author I can think of is Brandon Sanderson because I've seen him mention stuff like manga and Bloodborne before, but he's Brandon Sanderson. We base our standards on normal humans. As mean or elbow-patched as it sounds, writers of even the most popular stories on the platforms I use just don't seem to be big readers simply because their prose tells me that. I struggle to find those with similar enough goals to study and model myself after. So, like, am I searching for an oxymoron?"
