How do I be more supportive (F)19 M(19),Thick_Cartoonist_265,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/rbjnf9/how_do_i_be_more_supportive_f19_m19/,4,1,"My bf  has recently disclosed to me his desire to be more into the 'goth' clothing style. I personally was surprised since I never, well he didn't seem like the type of guy to want to indulge fully into this fit of style. Personally I love the style he has going on, but ever since we dated he disclosed how he loved my dark aesthetic theme, (I dress sort of goth) and he loves it. He asked if I could help him figure out the style for him in men. And he was very open with me that he felt insecure so he never tried this style back in our school days for fear of bullying.

I honestly don't know anything about Goth, or the style. I don't know how far he means by wanting to be into it. I do want to be supportive and help him. But is it bad I don't want him to change? I really love the way he presents himself already. And I don't know if I can see his style change. I would still be supportive the best I could either way but I guess I just need some advice from people on how do I stop myself from telling him not to persue that style or change.

TL;DR : boyfriend wants to be Goth and I don't want him to"
