Piano Black Polyester Finish (HOW)?,MichelMaillet,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/163j04l,4,1,"Hi, I added 3 photos.  I bought this clock yesterday from MarketPlace and I thought it would look amazing in a nice shiny smooth Piano Black Polyester Finish.  Like the piano in the second picture.  Does anyone know what I need to do, the type of paint or powder that I am supposed to use and the types of top coats needed to achieve that Polyester Piano Black Finish?  I have the same type of finish on a wooden box that I got which came with collectible coins that I have and that’s the finish that I want to achieve with this clock.  See third picture for picture of the wooden box.  I have tried researching videos on YouTube but all they talk about is how hard it is to repair the polyester finish but I haven’t found a DIY video yet on how to actually achieve that finish with step by step instructions."
