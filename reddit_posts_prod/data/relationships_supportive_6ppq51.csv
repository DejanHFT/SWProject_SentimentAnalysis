"I (20f) want my fiance (22m) to be supportive. Instead, his constant commenting is making it worse.",oo-delally,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6ppq51/i_20f_want_my_fiance_22m_to_be_supportive_instead/,41,24,"I (20f) have not yet gotten my driver's license. I never had need for it when I was younger, I used public transportation/walking. I took drivers ed, and got my permit, but with no car/no reason for a car, I never got a license.

Since I started dating my fiance, he doesnt want me walking about St. Louis by myself, and has insisted on driving me everywhere. But that got old, so he wants me to learn to drive his car. But I am scared to try.

I want my fiance (22m) to be supportive and we have tried on multiple occassions to go out and have him teach me. But he has a bit of a short temper and I am a perfectionist so we both get frustrated and stop after about 10 - 15 min. 

Lately, we stopped doing that and he has just resulted to try and bully me into getting it. I get comments probably 2 or 3 times a week about how our lives would be easier if I drove. I know it's true, but having not driven in 4 years, I want to be comfortable in a car before taking the test. Humiliation of doing something wrong is my biggest fear, and then also disappointment if I don't pass. The pressure that he is putting on me seems to be amplifying my stress, and I dont know how to ask him to back off. 

Are there any suggestions you all have of how I can practice without pressure to be perfect? How should I ask him to lay off of me and describe that it's not helping my situation?

Tldr: I haven't driven in 4 years, fiance wants me to. I want to learn but I'm scared and his attitude of pressuring me into it is amplifying my stress. How do I explain that he is making the situation worse? Any tips on how to practice?"
