"Here are my favorite simple, cheap, and delicious meals from when I was broke as a joke",WinterHill,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/2pt8zw/here_are_my_favorite_simple_cheap_and_delicious/,157,419,"Anyone who already has a good recipe for boiled water should be able to make these. These meals got me through some lean times and allowed this bachelor eat something other than ramen most nights. On top of that, they tasted great.

**Poverty tacos** - Take a flour tortilla, add a scoop of refried beans, some chopped up onion, and a bit of cheese (any kind). Roll it up like a mini burrito. Done. If you want to get fancy you can add hot sauce or salsa, corn, lettuce, sour cream, etc. This costs about $0.50 per taco. 2 will make a meal.

**Chili-mac** - Prepare 1 box mac & cheese according to directions. Add 1 can of chili. Stir. Done. You can add variety with different kinds of chili. This meal costs about $4 and can feed 3-4 people.

**Spaghetti & hearty meat sauce** - Brown 1 lb of ground beef, drain, and set aside. Chop up 1 onion, 1 pepper, and a couple cloves of garlic, and toss in a large pot with a few tbsp of oil and a teaspoon of salt. Set over medium heat until the veggies are cooked through. Add a large plastic jar of Ragu pasta sauce to the pot. Add the ground beef and stir. Heat everything up and simmer for 30 mins. Prepare 1 lb of spaghetti according to directions. Done. This meal costs about $10 and can feed 4-5.

*Now we're gonna get a bit fancy here - save this one for date night. This meal is delicious and appears sophisticated and expensive, but it's actually really simple and dirt cheap:*

**Linguine & mussels with garlic white wine sauce** - Heat 1/4 cup oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Finely chop 4 cloves of garlic, add to pan and cook until brown. Add 5 tablespoons butter and 1/2 cup white wine. Get this simmering and lay a dozen cleaned mussels down in the pan in the sauce. Lower heat and cover pan. While this simmers, prepare 1 lb linguine pasta according to directions. After 10-15 min, most of the mussels should open up, indicating they're done. Set them aside. Discard any mussels that didn't open or have cracked shells. Mix pasta with sauce, 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese, and salt and pepper; you should need about 1 teaspoon of each. Top pasta with mussels and serve with remaining white wine. This meal costs about $25 (including wine), and will feed 2 with plenty of pasta left over.

If you live far from the coast and can't get cheap mussels like I can ($1.99/lb!), frozen shrimp will work just as well. Just thaw them overnight in the fridge beforehand, and you'll only need to cook them in the sauce for 3-4 minutes.

Anyways, I hope these recipes can help someone else when they're out of cash. Delicious food doesn't need to be complex or expensive!

Anyone else have any cheap, delicious favorites?
