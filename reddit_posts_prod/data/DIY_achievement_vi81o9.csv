Extending stair treads,midgt214,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/vi81o9/extending_stair_treads/,32,119,"We are currently building a home and the stairs that are being installed are prefab concrete stairs (not our choice).  I would like to install LED strips on each stair - but for this to be feasible I would need to extend the stair treads so that an overhang is created where the LED strips can be mounted.

From the bits of info I could find online - the general advice seems to be to mount OSB board (along with a vapour barrier) to each stair - and then proceed from that point forward.  Our stairs will have gluedown vinyl as a top surface

Are there any other factors I need to take into consideration (apart from the need to raise the top floor to be the same height as the final stair)?

I've added some renders below on what I am trying to achieve (These don't include the required finishing touches like covering the OSB with the same material etc)
