Are there any examples of a culture accidentally forgetting major historical events?,Kethlak,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/obsy81/are_there_any_examples_of_a_culture_accidentally/,908,4753,"I read a lot of speculative fiction (science fiction/fantasy/etc.), and there's a trope that happens sometimes where a culture realizes through archaeology or by finding lost records that they actually are missing a huge chunk of their history. Not that it was actively suppressed, necessarily, but that it was just forgotten as if it wasn't important. Some examples I can think of are Pern, where they discover later that >!they are a spacefaring race!<, or a couple I have heard of but not read where it turns out the society is on a ""generation ship,"" that is, a massive spaceship traveling a great distance where generations will pass before arrival, and the society has somehow forgotten that they are on a ship. Is that a thing that has parallels in real life? I have trouble conceiving that people would just ignore massive, and sometimes important, historical events, for no reason other than they forgot to tell their descendants about them."
