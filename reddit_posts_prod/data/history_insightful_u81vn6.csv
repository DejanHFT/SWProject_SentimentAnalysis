President Wilson at the Paris Peace Conference,morbie5,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/u81vn6/president_wilson_at_the_paris_peace_conference/,157,653,"After World War I President Wilson went to the Paris Peace Conference. He was there for 6 months working on a peace treaty to formally end the war. My question is who ran the federal government back home while Wilson was in Europe? I have never be able to find an answer to this question so maybe someone can get me some insight.  


I understand that the executive office staff was almost nonexistent 100 years ago but it seems to me that someone should still have been in charge. Did the department heads just go about their daily business with minimal input from the president? Was Wilson routinely sending directives back stateside over electronic telegraph?"
