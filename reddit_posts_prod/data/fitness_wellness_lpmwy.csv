"When I go for a morning run, am I burning away purely fat or other excess calories or am I potentially losing muscle as well?",3rdFunkyBot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/lpmwy/when_i_go_for_a_morning_run_am_i_burning_away/,206,269,"Hope this isn't a dumb question.

edit: Thank you everyone for the insight and discussion. Moral of the story - I don't have to worry much about losing muscle unless I run a hell of a lot and don't eat. "
