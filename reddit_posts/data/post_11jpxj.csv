How far are we from Artificial Intelligence or Singularity?,threenoms,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/11jpxj/how_far_are_we_from_artificial_intelligence_or/,4,1,"What do AI and tech experts think?  Is it too unpredictable to tell?

[Some of Ray Kurzweil's predictions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Ray_Kurzweil#Post-2045:_.22Waking_up.22_the_Universe) have turned out to be pretty accurate.  His most recent prediction for singularity is 2045.

I think his prediction is based on advances in computing power but I feel like 2045 is still too soon as we still don't really have a firm grasp on how our own brain works or how ""consciousness"" is structured.

What do you guys think?  Would we see AI or singularity in this century?
