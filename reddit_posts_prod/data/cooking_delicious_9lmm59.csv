**NO.1 PORK CABBAGE FILLING \[白菜猪肉馅\] (40-50 Dumplings)**

* Ground pork 400 grams
* 1 egg
* 2 tsp of grated ginger
* 1/4 cup of diced scallion
* 1.5 tbsp of soy sauce
* 2 tsp of sesame oil
* 2.5 tbsp of homemade garlic chili sauce (It is optional. If you decide to skip it, be sure to adjust the saltiness and add some garlic in this recipe)
* Fresh shredded cabbage 600 grams (season with some 1.5 tsp of salt and squeeze the liquid out you will end up with about 350 grams of cabbage)

**INSTRUCTION**

* You will need some cabbage. Remove the center stem. Slice the white part of the cabbage. Because this part is a bit harder than the leaves so we also gonna roughly chop it a little bit. Then slice the cabbage leaves thinly as well.
* Season the cabbage with some salt. Mix it well and let it sit for 20 minutes. The salt is going to pull out the moisture from the cabbage. Then we are going to squeeze the cabbage. The trick here is not to let the cabbage sit for too long. You want to remove just enough water and the cabbage still able to provide moisture for the filling. For 600 grams of fresh cabbage, after the squeeze, I got about 350 grams of cabbage left.
* Put all the ingredients together: ground pork, egg, grated ginger, diced scallion, soy sauce, sesame oil, the cabbage that we just prepared, some homemade garlic chili sauce (This is an optional ingredient. It is something that my family uses all the time. It provides a little spicy kick. If you decide to ship it, make sure you adjust the salt amount and add some grated garlic in this recipe.)
* Here comes the tricky part, We seasoned and squeezed the cabbage so it is hard to know how much salt is left in the cabbage. If this is the first time you are making it, you can cook a small amount in the microwave. Taste and adjust the saltiness.
* Stir and throw the filling to develop the texture. And I will show you an extremely easy way to wrap dumplings. Just fold the wrapper in half and pinch the edge to close it. This recipe is enough to make 40-50 Dumplings.

I pan fried them which is my favorite way to cook dumplings. I like how they are nice and golden brown, Super crispy. I always think cooking is like magic. You will never guess how delicious this can be just by combining some comment ingredients together. Cabbage provides a lot of moisture while cooking, with pork together, they create an amazingly juicy and incredibly soft filling. No wonder why it is the NO.1 classic filling that you must try.

**NO.2 SPICY BEEF FILLING \[牛肉馅\] (40-45 big dumplings)**

&#x200B;

**INGREDIENTS FOR THE FILLING**

* 500 grams of ground beef
* 2 tsp of grated garlic
* 1 tsp of grated ginger
* 1.5 tbsp of soy sauce
* 1 tsp of salt
* The spice mix we made
* 1 egg
* 1/3 cups of beef stock or water
* 1/3 cup of scallion
* 1/2 cup of diced onion
* 1/3 cup of diced cilantro
* 2 tbsp of hot oil

**INGREDIENTS FOR THE SPICE MIX**

* 5 pieces of hot dried chilies
* 1 small piece of cinnamon
* 1 piece of bay leave
* 1 piece of star anise
* 1/2 piece of black cardamon
* 4 piece of clove
* 1/4 tsp of white pepper
* 1.5 tsp of Sichuan peppercorn

**INSTRUCTION**

* Let’s start by toasting some spices. You will need 5 pieces of hot dried chilies. It is optional if you don’t eat spicy food. 1 small piece of cinnamon, 1 piece of bay leaves, 1 piece of star anise, 1/2 of a black cardamon, 4 pieces of clove, 1/4 tsp of white pepper, 1.5 tsp of Sichuan peppercorn.
* Toast them on low heat until they release the aroma. Keep an eye on the Sichuan peppercorn because it is easier to get burned. You don’t want it to turn black or else it brings a bitter flavor. The chilies might have few spots that are black. It’s normal, don’t worry. Once there are nice and fragrant, put them in a blender. Grind it into a fine powder. Set that aside and we are putting all the filling together: 500 grams of ground beef. 2 tsp of grated garlic, 1 tsp of grated ginger, 1.5 tbsp of soy sauce, 1 tsp of salt, The spice mix we just made. Crack in 1 egg and add 1/3 cups of beef stock or water. Longtime subscriber probably already know this method. I like to add pretty much a lot of liquid to the beef filling so the dumplings will come out juicy. The beef stock I used is unsalted. If you use salted broth, you will need to adjust the saltiness in this recipe.
* Mix the ingredients until the meat absorbs the liquid. Then stir it within one direction to develop the texture. Bring the filling to a high position and throw it back into the bowl. Do this for a few minutes. The meat part is done. Next, we are going to add the aromatics: 1/2 cup of diced onion, 1/3 cup of scallion, 1/3 cup of diced cilantro. Some hot oil to active the aroma. Also, The fat ratio of this ground beef is pretty low, adding oil can make up the shortness. Mix them well and your filling is done.
* For this filling, I like to use a bigger and thicker wrapper so I can wrap as more fillings. Who doesn’t like that? Put a lot of filling in the middle of the wrapper. Use both of your thumb and forefingers to stretch the wrapper then fold that in half. Pinch the edge together and squeeze the dumpling with the hollow of your palm. In this way, you create a fat dumpling with a fat stomach. This recipe is enough to make about 40-45 big dumplings.

I boiled them. This is called Shui jiao \[水饺\] in Chinese, which means water boiled dumplings. It has a soft but still firm skin. The texture is totally different than pan-fried dumpling skin but still amazingly delicious. If you cut one open, the juice will run all over the plate. I served it with a spicy soy dipping sauce. It was incredible. If you love beef dumplings, you must give this a try.

**NO.3 MUSHROOM & CHICKEN FILLING \[香菇鸡肉馅\] (30-35 dumplings)**

&#x200B;

Chicken and shiitake mushroom are popular couples in Chinese cuisine. Chicken meat contains less fat compared to pork and beef so it is easy to get dry while cooking. Mushroom is kind of like soft and slimy. It will help a lot in texture and flavor. I like to use dried mushroom, fresh mushroom doesn’t have that intense umami flavor.

* 350 grams of ground chicken meat
* 1 tbsp of soy sauce
* 1.5 tbsp of the water that we soaked the mushroom with
* 1/2 tsp of salt
* 1/4 tsp of white pepper
* 1 egg
* 3/4 cups of diced rehydrated shiitake mushroom
* 3/4 cup of diced carrot
* 3 tbsp of scallion

Soak some dried shiitake mushroom with water for 4 hours or overnight until it is nice and soft. You just touch the little mushroom stem and see if it is soft because that is the hardest part to get soaked. Squeeze all the water out. Slice it thinly. Then diced it. We need about 3/4 cup of diced mushroom for this recipe.

In a large bowl, add in some ground chicken. I use chicken thigh because it gives much better mouthfeel for the filling. You could use chicken breast. It will just be slightly different in texture. Keep adding 1 tbsp of soy sauce, 1.5 tbsp of the water that we soaked the mushroom with, 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/4 tsp of white pepper, crack in 1 egg. Mix it until they are well combined. Then stir the filling within one direction and throw the filling back into the bowl to develop the texture. Do this for about 5 -8 minutes and we can add the rest of the ingredients: 3/4 cups of diced shiitake mushroom, 3/4 cup of diced carrot, some spring onion. Mix this until well combined, you filling is done.

I will show you another way to wrap dumplings. Fold the wrapper in half. Start making pleats on 2 sides. Each side I like to do 3 pleats. Reinforce the edge so they don’t open while cooking. This is like the classic dumpling shape.

This recipe is enough to make 30-35 dumplings. I pan-fried them. They are beautiful and golden brown. I serve it with a ginger shallot dipping sauce. It is so delicious and classic. If you cut one dumpling open, you might don’t see that much juice compare to other dumplings but the mouthfeel is amazing, great texture which is the result of adding the mushroom.

**NO.4 SHRIMP & BAMBOO SHOOT FILLING \[冬笋虾仁馅\](40-50 dumplings)**

&#x200B;

Longtime subscriber probably know that I made this recipe before. Today’s post is a collection of all kinds of dumpling filling so I want to put this recipe here just because it is so delicious and popular. I have used it as the egg roll, and Siu Mai filling as well.

* 10 ounces (283 grams) of peeled shrimp
* 8 ounces (226 grams) of ground pork
* 1 tbsp of soy sauce
* 1/4 tsp of white pepper
* 1 tsp of sugar
* 1/2 tsp of salt
* 1 tsp of grated ginger
* 2 tsp of grated garlic
* 1 tbsp of cornstarch
* 1 egg
* 3 tbsp of water
* 2/3 cup of the minced baby bamboo shoot
* 2/3 cup of minced carrot
* 2 tsp of sesame oil
* Carrot slices or parchment paper to prevent stickiness
* Steamer required

**INSTRUCTION**

* You will need some shrimp. Grind half of it and cut the other half of the shrimp into smaller bites.
* Add some ground pork and we can season our filling: 1 tbsp of soy sauce, 1/4 tsp of white pepper, 1 tsp of sugar, 1/2 tsp of salt, 2 tsp of grated garlic, 1 tsp of grated ginger, 1 tbsp of corn starch, crack in 1 egg, and some water. Start mixing the filling. In the beginning, it will be pretty watery. You just keep stirring it until all the liquid is gone. Throw the filling back into the bowl for few minutes. Now it should be less watery. Last is the veggies: 2/3 cup of minced carrot， 2/3 cup of minced baby bamboo shoot (笋丁), and a drizzle of sesame oil for some nutty flavor. Mix everything until well combined. If you noticed, I always add the veggies at the end, that is because vegetables will slow down the process of developing the meat texture.
* To wrap the dumplings, I am using the glutenous free transparent wrappers. It is made with wheat starch instead of wheat flour so the edge is no smooth. Wet the wrapper with some water and Put some filling. we are using the same wrapping method that I did with the chicken dumplings. Fold it in half and make pleats on each side. The starch wrapper is very delicate, do it gently.
* Put it in a steamer. I also use some carrot slices to prevent stickiness. Steam it for 25 minutes on high heat and you are done.

I didn’t serve it with any dipping sauce because it is that delicious. The shrimp is sweet and fresh. The bamboo shoot provides some crunchiness. So good! If you like shrimp, or if you like dim sum, you must give this a try.

**NO.5 VEGETARIAN DUMPLING FILLING \[糯米素菜馅\](50-60 dumplings)**

&#x200B;

* 1.5 cup of glutinous rice or regular rice
* 1 + 1/3 cup of water that we soaked the mushroom and the black fungus
* 1.5 tbsp of soy sauce
* 1 tbsp of soybean paste
* 2 tsp of dark soy sauce
* 1 tsp of sugar
* 2 tsp of vegetable oil
* 2/3 cup shredded cabbage
* 2/3 cup shredded carrot
* 2/3 cup rehydrated shitake mushroom
* 2/3 cup of rehydrated black fungus
* 3 tbsp of diced onion
* 3 tbsp of diced scallion
* 3 tbsp of diced cilantro
* 2 tsp of grated garlic
* 2 tbsp of hot oil
* 3/4 tsp of salt or to taste
* The rice we cooked
* 1 egg

**INSTRUCTION**

* You will need some dried mushroom and black fungus. Soak it in water for 4 hours or until they are nice and soft. I only used 10 grams of dried black fungus. They become much bigger in size after rehydrating. Squeeze the water. Slice them thinly and dice them.
* Next, we are going to cook some glutinous rice. It is also known as sweet sticky rice. It has a unique aroma. I like it a lot. You can also use regular cooked rice. It just won’t be as gooey as glutinous rice. Rinse it several times until the water is clean. Drain it completely. I am using a small pot to cook it. If you have a rice cooker, it will be better. Use the water that we soak the mushroom with to cook the rice. It has so many flavors, don’t waste that. Bring the rice to a boil and then down to low heat to cook it until all the water is gone. It is ok even If the rice is still a bit undercooked, because we will cook it more after we wrap it into the dumplings.  
* Next, we will add some seasoning to the rice: 1.5 tbsp of soy sauce, 1 tbsp of soybean paste, 2 tsp of dark soy sauce, 1 tsp of sugar, 2 tsp of vegetable oil. Mix that together. And pour it into the rice. Mix until you don’t see any white rice. You can taste it to adjust the flavor. Mine was perfect.
* Putting this in a plate just to let it cool down a little bit.
* While that is sitting, let’s put all the ingredients together: 2/3 cup minced carrot, 2/3 cup shredded cabbage, the black fungus, shiitake mushroom, 3 tbsp of diced onion, 3 tbsp of diced scallion\*\*,\*\* 1/4 cup of diced cilantro, 2 tsp of grated garlic, 1/2 tsp of salt. Pour 2 tbsp of hot oil to active the aroma. Give them a mix. It smells so good already. Add in the glutinous rice and crack in 1 egg
* Mix everything until well combined. You don’t need to stir the filling within one direction, because the glutinous already decided the texture for this filling. It is going to be gooey and sticky.
* Ok, I will show you another way to wrap this dumpling. Same as always, you have to fold the wrapper in half. Pinch the edge and pack it tightly. Make sure there is no air inside. Start making pleats along the edge. It is like making empanadas. I guess you can call it Chinese empanada.

I pan fried it and serve it with my favorite spicy dipping sauce. It is so delicious that wouldn’t believe it is vegetarian. It is super aromatic and soft inside. I also deep fried another batch. The skin is nice and golden. It is so crispy. One of my taste testers says it like the egg roll. I guess you can also use this filling as vegetarian egg roll filling.

**HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN FILLING**

Those are five filling examples I want to share. You can take them and make it tonight, they will be perfectly delicious. Now let’s talk about how to create your own fillings. As the examples that I show, FILLING = PROTEIN + VEGETABLES + SEASONING + AROMATICS & SPICES. If you are vegetarian, you can use tofu, noodles or rice instead of meat. Here is a picture of some ingredient ideas that I organized: [**https://imgur.com/a/BMZdsXX**](https://imgur.com/a/BMZdsXX)

A lot of people think about making fillings is dumping a bunch of ingredients together which is kind of true but the tricky part is how to find the balance between MOISTURE, TEXTURE, AROMA, and FLAVOR. Here are some tips that I learned. Some of them just examples, some of them you already see me doing it in my videos.

**First, is the Moisture. This is the soul of a juicy filling. There are 3 cases you need to be aware with.**

1. Sometimes, if the ingredients have too much moisture, then you need to find a way to pull it out. For example, we season the cabbage with salt. Other vegetables like eggplant, Chinese radish, cucumber, you need to do the same thing. This method is called 杀水 in Chinese.
2. If the meat is too dry or the fat ratio is low, then you need to add moisture to the filling, such as egg, water, stock, oil. Some vegetables also can do the same job such as cabbage, radish, mushroom, sweet corn.
3. If the filling is too wet and you cannot pull it out then you can add something to absorb the moisture. I have made a beef potsticker video. In that recipe, I add a lot of stock to the filling on purpose but it makes beef very watery and hard to wrap so I used the mashed potato to absorb excess water. The final product turned out amazing.

**Next is the Texture. There are many ways to upgrade the texture.**

1. The most important one is how to mix the filling. I do this all the time: Stir the meat within one direction and throw it back to the bowl. This method is called “Jiao Da Shang Jin 搅打上劲”. It tangles up the proteins and emulsifies the fat, so it gets sticky and the cooks evenly.
2. Using roughly ground instead of finely ground meat (chicken, shrimp, pork) will prevent the filling from being mussy.
3. When making meat fillings, I always add the vegetable ingredients at the end because veggies will slow down the process of developing the meat texture.
4. Carrot, bamboo shoots or any crunchy vegetables can provide some crunchiness. Mushroom makes the filling less dry and has a better mouth-feel. An egg can make the filling more springy and uniform, less grainy and separated
5. If you want to make a more meat, less vegetable filling, use a high-fat ratio cut or add some oil to the filling. It will give a softer filling.
6. When making vegan dumplings, mashed potato, cooked rice, and starch can hold the filling together because most vegan ingredients don’t come together well.

**The third is Aroma. There are many ways for you to maximize the aroma.**

1. A splash of hot oil can active the herb aroma. I have done this many times, not just for fillings, also noodle, dipping sauce. It smells so good as soon as the oil touches the aromatics.
2. When you use dried spices, you can toast them to maximize the fragrance.
3. For some recipes (pork & chives, beef & fennel filling, anytime you use a big amount of aromatic), we will add some cold oil to keep the freshness of the herbs. Oil can wrap the open cuts of the herbs and prevent it from producing water and getting soggy.
4. Ginger and Chinese cooking wine can remove some unpleasant smell from the meat.
5. Some dried ingredients have unique aroma such as dried shrimp, dried radish, dried mushroom.

**The fourth is flavor: make it to your own preference, but there are a few things I want to point out**

1. Some processed food already contains sodium such as Chinese pickle, baby shrimp skin, sausage. For these ingredients, you need to be careful when adding salt.
2. For Chinese light soy sauce, the salt ration is about 18%, which means for every 1 tbsp of soy sauce equals about 3.2 grams of salt (a little bit more than a half tsp of salt)
3. Some ingredients can be used in different ways depends on how you like it. For example, you can add raw egg into the filling or scramble it and add it to the filling. Also, fried shallot and fresh shallot have different flavors too.
4. Blanching the ingredient can remove some bitterness such as bitter melon, mustard leaf. This method is called Chao Shui 焯水in Chinese. Chao Shui also helps to pre-cook some ingredients. You can use this on sweet corn or carrot cubes if you decide to put it in your dumplings.

Having said all that, this is just the beginning of dumpling filling tips. If you know anything that I didn’t mention, please leave a comment so we can all learn.
