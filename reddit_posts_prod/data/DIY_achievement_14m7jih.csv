My very first table makeover,Skyree01,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14m7jih,14,87,"So I got this water damaged ikea table on a marketplace. I've been wanting to do makeover for a while and been watching many epoxy videos.
Note: the tabletop is made of MDF, not a solid piece of wood.

I processed by scrapping down all the bumps, adding wood paste to fill the nooks and crannies and sanding it flat.
I covered the whole tabletop with white primer to make sure that even if my epoxy is not completely opac it wouldn't look bad.
Next I mixed my deep pour epoxy with white paint and a bit of white mica powder. I had a smaller container of epoxy with silver mica powder to draw the marble vein.
Luckily it didn't leak too much thanks to the masking tape, and I avoided having many bubbles by using a kitchen blowtorch. After a week of curing it was ready for sanding.
I sanded it up to 500 grit, then up to 1000 grit in wet sanding. Last step was polishing with a polishing pad and some liquid polish compound.
It still needs a finish, hesitating between polyurethane or rubio monocoat oil.
For the leg I just spray painted with a cast-iron effect paint, love the industrial style it gives.

There are many little mistakes but overall I'm really happy with the result for a first time.
It's obviously not good enough to sell but oh well üòÅ"
