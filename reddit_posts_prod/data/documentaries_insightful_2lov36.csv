The Great War (1964) - this WW1 series was made by the BBC on the 50th anniversary of the war and includes interviews with soldiers who fought on both sides. It's a fascinating watch and gives a completely unique insight into what it must have been like for those who fought and the rest of society.,BedSideCabinet,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxK-qR14pVg&list=PLdEBPyoq11-7H07u7iwGM_3l-_QfxFj9B,39,662,No text content
