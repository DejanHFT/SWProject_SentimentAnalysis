I think I'm done watching horror movies at the cinema.,dnlszk,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/bb09ji/i_think_im_done_watching_horror_movies_at_the/,402,425,"Recently I went to the cinema to watch *""Us*"" by Jordan Peele. I personally liked the movie quite a lot, but that's not what I want to talk about - and vent a little.

Going to the movie theaters for horror movies has seemingly become a terrible idea lately. I don't know how it has been in your area lately, but around here it's getting really awful. 

The room always gets filled with groups of young adults - the old enough to drive but not old enough to have finished a college degree kind of young - who heard from an acquaintance or read/saw somewhere on the internet that the movie ""IS SO SCARY OMG"", so they seemingly feel the urge to be super macho and let everyone know how they're not scared because I guess they think that makes them look cool? You know the ones, they laugh out loud at scenes that are supposed to be scary, keep saying that the ""movie sucks"" and other stuff that just annoys everyone else and ruin the experience. It's totally okay and perfectly normal to not like a movie, but you really don't need to let everyone know it and be so loud about it. Fear is completely personal and irrational, it's okay if you're not scared of something that someone else is, but shut the fuck up about it.

There's also the occasion where someone on the group is totally scared of pretty much everything, and the other ones are there to make fun of the scared one - sometimes it's a couple where one gets scared easily and the other doesn't. It's maybe even worse when this happens, because they feel the need to interact with each other in such a way that lacks all respect for everyone else in the room who just wants to watch the movie and know how to behave in a cinema.

In the latest occasions I've tried my luck at the cinemas for horror movies that I can remember, only one out of four was fine, which was when I saw *""A Quiet Place""* but I guess it was just because it was an earlier session in the afternoon instead of a late evening one and it was probably the last week of the movie on the cinemas, so there were three or four people in the theater besides me and my girlfriend. The other three times - for *""It""* (2017), *""Hereditary""* and now *""Us""* \- were all awful experiences thanks to the complete disregard of these groups of people for the fact that they weren't in their own house and there were other people in the theater trying to watch the movie. 

The worst one was definitely when I watched 2017's *""It""*; I went with one of my friends and we bought tickets in the middle of the row, then a group of six or seven people decided they wanted to sit on the same row, but we would split them and they seemingly didn't care. There was a couple - boy and girl - to my left, then my friend and the rest of them to our right, and the girl would get scared of every single thing that happened during the movie (she also liked to scream) and to our right was the jerk who had to look and lean in the direction of the girl to look at her being scared, and then laugh to the rest of the group. Sometimes he'd jokingly say to her ""come on, this ain't scary at all"" as if there weren't anyone else in the room. 

TL;DR going to the cinema for horror movies is turning into a bad idea because people either don't know how to behave or don't give any fucks."
