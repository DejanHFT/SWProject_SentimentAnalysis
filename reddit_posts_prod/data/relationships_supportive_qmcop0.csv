My gf [20F] of two years has suggested an open/poly relationship to sort out her sexuality. I [23M] am supportive but afraid.,VoltageHero,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/qmcop0/my_gf_20f_of_two_years_has_suggested_an_openpoly/,19,2,"Probably going to post this on other subs to get a diverse list of opinions, and I don't care enough about people prelims through my comment history to use an alt. I'm also sorry if this is very rambly, this is a conversation we had only a few hours ago and I'm still trying to sort my feelings and thoughts.

My gf and I are both gay, myself being pan and her being bi, and we have both been dating for about two years. The problem is that while I had the opportunity to explore my sexuality prior to meeting her, she had only really been taking steps to accept her sexuality when we first met.

To rephrase, I had the chance to confirm my sexual identity while she did not.

When we first started dating, I gave her the blanket statement of her exploring her sexuality, to figure out who she was and at the time she declined. 

To avoid lengthy posts, or giving out too much private details, she has within the last month came back to the idea of experimentation.

Now, don't get me wrong. I'm totally on board with her exploring her sexuality and l think it's extremely important to her happiness, which of course should be her main concern anyways. 

That said, the way I confirmed my sexuality was through hookups. For me, that's really all I needed. For her though, she needs the emotional connection and the experience of going on dates with someone before even having sex, and that's my main problem.

For me, a romantic relationship means *a lot*, and while it's definitely unhealthy, I feel as if currently I put her at the top of my support chains, and I personally couldn't see holding two people at that same level. In my perspective, that lessens the amount of love or importance someone has to you. 

At the risk of sounding extremely selflish, I'm really afraid that I'm going to lose her. She says now that it's entirely possible (and likely according to her) that she'll determine that it was mediocre and that was it, but there is also the chance that she'll realize she's outright a lesbian and that will obviously end things on our end. 

I have the fear that the most extreme outcome will happen, she'll find someone, and I'll be left with heartache. 

Furthermore, I don't really have any romantic interest in being with anyone else *besides* her, at the time.  While I have a passing interest in rejoining something like Grindr, it's also something I highly doubt I would follow through with. 

While it's a valid relationship choice, I don't think I'm polygamous, and I honestly think that's closer to what she's suggesting than a simple open relationship (we're both pretty inexperienced in the area)

In my heart of hearts I know that letting an open relationship is for the best, that I should be happy for her to figure out who she truly is. I know that I should be able to move on if she ends up deciding to break things off...

But at the same time, it's *hard* to not be afraid, and I don't know how I should set boundaries, or how I manage these fears and concerns in general. Of course, talking to her can clearly happen but I also just want advice as to how to manage a situation like this, and if I'm being too selfish. 

**TL;DR:** My gf wants an open/poly relationship to sort out her sexuality, and while I'm supportive of her finding herself, I'm also very fearful of her finding someone else and becoming monogamous with them."
