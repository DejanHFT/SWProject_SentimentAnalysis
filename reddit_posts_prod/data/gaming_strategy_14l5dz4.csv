Do other players have the same frustrations about Strategy and Tactical games ?,raiskader,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/14l5dz4/do_other_players_have_the_same_frustrations_about/,9,8,"I just played Frostpunk again the other day, and I found myself being bored very quickly by the ""endgame"" finding it very redundant in the things to do, as I didn't find enough different and exciting events to continue.

I find this very frustrating in strategy and Tactical games, it was like this when I played other games like XCOM. In the latter stages of these games, I find myself looking at the redundancy of enemies and map layouts, and it usually makes me drop the game right before the end.

The feeling is also not helped when playing games that have a bigger RogueLite element, and you can tell some enemies are not playing by the same rules as you, or you just lose because somehow the game got a freebie, just to add some lifetime to the game.

Is it a frustration others have too ? Would love to hear what you guys think about it"
