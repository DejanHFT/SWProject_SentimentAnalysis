'Tenet' Review Thread,SanderSo47,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/idzio1/tenet_review_thread/,1290,1300,"[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tenet): 78% (41 reviews) with 6.98 in average rating

> Critics Consensus: A visually dazzling puzzle for film lovers to unlock, Tenet serves up all the cerebral spectacle audiences expect from a Christopher Nolan production.

[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/tenet): 71/100 (18 critics)

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie.

> The sheer meticulousness of Nolan’s grand-canvas action aesthetic is enthralling, as if to compensate for the stray loose threads and teasing paradoxes of his screenplay — or perhaps simply to underline that they don’t matter all that much. “Tenet” is no holy grail, but for all its stern, solemn posing, it’s dizzy, expensive, bang-up entertainment of both the old and new school. Right now, as it belatedly crashes a dormant global release calendar, it seems something of a time inversion in itself.

-[Guy Lodge, Variety](https://variety.com/2020/film/reviews/tenet-review-christopher-nolans-grandly-entertaining-time-slipping-spectacle-is-a-futuristic-throwback-1234742936/)

> Altogether, it makes for a chilly, cerebral film — easy to admire, especially since it's so rich in audacity and originality, but almost impossible to love, lacking as it is in a certain humanity.

-[Leslie Felperin, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tenet-film-review)

> It may echo the cleverness of Rian Johnson’s “Looper” and Shane Carruth’s “Primer” in its dizzying disregard for linear chronology, but the plotting is muddled rather than complex, with less to say about the flow of time than “Interstellar” or “Memento.” In the end, “Tenet” isn’t one of Nolan’s most satisfying films. But after I’ve seen it four or five more times, maybe I’ll change my mind.

-[Nicholas Barber, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/tenet-film-review-christopher-nolan-john-david-washington-robert-pattinson-bond/)

> The depth, subtlety and wit of Pattinson and Debicki’s performances only becomes fully apparent once you know where Tenet is going, or perhaps that should be where it’s been. Still confused? Don’t be. Or rather do be, and savour it. This is a film that will cause many to throw up their hands in bamboozlement – and many more, I hope, to clasp theirs in awe and delight.

-[Robbie Collin, The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/tenet-review-dont-try-understand-it-just-rewind-enjoy-ride/): 5/5

> ""Tenet"" is big and ambitious, but Nolan is more caught up in his own machinations than ever before.

> Tenet is not Christopher Nolan’s masterpiece, but it is another thrilling entry into his canon. In a world where blockbuster cinema is dominated by franchises and sequels, it serves as an accomplished demonstration of the pleasures of unconnected and non-serialised original storytelling. But while it does tread new ground, Tenet is the ‘safest’ film from Christopher Nolan in some years. Following two recent ambitious movies from the filmmaker, Tenet feels a little conservative, as if Nolan’s style is a franchise rather than a framework. Despite this, it remains more interesting than most other tentpole movies and acts as a beacon for the director’s strengths. In a time when cinema is struggling through arguably its most difficult time in its entire history, Tenet works as a fantastic reminder of what blockbuster filmmaking can aspire to be, and why it’s best experienced in a huge, dark room.

-[Matt Purslow, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/tenet-review): 8.0 ""great""

> No other artform could quite present such a collision of time, place, idea and emotion, and it’s clear that Nolan’s pure intent is to give us the utmost of what this medium can uniquely provide. At its best this is a ride that manages to be viscerally thrilling while still being emotionally and intellectually engaging, all in ways that are truly, uniquely cinematic. In other words, say what you will about the tenets of Tenet, at least it has an ethos.

-[Jason Gorber, /FILM](https://www.slashfilm.com/tenet-review/): 7.5

> Once again seizing control of the medium, Nolan attempts to alter the fabric of reality, or at least blow the roof off the multiplexes. Big, bold, baffling and bonkers.

-[Alex Godfrey, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/tenet/): 4/5

> The world is more than ready for a fabulous blockbuster, especially one that happens to feature face masks and chat about going back in time to avoid catastrophe. It’s a real shame Tenet isn’t it.

-[Catherine Shoard, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/21/tenet-review-christopher-nolans-thriller-is-a-palindromic-dud): 2/5

> Though it’s sometimes hamstrung by clumsy dialogue – a necessary evil, perhaps, given how much Nolan needs to explain – Tenet is rarely less than thrilling to watch. It’s a challenging, ambitious and genuinely original film packed with compelling performances – Washington and Debicki are especially excellent – which confirms Nolan as the master of the cerebral blockbuster. And if you can, you need to see this visually stunning movie on a big screen.

-[Nick Levine, NME](https://www.nme.com/reviews/tenet-review-christopher-nolan-2734576): 5/5

> The result is that as impressive as the craftsmanship and originality of Tenet is, other aspects of the movie prove to be frustrating. It's still a great movie and a true big-screen experience, but it does stop it reaching the heights of Nolan's best work.

-[Ian Sandwell, Digital Spy](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a33634131/tenet-review-christopher-nolan/): 4/5

> Seek it out, if only to marvel at the entertainingly inane glory of what we once had and are in danger of never having again. Well, that and the suits.

-[Jessica Kiang, The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/movies/tenet-review-christopher-nolan.html)

> All in all, Tenet delivers a mix of outstanding performances and unforgettable inverted sequences in another masterpiece of film making that will leave you on the edge of your seat.

-[Nola Ojomu, METRO](https://metro.co.uk/2020/08/21/tenet-review-john-david-washington-robert-pattinson-shine-christopher-nolan-tinkers-time-13159135/): 4/5

> Nolan devotees will still get a kick out of Tenet’s cerebral ideas and no doubt forgive its overloaded climax, while the more casual cinemagoer will get plenty of bang for their buck amid its vast visuals (cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema drenches the Nordic location in cool slate greys, while one clifftop shot of the Amalfi Coast is utterly beguiling). And after five months stuck in front of the small screen, maybe being a little overwhelmed is no bad thing. But it’s hard to escape the sense that less might have been more.

-[Phil De Semlyen, Time Out](https://www.timeout.com/movies/tenet-review-christopher-nolan-john-david-washington-sci-fi): 3/5

> I can’t even explain it. You literally just have to watch it. It’s very fire.
