Clear Coat vs Epoxy,Apprehensive-Run4147,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17w4t5z,0,0,"I plan to take a painted board, with some stickers on it that are about 1/16” thick, and seal it with a clear finish (will probably need to be 1/4” thick to get up over the stickers)

Has anyone used Rustoleum Clear Gloss?  Can it be poured that thick (like an epoxy) and still be clear and smooth?

Or do I need to pour a two part epoxy (significantly more expensive) to achieve the desired result? 

We are mimicking a tailgate game we played the other week. Their stickers were thinner."
