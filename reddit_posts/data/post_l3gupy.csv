How does space research benefit us?,xneera,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/l3gupy/how_does_space_research_benefit_us/,27,2,"For some time now I've been listening to a lot of people complaining and alleging (especially during this pandemic) that governments should not keep investing money and budgets on astronomy/space and celestial objects research and they ought to use it for more ""useful"" researches, for example sanity, and things that would give society a ""supposed immediate benefit"" as if astronomy is not giving right now any direct application (it pisses me off). So now I ask all of you, astronomy connoisseurs, the reasons why astronomy is SO important to us and what would you tell to all those people to make them change their mind, what benefits are we getting from investigation and all the pros (and refutable cons) of investing money in it and so they don't rule it out."
