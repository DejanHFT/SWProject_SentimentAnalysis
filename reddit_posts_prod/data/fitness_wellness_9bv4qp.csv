Most people assume that health is based on physical exercise and avoidance of diseases. However, there are a lot of aspects that come along when it comes to holistic well-being. The word holistic is used to define a collection of issues that need to be considered. The following are seven essential aspects of [Palm Beach holistic wellness](www.mytotalbodywellness.com/) that should be noted.
   
   
 Maintain social well-being. Social wellness is determined by the kind of relationship that one establishes with others. A big percentage of the world population is occupied in work routines, watching television, and their smart phones as well. Such this has led to a loss of social connection among workers, friends, and relatives. Therefore, one should adopt social activities such as family dinners, social events, playing with friends and arranging events in workplaces.
   
   
 Emotional health. Emotional wellness is characterized by having an accurate understanding of your feelings, thoughts, and behaviors even though they are good or not. It means that you should be able to cope with your emotions accordingly. Some of the measures that one can adapt to cope with them include maintaining positive attitude, accepting mistakes and trying to learn from them. One should as well seek support from reliable people when needed.
   
   
 Take note of your physical well-being. Your physical well-being is determined by your exercise, habits, and nutrition. Engage in regular exercises, but you should limit yourself according to your physical ability. You must also take balanced meals, reduce the intake of processed foods and reduce sugar intake as well. Finally, have regular medical checkups and avoid drug abuse or life-threatening activities.
   
   
 Take note of your environmental well-being. The environment is also an essential dimension in maintaining holistic wellness. Therefore, evaluate your lifestyle to identify aspects that affect the environment and conclude on relevant conservation measures. You can adopt conservation measures such as avoiding wastage of natural resources, conserving energy, embracing renewable energy sources and recycling. You should also spend enough time outdoors to enjoy the natural surroundings.
   
   
 Occupation health. Professional wellness involves the suitability of a workplace to provide an opportunity to express talents, skills, values and personal career goals. It also includes life roles such as fatherhood, motherhood, volunteer work, and hobbies. Occupation health can be maintained by establishing achievable goals, remaining optimistic even during failure and focusing on something that you like.
   
   
 Consider your intellectual well-being. This involves remaining open to new ideas and experiences that include various activities. Most people who maintain good intellectual health have fewer chances of incurring mental impairment as they grow old. Adopt multiple activities such as reading, traveling, engaging in solving problems, and active listening to enhance your intellectual well-being.
   
   
 Consider your spiritual well-being. Various factors define spiritual well-being. This includes values, religious faith, morals, and ethics. Your choice is based on your comfort and affiliation. You can improve your spiritual health by engaging in prayers, yoga, meditation, and reflection.
