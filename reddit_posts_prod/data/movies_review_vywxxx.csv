As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** 

>	The Gray Man is a spiritual throwback to 80s/90s action movies, with pulse-pounding fight scenes, delightfully cheesy dialogue & wickedly fun villain.

-[Molly Freeman, Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/the-gray-man-2022-movie-reviews/)

>	Everywhere looks so slick and empty that it’s impossible to differentiate any scene from your standard luxury hotel ad.

-[Clarisse Loughrey, The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-gray-man-review-netflix-b2122984.html)

>	Netflix delivers with The Gray Man, a rip-roaring and star-powered spy romp that puts all the money on screen as Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans go head to head.

-[Richard Trenholm, CNET](https://www.cnet.com/culture/entertainment/the-gray-man-review-netflixs-best-action-movie-yet/)

>	While the movie itself may prove nearly as unmemorable as its hero ostensibly wants to be, it’s anything but inconspicuous.

-[John DeFore,, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/ryan-gosling-chris-evans-netflixs-the-gray-man-1235179054/)

>	Two solid hours of efficient Netflix content is what’s on offer here, the action-thriller equivalent of a conscientiously microwaved Tuscan Sausage Penne from M&S. Read full review

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/14/the-gray-man-review-ryan-gosling-goes-rogue-in-gonzo-action-thriller/)

>	What makes The Gray Man exciting — and let’s not beat around the bush: This is the most exciting original action property Netflix has delivered since “Bright” — are the shades the ensemble bring to their characters and the little ways in which the Russos come through where those other films fell short.
