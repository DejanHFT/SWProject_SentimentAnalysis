How do I match the wall's existing texture after it gets patched?,laffytaffykidd,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/180sh39/how_do_i_match_the_walls_existing_texture_after/,5,2,"My wall currently - [https://postimg.cc/nC5SJw9R](https://postimg.cc/nC5SJw9R)

I had a contractor come by to create an outlet for me, and after he patched up the wall, he simply told me to ""sand the wall and paint it"".

I followed his instructions but I cannot get the texture to match exactly. I've simply been using a hand-sized paint roller.

Any techniques or tools that can help me achieve the ""current texture""?"
