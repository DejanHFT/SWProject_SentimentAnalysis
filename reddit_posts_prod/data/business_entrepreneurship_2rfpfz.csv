"Have a bachelors in Psych and want a fundamental knowledge in business entrepreneurship, is it a bad idea to go for bachelors?",hhollowed235,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/2rfpfz/have_a_bachelors_in_psych_and_want_a_fundamental/,1,1,"I graduated with my BA in Psych and am looking more toward a path where I can start my own business.  I don't have a great understanding of business principles but the field has always interested me and I've always been good with numbers and I have a pretty good networking vibe, meaning I enjoy talking to people.  Is going back for a bachelors a good idea or is it more wise to go for a masters, shoot, is it even a financially good idea to go back to school with all the free online resources available?  I just figured being in the atmosphere and being able to talk with real business professionals about their craft would be beneficial to my learning. Thank you and any feedback would be more than helpful."
