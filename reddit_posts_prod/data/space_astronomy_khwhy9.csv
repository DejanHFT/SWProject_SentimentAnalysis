Sidewalk astronomy for the Jupiter / Saturn conjunction,NoCleverNickname,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/khwhy9/sidewalk_astronomy_for_the_jupiter_saturn/,17,120,"Well, that was fun. Took my big telescope out to Lake Arlington to get good view of the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction.

I was able to spot Jupiter, three of its moons, and Saturn with its rings all in one field of view simultaneously.

There were a few people with binoculars, but I was the only one packing a 10 inch light bucket.

Had a number of onlookers, a lot of them kids who got to see an up close view of the conjunction. Everyone who came by also got a look at the moon, which is always much more “wow!” inducing anyway.

The littlest one, a girl about five or so was by far my best and most enthusiastic guest observer. She asked why the moon had so many craters. I explained because it’s constantly bombarded by meteors. Then she actually asked a FOLLOW UP QUESTION. “How do meteors form?”

I answered, but not before letting her know that was a GREAT question and how happy I was that she asked.
I’ve gotta do more of this sometime. 

Addendum: This bit of astro evangelizing was socially distant. Masks required, I’d point the telescope and take a few steps back so they could see."
