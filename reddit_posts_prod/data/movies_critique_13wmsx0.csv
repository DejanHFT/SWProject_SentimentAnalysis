What are your thoughts on the opinion that movies were better in the past than they are now?,Feeling_Painter_8332,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/13wmsx0/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_opinion_that_movies/,52,0,"As the title describes, this question is a reaction to a sentiment I've seen that X was better than it was now. Although a lot of this can be boiled down to people who are overly nostalgic of the past who have entered their ""back in my day"" phase, but I do believe there's genuinely interesting discussion to be had and critiques about the movies of today versus the past. I think it's a valuable question that can lead to fruitful discussion.

Particularly interested in people who do agree with the sentiment that movies were better in the past and for whatever reason are worse now."
