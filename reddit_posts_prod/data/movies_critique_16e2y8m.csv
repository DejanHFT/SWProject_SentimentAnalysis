Why are professional critiques adamant about including studio profit in their reviews?,Neither_Abalone2611,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16e2y8m/why_are_professional_critiques_adamant_about/,12,0,"I was reading a few reviews of films which led me down a wormhole of reading reviews of movies throughout the years. It seemed like a fair amount of reviews spent paragraphs explaining how a quarter of a billion or half a billion dollar movie was a flop because of the studio cost. This information is completely relevant to the filmmaker, but to the consumer, i'd argue it's irrelevant. I doubt anyone has pity for Disney when one of their films grosses below their expectations. 

From the consumer standpoint, I just don't see the fun, or value in caring or reading about whether a major film studio made money on a film. 

I'd love to hear other opinions on this."
