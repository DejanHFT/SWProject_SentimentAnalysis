How do you get your creative ideas?,-Sparkwoodand21-,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/1hmmt7/how_do_you_get_your_creative_ideas/,24,2,"No, really. Not: where do you get them from? *How* do you go about getting your ideas?

I'm interested in creative techniques, idea generation, inspiration, and suchlike and am always on the look out of new ways of creating ideas. 

I wrote a [blog post](http://duncanmckean.com/how-to-generate-ideas/) on the way that I generate ideas and was wondering how different it was to other people's techniques for generating ideas.

If you feel comfortable telling me, please do. Thanks."
