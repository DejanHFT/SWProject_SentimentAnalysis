Motivation motivation...,MsCarrot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1b1krz/motivation_motivation/,5,0,"I hope this quetion isn't to weird, or that I post it in the wrong subreddit ... or that I won't make any sense. But I have been thinking about this for months now and I need help understanding myself. Or maybe I do not even have to understand myself rather more to just bring myself to follow through things I want to do.

Every night after work, chores and well life in general I find myself browsing (often for HOURS) blogs, articles and information relating to training, healthy diets, how the body works, running, yoga, cooking from scratch, how to stop eating bad, get rid of cravings etc. When I am reading these stuff I truly (and I mean TRULY!) feel motivated. I want to be a person who has a real interest for health and cooking, who takes care of oneself and who is aware of her body and mind.

Despite this I am not that person. I am the average girl who goes to the gym twice a week at its best, buys tons of lean meat and veggies at the supermarket but grabs cheese and bread instead once home. I collect healthy recepies but never cook them. I make exercise programs but quit after smallest set-back. I never ever really follow anything that I plan though. Ever. 

Why can I not find the strenght to change my habits? To become the person I want to be so badly? I know it probably sounds like a lie, but my motivation is true - as sure as I have been on anything I know that I want to be that person.

I have no real hobbies or friends in this city I now live in. I have not only the will but also the time and money to invest in this lifestyle and yet I do not do it. I pick candy and TV... every day.

Any help is appreciated."
