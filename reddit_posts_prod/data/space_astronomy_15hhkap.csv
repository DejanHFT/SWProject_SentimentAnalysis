Looking for recommendations on Astronomy/Astrophysics books for beginners,GreatJacket,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/15hhkap/looking_for_recommendations_on/,28,30,"Hi, I'm a Electrical Engineering student looking to learn more about astronomy and astrophysics. I donÂ´t have a deep background in astronomy right now, just the basic stuff you learn about physics and math in the first years of university yet I'm fascinated with the content and want to understand more about theories and properties of the universe. Could someone recommend me some interesting books to introduce myself in astronomy?"
