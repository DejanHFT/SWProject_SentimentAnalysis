Why is lithium-ion technology preferred for grid energy storage?,vonBeche,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6giedu/why_is_lithiumion_technology_preferred_for_grid/,6,4,"It [seems](http://www.energystorageexchange.org/projects?utf8=%E2%9C%93&technology_type_sort_eqs=Electro-chemical&technology_type_sort_eqs_category=Electro-chemical&technology_type_sort_eqs_subcategory=&country_sort_eq=&state_sort_eq=&kW=&kWh=&service_use_case_inf=&ownership_model_eq=&status_eq=&siting_eq=&order_by=size_kw&sort_order=desc&search_page=1&size_kw_ll=&size_kw_ul=&size_kwh_ll=&size_kwh_ul=&show_unapproved=%7B%7D) that many new electricity storage plans are based on lithium-ion-type chemistry. As far as I know, Li-Ion batteries are preferred for many applications because they have a high energy density, a low self-discharge rate and no memory effects. These benefits seem useless if you're just placing the battery somewhere and charging & de-charging it every day.  

On the other hand Li-Ion batteries age faster and are supposed to be more expensive than other types. A back of the envelope calculation (6$/kg lithium carbonate, $2/kg Mn ~ 5$/kg LiMnO3 ~ 20$/kWh spent on raw materials (assuming [250 Wh/kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery)) battery) tells me that quite a bit of the 125$/kWh of the Chevy [Bolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery#Market) is spent on raw materials. Specifically [NaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium%E2%80%93sulfur_battery) chemistry seems like it has the potential to be much cheaper.  Are there no benefits to large-scale professionally maintained lead-acid systems? Can't we build something based on a couple of cheaper elements? Especially when batteries with 1/10th the energy density would work just fine?"
