I [28 F] can't support my husband [40 M] while he's making awful decisions,saneamongcrazies,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7n3hei/i_28_f_cant_support_my_husband_40_m_while_hes/,163,730,"My husband [40M] and I [28F] have been together for five years, married for almost two. 

To make a very long story short, four years ago my husband turned to self-employment after losing two good jobs - one he was laid off of to no fault of his own, and one he was fired from due to the inability to work well with others. To pay the bills, he began purchasing items at auction and re-selling them online, buying more expensive items and larger lots as his operation grew. This spiraled out of control, as he started making bigger and bigger investments that just weren't paying off. His storage space grew from a 10x10 unit to a 1000 sf+ warehouse, the majority of the product collecting dust for months because he apparently doesn't have time to list everything. Really, he overwhelmed himself with too much stuff to effectively sell, yet he kept buying more. There have been periods where he was making quite a bit of money, but the majority of the time has been just enough to keep afloat.

This spring, he confessed to me that his sales have consistently dropped off to the point where he's going to have to dip into our small, but decent savings just to pay the rent next month. This happened around the same time that our lease was up, so after much discussion we decided to move to my family's property out in the middle of nowhere so that we could save up money. Our goal is to move cross-country to a much cheaper state, so eliminating rent would expedite that. So I gave up my job that I adored, got a remote position within the same corporation, and we moved this summer. 

It's been incredibly hard considering the house is old and in serious need of renovation. We had to spend a good portion of our savings just making it livable, yet two of the most important things have not happened yet because my husband is just too busy. He has not installed a fence, despite having three small dogs and often seeing coyotes and loose dogs wander onto the property. He also has not installed out washer/dryer yet, but he seems content without this as he sends his laundry off for his mom to do. 

He's working 12-16 hour days, spending nearly every waking moment either on his computer/phone or out at his storage area on the property shipping/organizing/whatever else he does out there. He works at least half of the weekend selling at the swap meet, spending the other half doing nothing because he's so tired. I could accept this should he be making enough money to contribute back into savings, but he's not. He's averaging $5 per hour, which is just not acceptable - especially when minimum wage in our state is $10.50. He says he's looking for work, but that he never hears back after submitting applications. My opinion is that he's set his sights too high and is only applying for high-paying jobs that have much more experienced competition - he insists this isn't the case, but I find it hard to believe he can't find *anything* at a reasonable wage after years of looking.

Our bills are $1600/month less and he *still* has had to stop paying his student loan (he was ahead by 6 months, so no missed payments yet), he's only making the minimum payment on his $10k credit card debt, and hasn't even spent money on new stock in quite a while. There is no money going out, yet bills still aren't being paid. Just last night, he asked me to pay the electric bill because he doesn't have the money in any of his accounts combined. He comes to me with his worries of paying the bills, and his exasperation in not knowing how to fix any of this. None of my suggestions are apparently valid, so I tend to just shut my mouth and listen to him fret. He is absolutely floundering, and it makes my heart hurt to see him so desperate.

I want to support him. I want to be that wife that selflessly sets her life aside to support her husband getting back on his feet. But I just can't. I see all the mistakes he's making and continuing to make, and he won't listen to reason. We're living here because he spent $10k on a truck load that turned out to be absolute shit, and now he's talking about needing to spend $1k on another load that ""could turn things around."" When I tell him not to do it, I'm the bad guy because I apparently can't possibly understand. He makes chronically bad decisions, and I feel utterly helpless to change any of it because my opinion is usually only valid if it supports his. I feel like he's ruining our lives and all I can do it stand back and watch it all burn. I know he looks back on the good sale times, but I honestly believe those days are over. This is not sustainable, but he doesn't see that. He keeps sinking more and more money in, bailing out water instead of fixing the hole. 

I've been SO patient because I know he's working so hard... but I've reached a breaking point, and it's all I can do not to chew his ass out every chance I get. I've tried to be gentle in expressing my frustration without finger pointing, and he has apologized for putting us here, but it's **so** hard not to be resentful. I've already thrown away a job I loved, moved to the middle of nowhere (closest grocery store is 40 minutes away via windy mountain roads), I do ALL the housework, I cook or pay for us to eat out when I can't/don't want to cook, I take care of the dogs, etc. I am alone all the time; even if he's in the room, he hardly acknowledges a word I say or he makes it clear that I'm annoying him. There have been so many sacrifices made and it feels like it's all for nothing. 

How do I need to broach this situation? I have no idea how to support my husband, or if I even should. I don't know how I can do this, or what to do to make it any better. It's hard to tell which way is up anymore, and I feel lost in how to handle my life.

  **tl;dr**: I'm having a hard time being supportive of my husband, who (to me) appears to be making horrible decisions, placing us in less than ideal living conditions. "
