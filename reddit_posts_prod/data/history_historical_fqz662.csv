Are biblical events cited elsewhere in historical texts?,raresleeper,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/fqz662/are_biblical_events_cited_elsewhere_in_historical/,225,119,"In the bible it claims that once Jesus died, there was a massive earthquake, so large that the temple split into two. Surely an earthquake of that scale was recorded by someone else. Other examples are the flood from Noahâ€™s ark, the Israelites leaving Egypt with Moses, etc. These are all huge events that I would like to think there were others who recorded these things"
