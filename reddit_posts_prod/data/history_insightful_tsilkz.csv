Why did Kings Need Money?,BJPark,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/tsilkz/why_did_kings_need_money/,38,6,"We hear about kings always being in debt, needing to borrow money for expensive lifestyles or to wage war.

But why did they need money in the first place? As king, you can just tell people what to do, or heads roll! ""Build me this palace, peasants"" or ""Grow this food for me, peasants"", or ""Go fight for me, you guys, and you guys"".

What's the point of being king if you have to pay people?? Then you're just like everyone else. How are you special?"
