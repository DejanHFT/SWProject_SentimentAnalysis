Bike/walk trip companies similar to The Natural Adventure or Mac's Adventure?,sopsign7,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/11nrucs/bikewalk_trip_companies_similar_to_the_natural/,0,2,"Projecting into the future, I'm probably going to have some extra time every year for solo travels - my wife takes a trip every year with her family, so I'll have extra days left over for solo travels. This works out because I'm more interested than her in active travels like hiking, and I've been looking at getting into cycling as well.

I came across The Natural Adventure and Mac's Adventure and like their business style. Solo travel is possible over varying lengths of time. It's also possible to get it stripped down so you're getting a room and a rented bike for a week and almost nothing more, so there's a lot of independence possible at a low price point. A lot of the trips I'm seeing with those two companies are less than $1000 USD, which I'd consider a sweet spot financially.

I like the look of both of those companies and I'm interested in some tips about other, similar companies that have offerings around that same price point. Additionally or alternatively, any tips on renting a bike in one location and returning in another - are there any regional, national, or international bike carriers that operate similarly to a rental car company where you could pick up in one city and return in another at the end of your trip (say, pick up in Bordeaux, return in Toulouse). I'd like to be able to cover more ground on a bike, but don't want to circle back to the origin point to drop off a bike.

Currently 41 and in good physical condition. Coming from America, prefer destinations in Europe. Thanks in advance for the advice, all!"
