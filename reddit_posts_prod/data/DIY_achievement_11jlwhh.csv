Replacing wooden window trim,fruntside,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/11jlwhh/replacing_wooden_window_trim/,3,10,"Hello DIYers,

I'm hoping for some advice in the best way to go about replacing the wooden trim surrounding some glass panels in a wooden door.

The existing trim is perishing and needs to be removed and replaced. I'm fairly confident I can find new trim to match and have the tools to cut to the right sizes. I'm hoping I can achieve this without removing the glass.

I'm assuming I'll need to clean and prime the existing surface and also prime the new trim before installing, but what I'm not sure how to do is ensuring is the seal is waterproof. 

Any advice is very much appreciated!

Thanks in advance!"
