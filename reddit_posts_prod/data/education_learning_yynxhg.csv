"You can't learn a concept deeply when you're neither interested in it, nor see a need for learning it.",boman0003,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/yynxhg/you_cant_learn_a_concept_deeply_when_youre/,42,60,"This is the biggest blunder of the current educational system. 

When a students asks the very common question of ""why am i learning this?"" they are usually answered by the likes of ""so you can keep your options open"", or ""to make you into a well rounded adult"". 

But if a student is neither interested in, nor sees a need for being in any given course, they are only ever going to do the bare minimum to pass that course, so they can forget about it as soon as possible. No deep knowledge of anything is acquired, and everybody's time is wasted.

We need to give students more autonomy over their own studies, let them chart their own path, so they can actually grow, discover their passions, and spend their time & energy meaningfully.

Things need to change."
