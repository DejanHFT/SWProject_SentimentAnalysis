Experiences with g adventures in Namibia/South Africa/Botsuana?,AlanaYoung1,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/11bo577/experiences_with_g_adventures_in_namibiasouth/,7,1,"Hi everyone!
My fiance and I were looking into honeymoon destinations. It is quite a rare occasion that he gets three weeks off work so we want to make the most of it and want to see more than one country in Africa. We discovered that most ""typical"" honeymoon offers don't exceed two weeks or are insanely expensive if they do, so we're looking into group trips.
I've travelled with g adventures before and I had one great experience (Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam) and one mediocre experience in Morocco  (while there was a lot of driving involved in both trips, it was more straining in Morocco because it felt like there were so many unnecessary stops  where they tried to sell stuff to us, which made us miss out on other experiences). I feel like it's a bit hit and miss. Has anyone ever done a g adventures tour in those countries and can share their experiences? 
We were thinking about doing the 18 day Cape town to Victoria falls tour (with a few extra days alon in cape Town for the honeymoon vibe)"
