The passport mystery - or where should I actually put it while exploring?,Notyourkindofgurl,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18xbckg/the_passport_mystery_or_where_should_i_actually/,21,0,"I took a UN-related safety course during international travel and they were adamant about leaving your passport inside those safe boxes at hotels.

However, while backpacking I don't usually stay in hotels and I'd be hesitant to leave my passport in a hostel locker. However, they did have some good points regarding not bringing your passport during a tour or while sightseeing.

What would you recommend??"
