I lose motivation to work out after work..,brentafer,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3w9iap/i_lose_motivation_to_work_out_after_work/,28,2,"so i work ten to twelve hours days. i am super motivated at work, and its a pretty physical job. i cant wait to get home and ride my bike trainer or do some kettle bell routines.. problem is by,the time i get home its dark out, and ive lost the motiation. i end up eating dinner and going to bed relatively early. i really do want to see some progress, but the energy isnt there. how do you busy bee's keep the motivation, and have the time to do some workout worth your time?"
