Where does your writing inspiration come from?,rhobhfan00,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/xrks5r/where_does_your_writing_inspiration_come_from/,60,21,"What inspires you to write? Do you have a muse? I find my inspiration pops up in the most random places. I can be driving down a road and start formulating stories for the people who live in the houses that I pass. It never really shuts off, but I wouldnt have it any other way."
