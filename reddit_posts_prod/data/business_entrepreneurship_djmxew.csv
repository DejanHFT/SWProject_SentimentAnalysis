Is Renaissance Technologies the company positioned in the sweetest spot in the entire world? Perhaps in the history of business and entrepreneurship,AjaxFC1900,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/djmxew/is_renaissance_technologies_the_company/,5,1,"In my opinion there is a strong claim that in fact it is:

1) Highly automated business . Basically everything is taken care by computers except for the modeling .

2) Requires approximately 100 people to do the (extremely) deep level thinking and modeling while the rest is done by computers

3) Managed to get through the regulatory apocalypse of 07-08 and came out stronger. Compared to that what big tech is going through now is peanuts.

4) Most importantly nobody knows what the heck is happening within Renaissance . IP is secured by NDAs and reputation in the scientific community opposed to patents which can easily be reverse engineered or not respected at all (looking at you China). 

5) On top of that corporate strategies cannot be copied or reverse engineered either (think when a new functionality is implemented on Facebook for example...that is transparent and twitter can easily copycat that. Same thing is true for every other industry. Renaissance competitors instead know that they made money but don’t know the how....also unlike any other private company this is not even visible in the real world as they don’t have factories, warehouses etc."
