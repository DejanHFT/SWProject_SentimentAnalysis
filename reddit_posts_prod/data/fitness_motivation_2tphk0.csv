First things first, I'm a 20 yr old female who needs some help shrinking size. I started gaining weight about 2 years ago originally from a birth control gone wrong/getting sober from opiates. Over the past two years I've gone from a size 2, to size 14.

I was down to a size 9 this summer, and was on the right track by eating super healthy and going on vigorous hikes every weekend. In November, my best friend passed away and I didn't leave my bed for 2 weeks straight. I ate tubs of ice cream daily, and gave up entirely on my body (and mental health). 

What I'm asking of you, /r/fitness, is if anyone can give me somewhat of a push in the right direction. Maybe a friend on here that I can message back and forth to keep me from falling right back into my depression binge eating. I know it's a lot to ask, but I know I have a problem that will just get worse and worse if I don't try to stop it. 

If anyone has advice as well, it's much needed! 

Thank you, all! "
