Motivation and what drives you guys,MattThePunc4ke,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3letgf/motivation_and_what_drives_you_guys/,79,14,How do you guys motivate yourselves to go exercise? I'm finding it hard just to be motivated..most of the times for me it's cuz I just don't want to be lazy and stay at home but I'll leave it for you to guess what happens :/
