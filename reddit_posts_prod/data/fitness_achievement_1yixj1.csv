Achieving a full split,rako,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1yixj1/achieving_a_full_split/,27,11,"In addition to my normal strength training(Powerlifting) I want to gain more flexibilty. My main goal is to do a full split (with ease).


I stretch at least every 2nd day. I'm progressing pretty well overall, but I stalled on my way to do a full split. I can split my legs so they are only in a 90° angle. Which seems to be really bad, considering I want to reach 180°. 
To this point I only did static stretching. This worked really well for my shoulders, but it seems like my hips/legs aren't responding in the same way.


I need some stretches/tips on how to progress towards my goal. Can anyone share a story of success?
