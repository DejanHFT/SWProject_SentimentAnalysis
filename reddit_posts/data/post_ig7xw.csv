Can anyone identify this organism for me?,secretlyMIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ig7xw/can_anyone_identify_this_organism_for_me/,2,3,"Here's a [pic](http://i.imgur.com/5BgAi.jpg) of the life form in question. You can see what looks like a hollow stalk sticking out of the ground in the bottom left, and on the right is the portion that had broken off from it. From my limited knowledge, I'm guessing that it's some type of fungus, but I'd like to know more. (As for location, this picture was taken in Iowa, under a tree.)"
