Heads up: Adobe Creative Cloud pricing is negotiable. You can even get 60 days free just by clicking cancel.,Gutenbergbible,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/brptyh/heads_up_adobe_creative_cloud_pricing_is/,85,658,"You basically never should be paying the pricing listed on the Adobe website for Creative Cloud.

I’ve been a CC user since they launched and have literally never paid full price.

The best thing you can do for a personal account is call and say you’re canceling, but the live chat works really well too. If you hate talking to strangers or have no free time, just going through the cancellation process online will automatically offer you ~60 free days to stay. 

They also have good pricing for students and they’re pretty lax about that. If you’ve got any claim to student-hood, they’ll take it. 

If you’re paying Business/Team Pricing, this is even more true. It normally requires extra negotiation, but you can save your org thousands of dollars with some back and forth. You don’t have to be huge. I negotiate with them professionally and they’re honestly one of the easier companies to deal with. Happy to give tips to anyone specifically.


*Edit: Since I offered it to the couple of people who DMed me, I'll just post it. If you have business pricing with adobe, DM me and I'll do a discounted rate to negotiate it for you.*"
