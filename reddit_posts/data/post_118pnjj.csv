What makes bats a good disease vector?,JustJustinInTime,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/118pnjj/what_makes_bats_a_good_disease_vector/,80,419,"I was reading about how bats can carry a lot of diseases that are transferrable to humans and it made me wonder why. I was curious in general what features made a species a good disease vector relative to another species, especially when thinking of non-pest animals, e.g. armadillos with Leprosy, as opposed to animals like fleas that were able to transfer the Bubonic Plague because they were on rats that were near humans.
Thanks!"
