Spent 2 weeks exploring Bali with my camera,off-season-explorer,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/191vch1,10,191,Was based out of Uluwatu and visited a lot of beaches and temples in the area. Did a few longer trips out to Nusa Penida and waterfalls around Ubud. It was a lot slower paced than my usual vacations (traveled with family) so I got a chance to get to know the area better. Specific locations are described in the comments.
