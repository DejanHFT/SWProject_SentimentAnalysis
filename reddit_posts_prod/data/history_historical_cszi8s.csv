Are there any historical instances where food went out of style?,giraffeman3705,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/cszi8s/are_there_any_historical_instances_where_food/,221,51,"I wonder because we know with clothing that every x amount of years or so fashion changes, but I don't think I've ever really thought of any food and went ""wow, that food is so old-fashioned""... so I was wondering if that has ever happened, or there are instances of foods that we don't eat now but were popular many years ago?"
