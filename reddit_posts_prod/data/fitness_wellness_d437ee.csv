Are you supposed to feel well rested with regular gym workout?,ChristianTheOne,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/d437ee/are_you_supposed_to_feel_well_rested_with_regular/,43,60,"I hit the gym first time some years ago when I was in highschool and since then the only period I wasn't training(like 1.5 out of the last 5 years) I was feeling pretty lethargic all the time.

So I starting going to gym again, but then there is the issue, how I am supposed to feel good physically if I spend my rest period recovering.

Today it's my workout, after that I feel tired, tommorow I am a bit sore during the resting day.
Then the workout day comes again.

So out of 2 days in-between workouts, 1.5 days I spend feeling tired and recovering, the other 0.5 I am pretty well rested and it feels good.

I made improvements to the quality of what I eat, my sleeping schedule.

So it begs the question, yes, I improve physically by hitting the gym, but does it improve my quality of life if I am in recovery all the time, feeling my muscles sore?"
