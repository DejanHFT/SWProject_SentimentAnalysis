I dropped out of high school and skipped 10th-12th grade with a GED. Now I’m 17 and I do pressure washing and Amazon FBA. But I have a major problem.,TimsNext,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/14cr304/i_dropped_out_of_high_school_and_skipped_10th12th/,2,2,"My motivation has been dwindling since leaving school because of social isolation - I have no friends that share my interest in entrepreneurship.   
Can you imagine trying to learn any other skill without a community? We have classrooms in school, we have teams in sports, but in business... you’re on your own. Why?  
If you are interested in E-commerce, or know someone who is (kids, cousins, friends etc), PLEASE send me a personal message.   
I know you guys are very rare. But I know you’re out there somewhere."
