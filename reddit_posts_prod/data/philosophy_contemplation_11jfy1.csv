So regarding the simultaneous weight and weightlessness of existence...,Nickyfyrre,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/11jfy1/so_regarding_the_simultaneous_weight_and/,14,12,"Hello, I would like to pose this question to my fellow redditors regarding the very nature of choice. If our life is finite, then an appropriate conclusion is that every choice we have ever and ever will make in our ONE life (of 50-75 years) will have been of no consequence to the eventual Heat Death of the Universe at billions of years from now..

Furthermore, the opposite inquiry that derives from this is if our lives are infinite (I would like to exclude religious views on this, i.e. Heaven/Hell), meaning consciously connected multiple lives or a direct continuation of this one, does this not also render every single choice we have ever and ever will make utterly pointless in the face of blistering infinity?

So where does real meaning arise in this dichotomy?

I would posit that ""real"" meaning does not exist, using the unfathomable weight (or weightlessness) of our existence as my argument. Can anyone really say that meaning exists *in a void* (or *in a ""fullness""*)?

I speak in the sense of ""life"" meaning this Universe, essentially, since that is what is most at stake. Reincarnation would be an example of infinite existence of self, but only if one knew one had been reincarnated each time.

This is what Milan Kundera described in his novel *The Unbearable Lightness of Being*, in which he used the microcosm of a relationship stressed by simultaneous love and hatred to demonstrate the simultaneous weight and weightlessness of existence, which brings me to my next question...

What does this imply about morality and fidelity?

If death is an ultimate end, should I even consider my significant other as an important being? If existence is infinite, then does that not imply that consequence is irrelevant? Thus, is cheating or a general hedonistic approach to one's life unhindered by morality? Is murder simply an *action*, rendered inconsequential by the inevitable weightlessness (or weight) of our lives? The ""human responsibility without God"" argument, proposed by Simone de Beauvoir, is rubbish here, as it falls away when one contemplates time on such a grand scale (or insignificantly short scale). 

Hedonism is most likely easier to argue here than the notion that murder is inconsequential, since it's simpler to say something like, ""I am simply living how I feel I want to within the infinite or finite constraints to which I am chained. Thus I do heroin. It all has no meaning in the first place."", rather than, ""I want to kill my brother because he ate the last pancake. It's all meaningless anyway."" I believe this illuminates the ridiculousness of a number of taboos inherent in our culture, although perhaps not murder, since an intrinsic value of life argument could be made.

tl;dr I am wondering if any of you fellas and gals have some semblance of answer to the total lack of meaning that arises from both infinite and finite existences in the context of choice. Also morality. I'm certainly curious to see what redditors think! 

OR IS IT JUST ABSURD ANYWAY DON'T CARE YOLO CAMUS"
