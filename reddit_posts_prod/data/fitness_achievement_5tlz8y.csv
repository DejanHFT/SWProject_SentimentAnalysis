"Once I've achieved my fitness goals, what is needed for maintenance?",captnmiss,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5tlz8y/once_ive_achieved_my_fitness_goals_what_is_needed/,29,34,"This sub has been tremendous with helping me achieve awesome strides in my fitness and for that thank you! I did a cursory search for maintenance advice but I couldn't find anything, so apologies if this has been answered before. 

For example, if I went to the gym 3-4 times a week to gain my muscles originally, how many times would I minimally need to go now to maintain them? I assume less work is needed since I'm not building further. "
