Patagonia- Adventure Trip,SnooSquirrels256,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/v4sfog/patagonia_adventure_trip/,1,2,"I am 27 years old and my partner is 25 years old. We live in the U.S. and are wanting to travel to Patagonia for a trekking adventure. We’re not climbers or mountaineers but we’ve backpacked all over the U.S and hiked some peaks in Colorado, USA. Is there anyone who has traveled to Patagonia that could recommend a basic itinerary or a guided adventure company you’d recommend using that is safe and reliable?"
