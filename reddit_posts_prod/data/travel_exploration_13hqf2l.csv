Mendoza to Salta Travel and Exploration Without a Car?,lazytealeaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/13hqf2l/mendoza_to_salta_travel_and_exploration_without_a/,0,3,"Hello. I'm planning to travel from Mendoza to Salta and I know there's lots of things to see along the way and most people would hire a car, or have their own, to be able to see everything over a week or so. Does anyone know if it's possible, and how easy it is, to explore this route using busses? Obviously I know there are busses between the two cities but I imagine most of them don't stop everywhere or go to the more interesting places. I'd really like to stop at Talampaya and Ischigualto park for example, but this seems impossible without a car or paying for an expensive tour from San Juan or La Rioja or something like that. Hiring a car for multiple days is pretty expensive as I'm solo but I guess one option could be to go to a bigger town nearby and hire for one day for example.

Just looking for general advice or shared experiences, especially from anyone who has done anything similar. Thanks!"
