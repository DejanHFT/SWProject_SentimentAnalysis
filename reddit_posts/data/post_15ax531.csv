is a solar wind powered wind turbine possible?,somedudealone,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/15ax531/is_a_solar_wind_powered_wind_turbine_possible/,22,44,"solar wind can exert a force on object and have been used as a mean of propulsion for spacecraft. For example, the IKAROS experimental spacecraft by JAXA. If so, can it be use as a way to generate energy like wind turbine on earth for spacecraft?

And assume it worked, how much energy can it create and what kind of design will be the best for optimal power output? "
