How do I stay motivated to keep learning?,Lower_Blood_1509,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/pst1m1/how_do_i_stay_motivated_to_keep_learning/,22,20,"It just dawned on me this year how behind I have fallen. I don't remember much from school (not even sex ed) and I really want to apply myself and learn while in this graduate program but it feels impossible. I feel like I stopped applying myself in middle school. I am 26 years old and I want to study, I want to be able to engage with people, I want to finish a book and read at a decent pace, I want to keep up with conversations, I want to remember things that I've learned but sometimes it feels too impossible (but I know it isn't)."
