How do I get a well defined lower ab line?,Liming_here,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/su1kc/how_do_i_get_a_well_defined_lower_ab_line/,80,50,"Hey guys, i have a question.  You know that some people (models, actors) have REALLY developed lower ab/pelvic line.   

(like these muscles. http://www.sports-injury-info.com/image-files/finding-the-lower-abs.jpg  and this http://abdominal-exercises-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Abdominal-exercises.jpg) 

Is there a way to train that part? I know that the best way to show abs is to do  appropriate workout + cardio + diet right, but i just want to know if there's a better way to emphasize on that region? Thank you."
