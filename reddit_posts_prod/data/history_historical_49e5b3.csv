"Looking for a book on the most important historical developments (ie germs, gunpowder, steel, the longbow, the phalanx, sewers etc)",Arasin89,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/49e5b3/looking_for_a_book_on_the_most_important/,290,549,"Hi everyone, I'm looking for a book or something of that nature that would detail the most important developments in politics, military strategy, science, economics, medicine etc, those that allowed civilization to move forward and develop in crucial ways for the future of the human project, any ideas? 
Also, if anyone wants to share their own thoughts on what some of the important development might be that would not be unwelcome. 
Thanks! "
