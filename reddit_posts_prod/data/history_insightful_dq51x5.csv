History text books from different countries.,RockyBarbacoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/dq51x5/history_text_books_from_different_countries/,101,182,"I work in a school and I’m becoming a history teacher. Going through the subjects (Texas History, US History ect) there are obviously biases, borderline propaganda throughout the text books. 

I’m really curious to read another perspective, learn about the colonial era through a British History book or WW2 from a Japanese history book. I’d really like them to be high school level text books through, does anyone have any input on this or know where I can get these books?

E: a lot of really good points being brought up and thanks for all the insight. If anyone can give me info on British History books used at the high school level (whatever it’s called in the UK) I’d like to order one online. Thanks!"
