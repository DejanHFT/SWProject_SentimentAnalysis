What got you motivated?,OsamaBinHiding,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/220uba/what_got_you_motivated/,48,13,"I'm really interested to see what got you all to start?
Like, what keeps you driven to do this week in, week out or what is the reason why you started to do it?

For me, I had always been the skinny guy at my school, good looking - but very skinny and it really played on my self esteem. I got very ill and got even skinnier. My weight was around 9st when I was 5'11 (Have no idea what that is in KG. It's around 178cm) So I started to gain weight again once I got healthy. I gained so much weight - 2/3 stone, that I started to get a bit 'fat' (Beer belly!). I didn't really care until someone I worked with told me I had a fat belly! Haven't looked back since.

Be honest! ;)"
