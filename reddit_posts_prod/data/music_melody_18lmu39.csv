"Help, I sampled the same melody as another artist, what should I do?",2proxus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/18lmu39/help_i_sampled_the_same_melody_as_another_artist/,1,0,"This is the other artists song:[https://open.spotify.com/track/7gSvcK1SGF4VMXVoE6VYNt?si=3fbb658a1b45421f](https://open.spotify.com/track/7gSvcK1SGF4VMXVoE6VYNt?si=3fbb658a1b45421f)

This is mine:[https://open.spotify.com/track/60VNxfYAVhVY2LHdouht9B?si=b0511f68064d421d](https://open.spotify.com/track/60VNxfYAVhVY2LHdouht9B?si=b0511f68064d421d) 

I'm worried that Spotify and perhaps the creator could write this off as plagiarism.

I got this melody from some random website which I forgot, I couldn't find any way to contact the artist. Help.....??"
