"Husband [M27] and I [F26] married for 2 years, he's in constant pursuit of his dream job. I support him and want him happy but also feel like he needs a stable job to support our growing family. He's frustrated, thinks I don't care if he's miserable.",HubbyWantsDreamJob,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8qkk1e/husband_m27_and_i_f26_married_for_2_years_hes_in/,252,490,"My husband has always had big dreams of making it rich off his own business, never having a boss, and living off ""residual income."" Before we got married, he was heavily involved in a variety of MLM schemes with the dream of making it big. Since we've gotten married, I had him stop his involvement in all MLM schemes, but I also supported him in starting his own business (a podcast that loses ~$250 each month). I'm fine putting a few hundred dollars into the podcast each month because I know he enjoys it and has dreams of it making money some day.

My husband currently has a job with GREAT pay for not having a college degree ($75k/year) and OK benefits, but he hates it - it's in an industry that he never wanted a career in (although he's been successful in the industry and working in it for the last 7 years). He is constantly coming up with new business ideas (some of the more recent ideas include getting a loan for $200k and ranching sheep; starting an Amazon business and buying stuff cheap from China to re-sell; starting an at-home daddy daycare; going to school and become a lawyer; etc.). As you can see from the examples, his business/career ideas are ALL OVER THE PLACE.

My husband's dream is making his own money in the outdoor industry. When brainstorming jobs, he has a few main priorities (not in any particular order): 

1) Being able to go on hunts whenever he wants.

2) Never missing a visitation with his son. He doesn't have primary custody, so he gets his son every other weekend during the school year, all summer, and then for various holidays throughout the year. He wants a job that allows him to spend essentially every day all summer with his son. We've had to get a babysitter for a total of 14 hours this summer and he hated it, said it made him feel like a terrible dad.

3) Not having a boss.

4) Residual income.

My priorities are a little different. I want him to be happy, but I also think there are certain times you need to suck it up and consider your RESPONSIBILITIES above your dreams. I want him to have steady work with a consistent paycheck. We are in a bunch of debt and slowly trying to pay it off. I want him to have good benefits. I am pregnant with our first child together and it's important that we have things like life insurance and health insurance set up for our family (I get this through my job, but I still feel more comfortable having it available through both of us just in case something were to happen to my job). 

My concerns are that every single job idea he brings up is entirely random. I am all for investing in his future to help him find a career that he wants and enjoys, but when he throws out such random ideas, it makes me feel like it would be stupid to invest in it because he's likely to get bored of it or not like it anymore after only a few months. I'm also not willing to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in a loan to start a business (like ranching sheep), when he can't even bring in income for his current business. I'd feel much better letting him start additional businesses if he could show that he is successful with the first one.

He feels like I'm not supportive of him being happy, and that I'm content to just let him ""be miserable"" in his work. I absolutely LOVE my job (I went to undergraduate and graduate school for this field, studied hard, and worked to get hired in my dream position). He thinks that because I'm happy, I either don't understand what it's like to be miserable in a job, or I just don't care.

I don't know how to address this issue with him. The other day he mentioned going to school to be a lawyer. I told him that in that career, he wouldn't be able to do all the hunts he wanted and would likely miss a lot of visitation time with his son (not like he could just tell his clients ""sorry, I actually can't make it to the deposition, I haven't filled my deer tag yet!""). He sees my response as immediately shutting down his hopes and dreams and wanting him to be miserable. I'm just trying to help him find a job that not only lets him do everything he wants to do and be happy, but also gives me the peace of mind that we will have consistent income to support our family.

How do I address the issue of helping him find a job he likes that fills both his and my priorities, and not making him think I want him to continue being miserable?

TLDR: Husband wants dream job. His dream job is literally a job you might only find in your dreams - very few people have jobs like this. I want him to have steady work to help support our growing family and pay off debt. He thinks I want him to be miserable."
