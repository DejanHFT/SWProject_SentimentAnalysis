What is the WORST Piece of Literary Criticism You Have Ever Read,SnoopCeviche,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/sr3qdq/what_is_the_worst_piece_of_literary_criticism_you/,51,10,"Lately I have been teaching a class on Romeo and Juliet and film adaptations of the play. I happened to come across a piece about Baz Luhrmann's \[excellent\] 1996 film, and almost died when my eyes rolled back into my head.   I have put the link below because it's not letting me embed it. 

In making an admittedly cogent point about postmodern film, the author states that one thing Luhrmann did was to make cinematic references to other films that Leo Dicaprio starred in as a part of his strategy of using ""intermediality."" Okay, fine. I get that. It's fun to play around and make little nudge nudge wink wink asides to the film world that the actors are starring in. Only, this author states that one of the references is to The Great Gatsby, which was of course produced in 2013. 

This made me wonder, what's the worst, most off-topic or hilariously bad piece of literary theory or criticism you have read that made you guffaw or just nearly sigh with torpor when you read it?
