Account manager VS Creative director,mircofragomena,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/li7m4e/account_manager_vs_creative_director/,1,3,"Ok it's not really a VS but..

I work at a not-very-up-to-date communication/brand agency, and I'm the creative director.

I'm in charge, now, to restructure the agency in its creative processes and departments.   
Until now, the ""creative"" role was given (taken) by the 2-3 account managers. They'd do brainstorms with the team (them, a graphic designer, a strategist..) but they'd be kind of in charge of deciding the tone, style, feel, the do's and dont's, the good and bad, of all the process and outcome of the project.

Now, for the first time, we have a creative/art director there (hello!) and I need to teach them (push them away) their role and get my space as a CD/AD, my responsibilities and all..

  
I do have quite an idea of what are my responsibilities and what theirs, and how to structure the team, the steps, the collaborations, between different people and projects and clients..

Though, I want to hear your opinions, backgrounds, if anyone had similar problems, or just what you'd do/define if you were me.

Thanks!!"
