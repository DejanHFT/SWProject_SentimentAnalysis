"Why does developing new battery technology seem to take forever, and rarely have results as positive as expected?",deten,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2srhep/why_does_developing_new_battery_technology_seem/,27,222,"When we look at batteries, many of the times we see pretty straightforward elements.  Lithium, Carbon Fluoride, Zinc, Magnesium, manganese dioxide...

Why is it so hard to just use properties of elements to predict newer and better Batteries?

Take EEStor.  I remember in like 2006 they were going to revolutionize battery storage yet here we are in 2014 with relatively nothing to show.  Countless other examples exist of the next energy storage that still doesn't exist.

What makes making batteries so hard to predict theoretically and then produce actually?"
