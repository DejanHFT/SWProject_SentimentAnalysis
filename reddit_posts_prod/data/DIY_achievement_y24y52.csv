diy blown in insulation question for first timer. 100+ year old home.,jjax2003,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/y24y52/diy_blown_in_insulation_question_for_first_timer/,55,106,"i have a quick question about the project i am working on.  I have framed in an attic / loft space and put r22 rockwool insulation in the walls and ceiling.  i want to blow in to achieve r50 in the attic/ceiling.

this old house only has 2 vents to the outside in the attic (gable ends), no vents from the soffits or anything like that.  on the loped portion on the attic ceiling there is a air gap behind the insulation.  

When I blow the insulation is it okay to blue all the way to the edges?  If i do that on the sloped sides I will be essentially trapped air in there that has no way out.  hopefully this makes sense.

dos the air behind the sloped walls/ceiling ned to be able to get to the top of the attic to vent out?  or can i simply blow insulation and cover the entire flat portion of the attic?"
