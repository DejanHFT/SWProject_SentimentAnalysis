Do bodybuilding and Calisthenics mix well?,Kash1sh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/70ggwq/do_bodybuilding_and_calisthenics_mix_well/,9,4,"I am doing bodybuilding right now but I've been falling in love with Body weight Excercises more and more. I figured I could do Calisthenics in the morning and Gym at night. 

So, can someone who does/has done both guide me if it'd be a good idea to do both. Also, will it result in overtraining? "
