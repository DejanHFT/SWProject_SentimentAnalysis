How can they simplify the three body problem enough to be used by modern computers?,SmokinReaper,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/i6763y/how_can_they_simplify_the_three_body_problem/,181,2108,"Warning, I only got through first year calculus and it was many years ago.  I watched that short video explaining what makes the 3 body problem so hard.  Can they reduce it to something more like a two body problem by acting as if the center of mass between star A and B is one body and the center of mass between star B and C is a second body to help get it closer to solvable (for example)?  I'm just wondering if there is way to explain how it gets simplified enough for modern computers to attempt to solve it.  A way which a non grad student+ in physics/math might be able to understand.
