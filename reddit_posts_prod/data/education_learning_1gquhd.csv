I'm giving out reddit gold to people who take a survey related to online learning,eink21,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1gquhd/im_giving_out_reddit_gold_to_people_who_take_a/,123,31,"Hi r/education!

I'm thinking about creating a website that would connect anyone looking to learn professional and personal skills with the people who can best teach those skills, but first, I wanted to make sure my website would be solving problems that actually matter to people.

So, I've created a survey (a little over 3 pages long, which takes around 20-25 minutes to complete), and I thought that this community might have some folks willing to take the survey in exchange for a month of reddit gold.

If you're interested, just add a comment (or PM me) and I'll PM you back to get your email address. I'll then email you the Word document, you'll add your responses, and then you'll email it back to me.

**Update:** For those of you whom I mentioned to check out this update, I only have 5 months of Gold remaining that I can give out (giving out 50 months in total, and I've given out 45 so far), so I think I'm going to have to do this... You can download the survey from [this public SugarSync link](https://www.sugarsync.com/pf/D7121265_4586881_043935) or [this public Dropbox link](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/25203573/Learning%20Site%20Survey%20v2.docx) if the SugarSync one doesn't work, then fill it out and email it to me (my email address is listed in that file). The first 5 completed surveys from this point forward will get the remaining reddit gold. (Sorry that I can't give it to everyone)."
