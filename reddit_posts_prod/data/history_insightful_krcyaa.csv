Spaniards/Incas & Silver and Gold,Great_Sandwiches,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/krcyaa/spaniardsincas_silver_and_gold/,8,3,"I have always wondered how two civilizations that had never previously met had BOTH come to covet silver and gold. What was the inherent value that people saw in these metals?

The Spaniards came seeking it, and were at one point in their conquest of the Inca offered rooms full of it as appeasement.  The Inca knew it's value.  They not only discovered it, but mined it, smelted and refined it, and fashioned it into jewelry and other objects of value.

How was such a thing possible across thousands of kilometers of ocean, and untold years of technological development between them as civilizations?

EDIT:  Very insightful comments in response to this question.  Thank you, gents."
