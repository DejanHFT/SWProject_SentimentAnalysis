"I have 2-3 months time to travel, should i visit one country only to explore or multiple countries ?",FlyingArcher_,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/19e4c33/i_have_23_months_time_to_travel_should_i_visit/,10,2,"Hello everyone, I’m (M23) just graduated from university and i’m planning to go to Europe this May to July as a graduation gift. I’m so excited as it would be my first time solo traveling. This will be my second time in Europe. The first time i went there i visited 5 countries (Italy, Switzerland, France, Belgium, Netherlands) for 18 days and i dont really enjoyed it and felt it was too rushed.


Now that i have 2-3 months travel time i really want to explore Europe again. But i don’t know whether i should only visit one country or multiple countries. From the previous visit, i know i want to explore Italy   again. It has so many bucketlist and interesting places for me that it can last more than 3 months to visit them all. I also think that by visiting Italy only i can learn about the country more, the culture, and the language.  But at the same time i also really want to visit new countries/places ( Portugal, Spain, South of France, Malta, Switzerland and others).


I can travel for 2-3 months now because i still don’t have a job. After i work i probably don’t have that much time anymore to explore . I’ll probably still go on vacation annually but with limited amount of days. Europe is also really far from me as i’m from Asia."
