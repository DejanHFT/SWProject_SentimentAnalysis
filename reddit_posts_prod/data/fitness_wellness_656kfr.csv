Conditioning to be more well rounded?,AT-Life,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/656kfr/conditioning_to_be_more_well_rounded/,16,1,"Any tips for fitting in some conditioning that's not just running? I'm a collegiate ultimate player, and im trying to get in better shape for the summer club season. So, I started nsuns 4 day LP 5 weeks ago and have progressed nicely. Now that I have a good base of strength, I'm looking for places to fit in cardio; 2 Sprint/speed emphasis days and 1 distance emphasis. I'm not doing this to cut; I just want to become faster and have a higher fitness level when on the field. As of next week I'm switching to the 5day LP because my upper body lags; I also plan to do my conditioning on upper body days. Any tips would be appreciated. Thanks.
