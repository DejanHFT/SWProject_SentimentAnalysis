Stay Away from Creative Circle,overanalysissam,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/41p3zw/stay_away_from_creative_circle/,51,44,"So I'm sure you've heard of Creative Circle and generally most people aren't successful in getting work from them after being spammed with it left and right. 

I on the other hand have had success landing a few projects with them, at the expense of having my rate be cut in half without even the clients knowledge. I understand 10,20, hell, even a 30% cut, but over 50% for work you don't even do?

I've had a good long working relationship with my clients and they contacted me in person to hire me for a massive project they have in the pipeline. My contact decided to make sure this type of deal was okay to make outside of Creative Circle after we both gawked at what my hourly rate was (10% less than what the client was paying and 60% more than I was receiving) and gawked a little more when we both realized how much I was getting paid versus how much they were paying.

Now this is why I love these people. They got someone from their legal team to speak to Creative Circle about working directly with them. She tried to look through any loophole or exception and she couldn't. The way they write those is specifically designed to keep an airtight seal on you, make you look like an employee of the company, for which the client has to pay 25-50% of your salary if they want you. Who the hell is going to pay $55k JUST to hire you? It really sucks man.

Thankfully my clients are passionate about this. We're gonna have to work with them until the client has the extra funds to buy out my contract. Which is crazy that a company would do that, makes me wanna cry out of thankfulness. Take my advice: Don't work with Creative Circle. I wish I could figure out how to boycott the company. They're just as toxic as sites like Fiverr and Elance to the industry. Actually... Is there something that can be done to stop this shady scheme?"
