"Should one relapse (me 39f, him 40m) equal game over? Does that make me the least supportive partner ever?",Best-Guitar-8159,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ij3zjg/should_one_relapse_me_39f_him_40m_equal_game_over/,24,19,"**Background**: together 5 years **before I moved out**. He was a functional alcoholic. He'd often (as in every single week) go out drinking after work and never bother contacting me. Often would stumble in after midnight. We had so many fights about this. He also would never drink WITH me (as in, he'd never have a glass of wine if we went out to dinner).

He was often obnoxious when he came home. I also suspect shady things went on at times while he was out. I caught him in a couple of lies as well. He'd always tell me he was with his drinking buddy, but I'm unsure if that's true (since the drinking buddy is married with young kids). I have no idea.

**The Incident:** I found out one night when he stayed out drinking that he had actually texted a woman that he works with to come drink with him. She's hot and I'm pretty sure he wouldn't have asked her to come along if she were unattractive. He also lied to me about where he was. I found out before he got home (she called me to make sure he made it home ok because he was smashed...she told me it wasn't romantic at all but still, the fact that he went out with her in the first place and lied to me was awful).

&#x200B;

I confronted him when he got home and he was drunk and hostile and pushed me backwards hard enough that I stumbled. That's when I decided to move out.

**After I Moved Out (1 year ago):** He stopped drinking cold turkey. He went to AA meetings. He went to therapy. I still see him regularly but don't live with him. We are still together, but we don't live together. I'm still cautious.

My job became very busy right when his contract ended and he hasn't found another one yet. He has become pretty depressed as of late, and I am not coming over as often (usually I see him once during the week and stay over 1 night on the weekend...my job will be busy like this for about another 3 weeks then it's back to normal hours).

Tonight is one of the nights I could see him. Earlier today (while I was still at work), he decided for the first time in a year to meet up with his drinking buddy. He's still with him and when he texted me he admitted he's drinking.

It triggered me. It reminded me of all the times he'd stay out getting drunk (for years). It reminded me of the uneasy feeling I had not knowing where he was (a bar? a strip club? who knows, I never knew). I also never really knew who he was with, his communication was very limited with me (sometimes would tell me his phone had died...for hours). I'd lay awake in bed waiting for him to come home. Sometimes it would be 12:30am, sometimes 2:30am. My anxiety would grow.

He's done so well for a year. But this one night of him being out getting drunk with his old drinking buddy is bringing back the horror that I lived with. And I can't believe I accepted that as my life for so long. I also guess I really don't trust his judgement when he's drinking.

&#x200B;

Part of me feels I should ask him where he is and go get him and bring him home. He did so much hard work and he's out there getting drunk with his enabler. But the other part just feels like I should block him and move completely on from him. But wouldn't that make me the least supportive partner ever? 

&#x200B;

I don't know what the right thing is to do. Any ideas?

&#x200B;

tldr: partner was sober for 1 year and now getting drunk due to being depressed and me being unavailable. Struggling to know if I should go bring him home or if I should block him for good."
