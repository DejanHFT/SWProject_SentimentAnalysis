G Adventure Questions and Confusion,Glutenfreepancaker,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17p44pt/g_adventure_questions_and_confusion/,9,1,"Hi all! This is my first time using g adventures and I am rather confused. I downloaded the app, but there is no place to actually pay for the trip (other than the initial booking fee). Also, for all add ons it states to reach out to your booking agent. How do I find my booking agent? Iâ€™ve used customer service chat twice, but there is nobody I can directly reach out to otherwise for questions. Thank you in advance for your help!"
