How do I recreate melodies from other songs,Morganafan1337,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/wta9f7/how_do_i_recreate_melodies_from_other_songs/,9,0,"So, I'm trying to recreate melodies from other songs but no matter what key combination I use or scale, it doesnt sound like the melody that i'm trying to recreate, even counting the amount of notes doesnt make it sound like the actual melody that i'm trying to recreate, I use FL Studio and FL Studio Mobile to compose and practice, I have experience with FL Studio for 2 years believe it or not.  Say I'm recreating Megalovania from the funny Sans Skeleton meme, I try to recreate the first four notes but no matter what even with tutorials, It doesnt sound like Megalovania, even lesser the part that comes after the first four notes, which looks like it was keys pressed randomly.  So how should I recreate melodies from other songs by just listening to them?"
