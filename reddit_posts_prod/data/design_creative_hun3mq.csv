Creative Resume or Traditional Resume?,sonoforiel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/hun3mq/creative_resume_or_traditional_resume/,9,7,"Hey all.

I’ve had a nice colourful resume for a while now with all the classic touches of my design personality incorporated and have had a hard time getting feedback from prospective employers.

My question to you is should I abandon the bright and colourful “creative” resume for something more stripped back and basic?

Thanks for your advice!"
