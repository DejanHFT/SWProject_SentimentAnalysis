How do I [26F] get my BF of 4 years [37M] to be less 'helpful' and more caring and supportive?,ThrowRAantisocialgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mdyg3e/how_do_i_26f_get_my_bf_of_4_years_37m_to_be_less/,15,3,"I'm running into a pretty huge relationship problem that I have no idea how to solve. I feel like I can't bring it up without getting upset, or making him upset, and I am so exhausted and wary of fights I don't want to bring it up at all, but I know it won't get better on its own.

My boyfriend has OCD and a controlling streak. He grew up in a very abusive environment where if things weren't ""perfect,"" he would be abused/tortured, and unfortunately that mentality has carried over into adulthood and he reacts very strongly to minor things, i.e. a kitchen sponge being too dirty. We have worked really hard on his nitpicking tendencies and he's made real progress at not 'pointing things out' (criticizing) or correcting me these past few years. Honestly, he's gotten so much better.

But as these problems resolved I started to see a new one: he feels like it's his role to 'teach' me things that my parents neglected to teach me. Now, I'm not saying I have great parents. They didn't pay a lot of attention and just left me to my own devices most of the time. But now, I am an adult, and I don't need to be 'taught' things by my partner. I need him to see me as an equal, not a kid or a fuckup who needs 'fixing.' Sometimes it's less overt than that, but I'm being honest here... I'm not sure he could get through a day without telling me something I should be doing or the way I should be looking at something (especially if I tell him something is bothering me--I usually get ten minutes of well-intentioned but incredibly frustrating talk about how I should 'see the bigger picture' and not let this thing bother me. I know that! But it is bothering me anyway!)

I brought this 'teaching' tendency up with him and it almost led to me ending it. I said, straightforwardly and calmly, that he is not my therapist or life coach or parent, and those roles are incompatible with the role of a supportive romantic partner. He... disagreed. He claims that to love someone is to challenge them to be their 'best self,' and when I said that sounds like he doesn't love me the way I am, he says that saying things like that doesn't mean he doesn't love me the way I am. Often, when I bring up what I see as the hurtful implications of what he says, he claims I am 'twisting his words' because he didn't mean them to be hurtful.

The thing is, I really do believe he wants the best for me, and he loves me, and this 'teaching/helping' is his way of showing that.... but it's just not making me feel any better and in fact, I think it's hurting my self esteem quite a bit.

Also I can't shake the fact that he treats me badly. That if a stranger heard the way he speaks to me sometimes, they'd be uncomfortable. When I'm trying to help him with a computer thing, for example, or placing a takeout order online, he'll snap at me continuously. ""No I didn't mean X, I meant Y."" ""That price doesn't make sense."" ""I didn't want X added to the cart, I wanted Y."" He sounds very impatient and annoyed, which is hurtful when I am going out of my way to help him. NSFW warning:>! It even extends to sex, now. Our sex life is still great, but sometimes he'll get exasperated that I'm cocking my hips the 'wrong direction' or am in the 'wrong' spot on the bed, causing him to balance off the edge, or something, and I'm just like... can you at least act like you enjoy having sex with me/are grateful that I'm here having sex with you, instead of focusing on the negative???!<

Like I said, I have tried bringing these things up with him and he has made some progress, but at a certain point I feel like I shouldn't have to explain basic kindness to him, or that he hurts my feelings consistently. I have also tried leaving, but he becomes so devastated. I do believe he loves me and wants things to work out, and despite everything I've written here I love him too. Therapy unfortunately isn't an option because we don't have the money. I don't know what to do. Any help is appreciated.

tl;dr: My boyfriend thinks he is helping me, but the things he says/does don't make me feel good or cared/for supported, and I don't know how I can explain this in a way he will hear and understand. But he has made progress on other relationship issues, so I would like to fix this."
