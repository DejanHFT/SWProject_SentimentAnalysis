"Bin Laden Raid: Can ""hyperspectral imagers"" like those used by the CIA potentially see through regular building walls? Can any other technology potentially do this from a distance of a couple hundred meters with line-of-sight?",FFLaguna,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/pxkkp/bin_laden_raid_can_hyperspectral_imagers_like/,151,395,"Hyperspectral imaging was apparently used by CIA agents from a nearby safehouse while conducting surveillance on Osama bin Laden's compound in the weeks before the raid. Additionally, hyperspectral imagers were also reportedly used by some of the military personnel who accompanied the Navy SEALs on-target during the actual raid.

In the process of surveilling the bin Laden compound, could hyperspectral imaging have allowed the CIA to see through walls and determine, for instance, the number of people inside a walled courtyard or residence? Are there any other technologies such as millimeter-wave or radars that could look inside?

And during the actual raid, what would hyperspectral imagers have been used for? Perhaps searching for false wall panels or buried caches that would give off slightly different spectral signatures?

Thank you.

**Edit:** And a quick refresher, *hyperspectral imaging* refers to splitting up the visible light spectrum or the non-visible light spectrum into various wavelengths and replacing this information on a computer screen with colors we can view. Exactly how and why various wavelengths are chosen varies depending on the project, whether it is a hyperspectral optics package for a military user, or whether it's a false-color imaging space probe."
