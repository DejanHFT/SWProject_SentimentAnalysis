G Adventures Hostels & Optionals,youcancallmealalalal,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ux0f4w/g_adventures_hostels_optionals/,5,0,"Hi for those who have experience travelling with G Adventures …can you speak to the quality of hostel that the company uses? What can I expect when being in a group dorm? Also looking to hear a bit more about how the optional activities work - do most people in the group do the same activity? Do you have to select all of your optional activities at the start of the trip or go day-by-day? 

This will be my first time travelling solo and I’m looking to go to the Dalmatia coast (Croatia, Albania, Montenegro, Greece)"
