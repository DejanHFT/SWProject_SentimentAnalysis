Is there such a thing as Dichotomy or is it all combinations?,mradsomer,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/qxhvx/is_there_such_a_thing_as_dichotomy_or_is_it_all/,2,0,"What is the point of Dichotomy if we are just mixtures/combinations of everything? Seems like classification gets us nowhere in life (Null/solipstic), and only stagnates our existence or takes away from it.

Deleuze (an [essay](http://www.kurator.org/media/uploads/publications/DB04/Koppensteiner.pdf) I read that's influential)

Huxley-Doors of Perception

Sartre-[Existentialism is Humanism](http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm)

Nietzsche-BoT and On Truth and Lies 

all give major contributions to this discussion: Nihilism->creating your own meaning in life->rhizomatic living of a nomad->balancing everything

All of this, I feel, relates to dichotomy in the sense that: In a single day I could develop thoughts and habits that can be broken down and classified into various categories to be justified, yet in that day I end up being the result (making classification null? due to a never-ending strive for perfection through understanding that cannot be accomplished in a lifetime and the possibility). Then I could be the opposite person the next day in terms of classification ect.

If you have your own thoughts please engage. If you have resources to provide for a much better in-depth on one or multiple opinions please provide.

This is a purely contemplative and learning experience for me (and hopefully for others)."
