What product/ service would you want to exist to make your life easier as a designer/ creative?,Jackattack1291,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/10nbxk9/what_product_service_would_you_want_to_exist_to/,6,2,"This question counts towards one of my university projects. With this assignment, I want to create a product/ service that can be used by other designers to make their workflow/ design process more efficient. 

One of my ideas I have is a dedicated app/website for collecting feedback for graphic designers and creatives in the industry. Something along the lines of the user filling out 3 feedback forms in order to post their own. This will ensure that people are giving more feedback than receiving."
