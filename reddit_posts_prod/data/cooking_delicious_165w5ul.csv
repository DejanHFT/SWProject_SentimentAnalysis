Best ways to repurpose bread that isn't very delicious (recipes that will make mediocre or subpar bread taste the most delicious)?,burnt-----toast,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/165w5ul/best_ways_to_repurpose_bread_that_isnt_very/,25,11,"I recently tried out a new bakery that I've never been to before, and I bought a loaf of their sourdough. It just isn't floating my boat. The crust isn't very good, and the texture and flavor of the crumb isn't the best either. Toasting hasn't improved it - it just makes it taste still like mediocre bread with a not-great crust, just now warmer and slightly crustier. I was thinking about cutting some up for bread pudding or strata, but I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for any other dishes that can turn bread that's mid into something really delicious.
