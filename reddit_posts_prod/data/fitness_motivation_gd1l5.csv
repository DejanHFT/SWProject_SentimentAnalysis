Losing motivation during cut and how to get rid of the belly?,wimpingwombat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/gd1l5/losing_motivation_during_cut_and_how_to_get_rid/,49,18,"So I've been cutting for 12 weeks now, and I've seen change, but after 12 weeks I expected to lose my belly.  I've been on quite a strict 'timed carb diet' which has lead to fat loss and little/no muscle loss.

Is this the kind of progress you expect to see after 12 weeks?  Everday, I've basically been eating 1800-2000 calories:
6am breakfast: 2 eggs
9am meal: mince/sausages (handful portion)
11am meal: handful of almonds
1pm meal: mince/sausages (handful portion)
3pm meal: mince/sausages (handful portion)
7pm meal: steak and vegies

On workout days (6am every second day), I have a dextrose shake and protein shake straight after.

My aim is just to lose the belly so it's flat or some kind of 6pack shows.  What else can I be doing?  What is holding me back?  Is it the muscle or is it fat?  I want to get back to eating a normal diet.

Anyway, pics are here:
