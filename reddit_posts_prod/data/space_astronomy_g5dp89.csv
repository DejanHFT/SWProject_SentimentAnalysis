"Yesterday I saw multiple (10+) Starlink satellites pass over at 22 pm in the Netherlands (currently ~360 launched), this makes me concerned with the proposed 30,000 satellites regarding stargazing. Is there anyone that agrees that such constellations should have way more strict requirements?",Skydawne,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/g5dp89/yesterday_i_saw_multiple_10_starlink_satellites/,1993,11552,"I couldn't get my mind off the fact that in a few years you will see dots moving all over the nightsky, making stargazing losing its beauty. As an aerospace engineer it bothers me a lot that there is not enough regulations that keep companies doing from whatever they want, because they can make money with it.

Edit: please keep it a nice discussion, I sadly cant comment on all comments. Also I am not against global internet, although maybe I am skeptical about the way its being achieved.

Edit2: 30.000 is based on spaceX [satellite applications](https://spacenews.com/spacex-submits-paperwork-for-30000-more-starlink-satellites/). Would make it 42.000 actually. Can also replace the 30.000 with 12.000, for my question/comment.

Edit3: [a Starlink visibility analysis paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab8016) in The Astrophysical Journal

Edit4: Check out [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/g5dp89/yesterday_i_saw_multiple_10_starlink_satellites/fo3jjpn) for the effects of Starlink on Earth based Astronomy. Also sorry I messed up 22PM with 10PM."
