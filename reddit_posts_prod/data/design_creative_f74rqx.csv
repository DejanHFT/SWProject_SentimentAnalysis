What are some technical/non-creative design jobs out there?,BraveRice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/f74rqx/what_are_some_technicalnoncreative_design_jobs/,7,1,"I'm currently working as a creative at an agency and it's starting to get to me. And I'm curious if there are any non-creative and more technical side of design jobs exists. I feel like building out 3D models of mechanical parts are not very creative and more technical...

Hope you can enlighten my non-creative mind. Thanks.

Edit: As far as my current skills go, I know how to use Illustrator, Photoshop, Premier, Aftereffects, etc. I have all the basic knowledge of the programs and some more. I'm dipping my toes into 3D design if it leads to more technical designing. I just want to cut the time of trying to be creative to being more autonomous to building things and staying busy. "
