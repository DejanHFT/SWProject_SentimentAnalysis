How to learn better and to memorize what I learned?,JOSEPHDEPTH,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/i8pk9h/how_to_learn_better_and_to_memorize_what_i_learned/,24,6,"I'm begging you guys for some advice! I'm desperate to learn what can I do to improve my memory and smartness. I'm tired of being a slow learner and I want to learn but I'm so dumb and my brain have this weird mental block and distracts to something else. I want to understand algebra 1 and 2, chemistry and all of other sorts. I go to a charter school so everyone there is smarter than me because they just are I guess. They just learn it in 15 minute lecture and they got it while I have to stay after school and do the damn thing with a teacher by my side. I'm a really horrible test taker too! I'm scared if this stuff man. I'm going to 11th grade in a couple of days and thanks to online school I have an advantage but I need to become smarter but not just for school, for college and life in general. I don't want to be that slow, awkward anxiety riddled kid with poor motor skills and embarrasses himself every day. Got any advice?"
