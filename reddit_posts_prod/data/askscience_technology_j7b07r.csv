"AskScience AMA Series: We're from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and from Washington Maritime Blue and DNV GL. Our organizations are working together to bring the safe use of hydrogen to these ports for a cleaner energy future. Ask away, we're here to answer your questions. AUA!",AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/j7b07r/askscience_ama_series_were_from_the_pacific/,190,2393,"Hi Reddit, Happy National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day! We;re Jamie Holladay, David Hume, and Lindsay Steele from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Jennifer States from Washington Maritime Blue and DNV GL. Did you know the use of hydrogen to power equipment and ships at our nation's ports can greatly reduce energy consumption and harmful emissions? Did you know that the transportation sector contributes 29 percent of harmful emissions to the atmosphere-more than the electricity, industrial, commercial and residential, and agricultural sectors?

The nation's ports consume more than 4 percent of the 28 percent of energy consumption attributed to the transportation sector. More than 2 million marine vessels worldwide transport greater than 90 percent of the world's goods. On land, countless pieces of equipment, such as cranes and yard tractors, support port operations.

Those vessels and equipment consume 300 million tonnes of diesel fuel per year, produce 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emission, and generate the largest source of sulfur dioxide emissions.

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and collaborators are looking at how we can help the nation's ports reduce energy consumption and harmful emissions by using hydrogen as a zero-emission fuel.

We've conducted a [study](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/10/f68/fcto-h2-at-ports-workshop-2019-viii3-steele.pdf) with several U.S. ports to assess replacing diesel with hydrogen fuel cells in port operations.  We've done this through collection of information about equipment inventory; annual and daily use, power, and fuel consumption; data from port administrators and tenants; and satellite imagery to verify port equipment profiles. We crunched the data and found that hydrogen demand for the U.S. maritime industry could exceed a half million tonnes per year.

We are also seeking to apply our abundant hydrogen expertise to provide a multi-use renewable hydrogen system to the Port of Seattle-which will provide the city's utility provider with an alternative clean resource.

Our research is typically supported by the Department of Energy's [Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-and-fuel-cell-technologies-office).

We'd love to talk with you about our experiences and plans to connect our nation's ports to a hydrogen future. We will be back at noon PDT (3 ET, 19 UT) to answer your questions. AUA!
