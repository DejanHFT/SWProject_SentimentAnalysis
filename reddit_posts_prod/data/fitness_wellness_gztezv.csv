Does increasing weight on accessory movements really matter as long as you are progressing well with the 3 compound movements?,fitzy50000,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/gztezv/does_increasing_weight_on_accessory_movements/,120,876,"I am a 21 year old, 186 pound male and am doing a 6 day split; I’ve been progressing well with the Big 3s:
Deadlift: 375lbs
Squat: 300lbs with ATG
Bench: 250 (building back up to this though)

I have done well with these but don’t really do mich higher weight with accessory lifts after I usually do any of those three workouts depending on the day. I always felt like it was better to do lat pull down, leg extensions, curls, rows, etc. at a weight range where I can do 8-12 reps with good muscle contraction. Never really found my self to really do heavy duty weight on lots of accessory movement exercises like for example; on lat pulls I usually struggle to keep good form beyond 120 pounds but I can also still do pull ups for 8-10 reps well. Am I right to think making big increases in these movement isn’t a huge deal as long as I’m doing well with the big 3s?"
