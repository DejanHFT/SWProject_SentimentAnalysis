Temporary Rhinestone Fringe,No_Shopping4406,https://i.redd.it/czqfhlm0bngb1.jpg,2,0,"Hi all! I'm attempting to achieve the above for a bachelorette party. The theme is diamonds and denim and I want to attach the fringe in an easy way that won't require much work to take off.
Would water soluble thread work? I worry it may melt with sweat from dancing or in the likely chance a drink was spilled on me or something.
Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!"
