I’ve been struggling with maaaassive creativity block since late 2019 due to personal reasons which sucked the total life out of my brain. Ever before that i was writing and drawing all the time. It kind of was fading a bit right before the big block kicked in, but now it’s just nothing. 

With the new year coming up i really wanna get into writing again. Ive tried a couple of times before, with a project from 2018 that ive been meaning to rewrite for a while now, but i just couldnt. Every word i write it’s just meh. There is no creative though up in my head that gets me going. I thought i just have to come up with a new idea to write about instead, and let the other project sit for now, but i cant come up with anything. 

Ive been reading a lot though and that really has been enjoyable for me. Im still into all the stuff i like (i love fantasy books for example). Im motivated to read. But im not motivated enough to get up and write. 

Any tips for me? Is it about creating a routine and sticking with it through the downs? How to get some inspiration when you’re completely blank up there?"
