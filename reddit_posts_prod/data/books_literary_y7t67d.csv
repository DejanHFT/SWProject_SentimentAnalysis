What literary characters are very useful as adjectives.,Hargelbargel,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/y7t67d/what_literary_characters_are_very_useful_as/,10,0,"For example, I find describing people as a Chicken Little is useful for people who think the world is going to end just because of some minor cultural change or some misconception of science.

From the story Harrison Bergeron, I find it useful to describe people as a Diana Moon Glampers or a Handicapper general if they are always trying to overcompensate for differences between individuals by dragging people down to the lowest level. Or just anyone who doesn't' get the purpose of art.

I use these not to be pretentious because I find the short cuts useful. I'm assuming others have useful shortcuts as well. Some character from a novel or movie that is so distinct in flavor but not unique in this world."
