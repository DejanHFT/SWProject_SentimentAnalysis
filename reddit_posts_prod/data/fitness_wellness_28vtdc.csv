"Well, this is a new development: Lifting & Anxiety?",BlackLeatherRain,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/28vtdc/well_this_is_a_new_development_lifting_anxiety/,46,19,"My anxiety got so fucking bad this morning that it was a choice of walking out of the office or walking into the gym here on site.  I chose the gym, and began lifting a normal routine, concentrating on lifting to failure with each set.

Within 10 minutes, I had forgotten I'd had anxiety at all.  After the whole routine, I'm just too goddamned tired to worry about Anxiety any more.

Have any of you experienced this?  I know dopamine and all that happy horsecrap, but I've never - ever - had this kind of an immediate response to exertion.  Have I found the holy grail of anxiety control?"
