What is a typical Creative Director salary in the U.K? (fintech/insurance industry),eliza3594,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/14sd2vn/what_is_a_typical_creative_director_salary_in_the/,0,1,"Hi, 

I’ve been offered a promotion within my current company (fin tech/insurance) as the Creative Director - promotion from current role as Lead Digital Designer. 

I’ve carried the company forward a huge amount visually since I started, however this will be the first Creative Director role they are appointing. 

So I’m wondering what is a reasonable salary to ask for? It’s an insurance company doing very well, started small (40 employees) and growing quickly (now 250+) in the last two years, based in Manchester. 

What are the typical ranges for a Junior Creative Director? 

Thanks in advance!"
