Fitness/wellness for adults?,wrigh003,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3sahpr/fitnesswellness_for_adults/,1,0,"Hi all- I've been asked to lead a wellness/fitness effort for a set of remote/ traveling teammates, and am looking for ideas of how to connect us all, as well as thoughts for how to conceptualize ""wellness"" for the team- all with the understanding that most of us need to be met where we are, and that not everyone is looking to turn into a gym rat. We all meet in person roughly monthly, and I'll likely be asked to talk about various aspects of fitness/ training/ updates on what we're all into, etc., on that schedule.

Stuff I am thinking of:

* Tracking individual efforts via web-based apps (MyFitnessPal, Fitocracy, RunKeeper, Strava, etc.), probably not in a centralized way, but more of letting folks know these things are out there. A lot of people don't know.

* Group competition via Fitbit (seems to be the most popular tracker, with ~40-60% of the team already having some variety of Fitbit. I'm an outlier with a Jawbone, but that's all right).

* Suggesting that at least periodically we work a healthy cooking class or sport/ group exercise class or something into our rotation of ""team-building"" exercises- at present a lot of the time those include a heavy dinner at a nice restaurant (read: calorie bomb!) likely followed by some kind of ""let's go get beers/drinks"" sort of event. My approach will be... different.

* Taking the initiative to lead group runs (ack. I'm a weightlifter, not a runner. Dammit...) or morning exercise efforts (park bootcamp or tai chi or something) somewhere around the hotel when we all get together. 

* Getting a nutritionist to come in and talk to us about nutrient partitioning, etc., as we get deeper into the project.


Overall, I need to keep it fun and light- mostly information sharing and encouragement/ coaching vs. ""DO THIS!"" Participants range in age from 23-45, and while none of us are incredibly obese or anything, I'd need to structure this in a way that could be inclusive for folks that are- so walking has to be acceptable as well as marathon or triathlon training. 

Thoughts? I'm spitballing on this, but interested in what people have to say. 

(About me: mid-30s fitness hobbyist. Am 6'2"" tall, and have run the gamut from orca-fat at 310# or so down to low-200s in my adult life. Currently splitting the difference at about 255#, but actively training as a powerlifter and MMA enthusiast/participant. Build like linebacker, it comes up on every airplane I get on. :|)"
