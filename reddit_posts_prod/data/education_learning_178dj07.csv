Idea for AI Video Learning Assistant,Prestigious-Potato-5,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/178dj07/idea_for_ai_video_learning_assistant/,1,2,"Hi, as someone passionate about self-education and overwhelmed by the amount of content published, Iâ€™m exploring building an AI tool to enhance self-directed video/podcast/article learning. It would have features like:  
\- Searchable transcripts to instantly find relevant moments  
\- Condensed video/chapter summaries  
\- Personalized quizzes to boost retention  
\- Inbuilt related content / more-in-depth content recommendations   
\- AI-generated study plans & learning paths  
The goal is to help people learn more efficiently from online resources. Would tools like this benefit students? What pain points could AI solve in video-based learning? Are there existing tools I should look into?
