"Creative professionals, how do you find inspiration within a strict time frame?",The_Liberator21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/5xw2bh/creative_professionals_how_do_you_find/,43,119,"I started my first full-time job this year, on the Creative team at a mid-sized tech company. I often feel like I need to come up with creative ideas ""on demand"". In business school, creative ideas seemed to be a nice bonus to whatever assignment I was doing, so very low pressure. Now my job requires that I come up with creative ideas fairly frequently, and I'm not used to the new pace and expectations. Any advice? How do you find inspiration and great creative ideas within a strict time frame?"
