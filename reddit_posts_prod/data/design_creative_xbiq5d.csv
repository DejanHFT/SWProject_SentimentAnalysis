A creative life - My design career,boazzippor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/xbiq5d/a_creative_life_my_design_career/,1,17," I Have launched a new section to my youtube channel ""a creative life"" : My design career.   
After thirty years as a designer, working for international companies and owning and running a couple of design businesses myself, these are some things i have learnt and would love to share with you.  
these are not tutorials, and not even real advice. these videos are more food for thought, things to consider, things to remember. Enjoy!
