Why is the idea of immortality commonly viewed as undesirable and bad?,Moontouch,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/15k4dm/why_is_the_idea_of_immortality_commonly_viewed_as/,38,4,"I came across the following quote from Nietzsche's *The Gay Science* which was very fascinating for me and sparked a period of contemplation. We all know of that great experience philosophy can bring.

> ""What if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more' [...] Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.""

If we live a pleasant life with minimal suffering and great happiness, is this not a reality we would want to experience multiple times if not indefinitely? When I discuss immortality with people it seems as if the majority view the notion as highly undesirable, sometimes pointing to the great suffering in life. However, if we work to improve our condition and make the lives of each other more pleasant than bad, why would we say no to wanting to continuously experience this?

I am reminded of one final quote by Nietzsche from *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* which I very much like:

> ""But we certainly do not want to enter into the kingdom of heaven: we have become men, so we want the kingdom of earth."" 

This topic is no doubt very broad, conversational and debatable so I am interested in your opinions and how life got you to it."
