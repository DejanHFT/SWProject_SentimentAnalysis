Best Websites for Finding Long (30+ days) Travel Adventures?,yoqiu_,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/193dwrd/best_websites_for_finding_long_30_days_travel/,3,0,"I'm looking to take an extended trip this summer outside of the USA, ideally something that's like 60+ days. I want to buy a package that has an itinerary, hotel, etc. already arranged. I'm looking for websites that focus on budget adventures. There was this AMAZING website I came across that had adventures as low as $600-700 USD in Africa and South America. It was a bit outdated but was the absolute best website I had ever come across. Unfortunately I forgot the website name lol"
