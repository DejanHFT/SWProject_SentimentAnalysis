G Adventures Camping Tour Advice,yaqult143,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/126b54g/g_adventures_camping_tour_advice/,5,2,"Hi everyone, I'm planning on going to a 14 day G Adventures camping trip to Canada, and I just wanted to get some general advice on what I should pack, cause honestly I think the only time I went camping was at my friends backyard. This is my first time solo traveling and going on a group tour, and I know that G Adventures provides a list of essential items to bring, but it's kind of overwhelming and a lot, especially by the fact that they recommend you to pack lightly. In general should I bring a small suitcase?, how many clothes should I bring?, etc.

Here's the exact tour I'm panning on going this June: [https://www.gadventures.com/trips/canadian-rockies-tour/7711/?ref=wishlist](https://www.gadventures.com/trips/canadian-rockies-tour/7711/?ref=wishlist)"
