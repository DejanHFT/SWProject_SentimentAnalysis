[First update after surgery](http://redd.it/35pnnu)

It's been a while since my last update but since you've all been so nice to me and my sister with your help and wonderful wishes I think I should give an update.

First about my sister's recovery: It has been more difficult than we've expected. She's had many side effects from the surgery and the speed that things are getting better is not as the doctors hoped. She has problems with movement and sensation in her left side, sleep problems, vision and hearing issues. She also used to have some mood issues but those are mostly resolved. Doctors expect her to make a full recovery though, but it may take some years of rehab and hard work. She has great motivation these days so we're very optimistic.

About parents, well I don't know where to start. They didn't make any contact until 3 weeks after the surgery. They were upset that my sister hasn't called them. I told them to piss off and don't contact us again. A week later they showed up at my sister's place, they didn't even know that she had moved out of her place and moved in with me, how could have they known when they don't care? They called me angrily asking where their 'daughter' is. I told them that maybe she died after the surgery and hung up. I know this was cruel but I couldn't play nice with them anymore. They called me again but I didn't answer. They came to my door, I opened the door but didn't let them in. I took a very strong punch in the face from my dad but I still didn't let them in and told them to fuck off and went inside. My dad threatened to break the door, I told them that I'm calling the police and if they do anything crazy they will be in jail for breaking and entering. They told me that I'm disowned and left.

My sister was sleeping during this. I told her everything and she was happy with how I handled it (which is all that matters to me). We had talked about what to do if something like happened. I'm not sad that they disowned me, we had disowned them long before that. It's just the two of us now.

   
**tl;dr**: My sister's recovery is going slow but it is expected that she will make a full recovery. Parents showed up but I didn't let them in. They disowned me."
