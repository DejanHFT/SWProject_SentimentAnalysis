Friendship Advice - Friend does not think I am emotionally supportive enough after a break up. What should I do?,Annual-Assist-8015,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12oojk1/friendship_advice_friend_does_not_think_i_am/,3,3," 

One of my very good close friends (m22) has just recently broken up with his girlfriend of quite a few years and is going through a rough patch. I (m22) met him yesterday and he very hesitantly told me that he had recently just broken up with his gf (much to my surprise) because I had seen him regularly since it had happened and I was none the wiser that anything had occurred.

The thing is he essentially told me that he had something very emotionally sensitive happen to him recently and did not want to tell me what happened out of fear that I would spread it around or something (much to my shock).

When he mentioned this, he also added that if I am to tell anyone our friendship is over. He further told me that he feels I am never there for him emotionally, which made me feel very upset because I want to be there for him, I don't understand why he would feel this way. Naturally this really upset me and idk how to approach it with him. We always spend time together and talk about everything, but I obviously feel quite saddened by the fact that my friend essentially doesn't trust me. I have never spoken behind his back and I am always there for him.

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Any advice at all as to how I can approach this would be much appreciated. I just feel down in the dumps and powerless and feel guilty that I have done something wrong when I haven't.

TL;DR - friend broke up with gf and thinks I am not emotionally supportive enough"
