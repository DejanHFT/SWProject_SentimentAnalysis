Online BS in Astronomy?,Epicinium,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/qr14d9/online_bs_in_astronomy/,19,8,"Iâ€™m very interested in pursuing a degree in Astronomy or some other space related field, but less on the engineering side of things. More on par with like, astrophysics I guess. I work a pretty taxing job so it would have to be 100% online. Any advice? Thanks!"
