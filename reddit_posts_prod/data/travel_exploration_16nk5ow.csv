Good to explore Italy in December with Contiki?,hopenooneiknowsawdis,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16nk5ow/good_to_explore_italy_in_december_with_contiki/,13,1,"I’m a 24 year old who’s looking to go to a tour across Italy through Contiki. Anyone who’s been to the same trip around this time?

I’m mainly stuck with two doubts in my mind:
1. Would December, and more specifically, Christmas time a good time to visit Italy? Or is the weather going to be a major spoil sport?

2. I am looking for the social travel with a grouo of other people from across the world, and should be okay with the partying but hate to spend too much time travelling in coaches through the trip, hence going for a lighter trip focussed on a single country hoping it would be a but more relaxed. Any experiences or opinions there?

Thanks!

Feel free to DM if you wish sharing something there! Thanks!"
