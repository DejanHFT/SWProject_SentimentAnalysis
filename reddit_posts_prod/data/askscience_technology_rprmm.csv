what are the most likely/most feasible propulsion technologies for travelling in outer space?,Jizzmaster_zero,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/rprmm/what_are_the_most_likelymost_feasible_propulsion/,28,24,"I was reading about some of the moons around Saturn and how they are presumed to be primarily made up of hydrocarbons... This made me wonder, what propulsion fuels could we use? (and also: would hydrocarbon powered engines work in space? - no oxygen, but are there means to make combustion engines work) I'm not necessarily wondering what the fastest propulsion methods would be, but more what would be the most feasible fuels and means we could use for propulsion (e.g. ion, solar, etc.)"
