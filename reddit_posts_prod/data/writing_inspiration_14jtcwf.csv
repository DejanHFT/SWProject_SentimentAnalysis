What inspires you to write?,MythalsBlessing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/14jtcwf/what_inspires_you_to_write/,13,1,"Hello! Iâ€™m sure this has been asked a multitude of times, but I know that I struggle with motivation and writers block often, so I was curious how other people break in the blank page!

For me, I know that listening music and watching movies inspires me to think of my own worlds. However, what actually gets me to put the words on paper are usually prompt generators lol.

So what really inspires you to turn your thoughts into stories? Also, what inspires you to have those thoughts in the first place?"
