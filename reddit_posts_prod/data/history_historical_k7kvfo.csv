Any Historically Accurate Films like The Witch (2015) that faithfully capture the time period?,FeynmansRazor,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/k7kvfo/any_historically_accurate_films_like_the_witch/,557,1852,"Cross post from r/MovieSuggestions

The Witch is a horror film, and in my opinion it's the most historically accurate film I've ever seen. How is that possible? Well, I'll try not to reveal spoilers, but basically I found the realism of the setting and characters phenomenal. You see, in the story, it's possible to interpret the events as the result of an encounter with actual witches or hallucination from bad crops, but this kind of misses the point. Because at its core, I think you are supposed to watch the film as a representation of what belief in Witches actually looked like in the Early Modern period. And in that sense it's accurate. To people in that time period, magic *was* real.

Here is Eggers describing some examples of detail in that film during an AMA:

Accents. ""It was my best interpretation of a common person's Caroline English from Yorkshire. Some of the grammar is maybe a bit more Jacobean than Caroline, but there was more books available on Jacobean English, and coming from a Shakespeare background, it was familiar to me. Regardless, many historians have given it a thumbs up for 1630.""

Clothing. ""I wanted ALL hand woven cloth, but we couldn't afford it. We used it where we could, but Linda Muir (costumes) found excellent machine woven wool that is very close to the real thing.""

Stories: ""So many stories were inspirational. Check out the Goodwin Children in Boston and Elizabeth Knapp from Groton. Many many others, but they are two famous ones.""

The realism heightens the supernatural elements, and vice versa. But what I am really looking for is a film that captures the same level of historical detail. Are there any films with realistic detail like the Witch? Personally, I haven't seen anything recently that comes close, except maybe Scorsese's *Silence*."
