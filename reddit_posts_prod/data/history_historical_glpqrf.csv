What historical structure/building (no longer in existence) would you most want to see in person?,Ngreenspan,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/glpqrf/what_historical_structurebuilding_no_longer_in/,97,74,"I would most want to see the Lighthouse of Alexandria. I have always been fascinated by the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World and while they are all historical and structural marvels in their own right, I think that viewing an ancient, towering lighthouse would be a really cool experience. I'm looking forward to seeing which structures y'all are interested in!

A second building I'd love to see is the Karnak Temple (in its heyday) in Luxor. I'm fascinated by a lot of Ancient Egyptian temples and pyramids. The Great Pyramid when it still had its outer limestone layer and the gold cap would be another building I'd like to see.

Edit: Added the second paragraph."
