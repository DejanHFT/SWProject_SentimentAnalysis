Does anyone know the name of this traditional Algerian / Berber melody?,Kyranks,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/17f4lau/does_anyone_know_the_name_of_this_traditional/,1,2,"Does anyone know the name of this traditional Algerian / Berber tune?

I’m looking for the name of the first tune played in this set:

https://youtu.be/GO9gnHmB4oI?si=f1k2SAXrR4n5OM6D

On the album, it is simply named “Berber Tune”

It’s also found on this older album also by Pierre Schryer (this tune starts at about 1:43):

This melody was apparently picked up by one of Pierre Schryer’s band members at an Algerian/Berber session near the Toronto area in the late ‘90s or early 2000s?

Any help would be much appreciated!"
