How do you seek inspiration without copying said inspiration?,graysk-,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/u8q3f7/how_do_you_seek_inspiration_without_copying_said/,5,1,"Hello all, new Reddit user here... and a fairly new writer. I am constantly drawn to romance novels and love a good tragedy. But yesterday I kinda started writing whatever came to mind, and I ended up with an opening to a Sci-fi story. I have never read nor written anything in that genre... I was wondering if I could have some help here? I tend to write romance because I know the feeling of being in love and I don't need any inspiration for that. But with how much is unknown in space I feel like I need to go to other books. Now I fear that because this isn't my usual genre I will copy a character or a feeling someone else wrote. I tend to do that after watching a movie as well. Does anyone have any tips? Is this something that I can totally make up as I go? I want to incorporate an alien of some sort or a whole other galaxy with a different kind of human. But I am also the kind to think an alien is small, lanky, and green with big eyes. I want the story to carry a serious vibe not comical but I don't know how. 

Would reading a fantasy novel also help? I find those hard to get into as well... I feel like anything out of the every day norm is hard for me to visualise and that's where the copying starts."
