Please help! My roommate Joseph Sjoberg is missing. Please Help!,nate_elsas,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ef4ak/please_help_my_roommate_joseph_sjoberg_is_missing/,446,778,"My roommate Joe Sjoberg (pronounced: SHOW-BERG) has been missing since Tuesday. We live in Madison, Wisconsin. Joe was last seen on the near East side of Madison, WI. Baldwin at Sherman. The police are involved and are doing all they can, but I know the power of Reddit and if there's anything anyone can do to help, message me or comment here. Joe is about 5'9'', 180-200 lbs. He has short (not very short) brown hair and greenish eyes. He had about three or four weeks worth of beard when I last saw him. May be wearing a hoodie, maybe a ski jacket. He took his grey shoes with red trim; they're casual sneakers, a bit beat up. Joe drives a grey '91 Caprice with Washington state plates 513-WYN, which is also missing.

Edit: Thanks again to everyone who's commented with advice and kind words. We're counting on local law enforcement and all your eyes out there and I appreciate all the help. I'll make updates if the situation changes.
