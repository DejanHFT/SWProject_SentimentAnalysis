"For centuries Middle Easterners have been drinking Sahlab in the Winter. It's a sweet thickened hot drink, that can be flavoured with Coconut, Orange Blossom, or Rose and it's popularity almost caused the extinction of a key ingredient. Recipe for delicious instant Sahlab inside (sans extinction)",ObiEff,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/kx5pc5/for_centuries_middle_easterners_have_been/,270,4642,"If you've visited the Middle East or it's surrounding countries in Winter, you've probably seen people drinking something that looks like a mug of hot milk. What they had in their hands was Sahlab, a thick and sweet hot drink that is loved for its taste and great warming abilities. It's an old drink that was consumed as far back as Ancient Rome, Industrial Britain and all over the ottoman empire, but now has sadly been forgotten to the world except in the Middle East (and a few select countries). Today I'll show you how to make [instant Sahlab powder flavoured with coconut and how to use it](https://imgur.com/a/sqM5Dra), and I'll also tell you how you can make the other varieties as well.

## What is Sahlab or Salep
In it's traditional form, Sahlab or Salep is a drink made from crushed orchid tubers. While we think of Orchids as house plants, there are over 20000 different species of orchids, and a large number of them grow [small starchy tubers](https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p04hnc1h.jpg) below the ground. These tubers have a distinctive flavour, which can be described as similar to Taro or a sweet earthy flavour, and they contain an important ingredient for the making of this drink, Glucomannan. Glucomannan is a naturally occurring thickener, and similar to corn starch or konjac it's able to turn a cup of milk into a thick runny liquid. Unfortunately real Salep got so popular that many species of wild orchids were harvested to near extinction in Turkey. As a result the Turkish government has placed bans on the export of Salep powder, and there are only a few producers of sustainable farmed Salep in Greece. The good news is that most drinkers of Salep aren't actually drinking Salep at all. In nearly all countries including Turkey most salep powders are made using a combination of corn starch and other thickeners and flavourings.

Instead of traditional Salep, this recipe makes the variety of sahlab that you'd find in Egypt where it's flavoured with coconut and sesame. The result is a drink that tastes similar to coconut macaroons or coconut cake. Usually the drink is [topped with nuts, sultanas and desiccated coconut](https://imgur.com/R0CLjvq) before serving, which makes for a pleasant drink that you can also chew on. Because of it's thick texture it retains heat really well, and as you drink it you can feel the warm liquid trickling down your throat which is a strangely comforting feeling especially during a cold dessert winter. In some Levantine countries, sahlab is instead flavoured with orange blossom or rose water which results in a bright floral flavour profile. 

Most people buy the sahlab mixture premixed from spice vendors or from the supermarket (it's available on amazon US and UK) and it's a simple matter of heating it with some milk to make a warm mug of sahlab. Unfortunately I have found that nearly all premixed sahlab just tastes flat so I experimented until I came up with this recipe. The key ingredient here is Coconut Milk Powder and it's an ingredient that is used in a number of South Asian and Caribbean cuisines, it's essentially dehydrated coconut milk and it gives a strong coconut flavour to the drink. Most recipes I found called for desiccated coconut instead, but I found it resulted in a gritty texture and it had less coconut flavour. Apart from the coconut milk powder, I've also included rice flour in this recipe as it gives the drink a distinct starchy flavour that is present in actual Salep. All the ingredients for the Sahlab are sifted together and the resulting mixture will keep for up to a year in an air tight container. To make a cup of sahlab, you simply heat a cup of milk with a 1/4 cup of the sahlab powder until it thickens, then you garnish it with your desired toppings.

## Cultural Context

Like I mentioned salep is an extremely popular drink and it has been that way for centuries having been drunk by the Ancient romans and later by the Ottomans. Apart from the texture and flavour, Salep was thought to be an Aphrodisiac, so much so that the Ancient Romans called it Satyrion and Priapiscus (I'll leave you to google those). Looking at [how the orchid tubers grow](https://pfaf.org/Admin/PlantImages/OrchisMorio.jpg), you can understand why someone might draw such a conclusion. In fact some theories say that the word Salep comes from the Arabic word Thaalab (ثعلب) which means fox, for the resemblance the tubers bear to a foxes anatomy. Last summer I made stretchy ice cream using some Greek Salep powder and it turned out delicious, you can (check out the recipe here)[https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/i45hy4/every_week_i_cook_a_new_middle_eastern_recipe/]

Salep even made it's way over to [industrial Britain](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/01a6bd_58782d7019d04b7887b568120a74bb0d~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_758,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/01a6bd_58782d7019d04b7887b568120a74bb0d~mv2.jpg) where it was sold under the name Saloop. [Carts all over the city](https://janeaustensworld.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/womansellingsalop.jpg) would sell Salep made using milk or water and using the flour of local marsh orchids. Legend has it that the popularity of saloop declined after its association with venereal disease, and the carts were soon replaced with ones selling coffee and tea instead.

In the modern Middle East, Sahlab is drunk much the same as Hot chocolate is in the west. It's a sweet treat that you can get at a cafe to warm yourself up, or made at home for when you want to chill out on the sofa. Some people make the mixture extra thick so it can be eaten with a spoon and others chill it and eat it cold as well.

## Flavour Profile
The main flavouring of this Sahlab recipe is Coconut, this drink tastes similar to coconut macaroons, bounty chocolates or coconut cake without being too coconutty. You also get a lot of nice flavour from the toasted sesame which gives the drink a slight nutty flavour. The mastic acts as a background flavour, and it gives the drink a light pine aroma, but you likely won't notice if you leave it out. Likewise with the vanilla it's also a background flavour, it just makes the drink taste a bit more rounded and if you leave it out it won't be too impacted. The rice flour gives the drink a starchy flavour similar to horchata and without it, it just doesn't taste the same. Finally the Milk powder gives the Sahlab a slight malted flavour, and a creamier texture.

If you choose to make the Levantine Sahlab instead, you'll have a bright floral flavour profile.

## Ingredients

### Egyptian Coconut Sahlab (Makes about 10 measuring cups worth or about 5-6 mugs)
* 1 Cup Coconut Milk Powder
* 1/2 Cup Milk Powder (can also be replaced with coconut milk powder for a stronger flavour)
* 1/2 Cup Rice flour
* 1/2 Cup Powdered Sugar
* 3 Tbsp Sesame (1 extra tbsp for topping)
* 3 Tbsp Corn Starch
* 1/2 Tsp Vanilla Powder (Vanillin)
* 1/2 Tsp Mastic

### Levantine Sahlab
* Replace the coconut milk powder with regular milk powder
* You can leave out the sesame if you want, it's not always used here
* Per cup on the stove you'd need to add between 1/2 - 1 Tsp of Orange Blossom or Rose Water

### Possible Toppings
* Chopped nuts (Pistachio, Almond, Hazelnut)
* Desiccated coconut
* Toasted Sesame
* Sultanas
* Ground Cinnamon or Cardamom

### Per measuring cup of Hot Sahlab drink
* 1 Cup (237 ml) of milk
* 1/4 Cup of Sahlab powder 

## Directions

### To toast the sesame
1. Place the Sesame in a dry pan over medium heat
2. Shake the pan every 15-30 seconds making sure to rotate your sesame seeds from the bottom to the top of the pan
3. Toast the sesame until a light golden color, then immediately remove from the pan. They will continue to brown after removal

### To make the Sahlab Powder
1. Crush the mastic in a pestle and mortar into an extremely fine powder
2. Sift together all of the ingredients apart from the Sesame seeds. If you don't sift it, the mix will be clumpy and won't evenly combine.
4. Add the sesame seeds and mix everything together very thoroughly
5. Store in an air tight container for up to a year

### To make the hot sahlab
1. Measure your mug of choice in US measuring cups, and multiply the ingredient amounts by the result
2. Add the milk and Sahlab powder to a pot on medium heat
3. Whisk together until the mixture thickens (about 5-10 minutes)
4. Pour out the sahlab into your mug and let it cool for a couple of minutes before topping with any desired toppings

## Tips and tricks
* Preheat your milk in the microwave to just below boiling to speed up the cooking process, but be careful not to let it boil
* If you want to make this vegan, you can replace the milk powder with more coconut milk powder and use any replacement milk when cooking
* You can put some toppings in the base of the mug as well as on top, this makes it easier to decorate while still getting a good amount of toppings
* If you can't find coconut milk powder, you can use dessicated coconut instead. Just process it really finely in a blender."
