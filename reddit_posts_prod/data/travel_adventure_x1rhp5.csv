Help me decide my first Europe adventure?,Chelsmania,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/x1rhp5/help_me_decide_my_first_europe_adventure/,14,2,"Simply based on airline ticket prices out of NYC, my debate is between Barcelona and Milan/Rome in late January for 1-2 weeks.

I'm not an experienced traveler and I come with a heavy dose of anxieties about new things and people. I think going on the off season would help with some of that. 

I don't think I could wrong with either but was curious if there were any strong arguments for one or the other, particularly being that it's the middle of winter but searching other subs it sounds like winter may not be terrible in either city.

My goals are mostly to explore, see the sights, taste the foods, probably a little road trip. Would be great to keep it below $1K per person, estimate so far was $360 for the flight, $50/day for a hotels for a week. $150 to keep my car parked at the airport. 

Need to do more research on getting around in either city, but what's transportation like?"
