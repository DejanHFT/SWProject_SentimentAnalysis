Greece adventure/sporty sailing tours?,cardamom_t,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15h01nk/greece_adventuresporty_sailing_tours/,1,2,"Hello! 

I'm (26F) looking into doing a sailing tour, probably in Greece but open to other places if there's something really good elsewhere, as a solo holiday in September.

Wondering if anyone in this sub has a recommendation of a tour that focusses more on the sailing than partying and going ashore...? There seem to be so many options online of Greece/Croatia trips for 20-30 year olds from companies like Medsailors or Yaghtweek, but not sure they're really my vibe. I'm a beginner sailor but lots of outdoorsy experience and looking for something on the sporty/adventurous side where I can actually learn a bit of sailing. The only good one I've found is one with [Join the Crew to the cyclades](https://join-the-crew.com/en/tours/sailing-cyclades) but it doesn't run for my dates :'(

Anyone got any recommendations of companies to look to go with? Would really appreciate any pointers!!

Thankssss :)"
