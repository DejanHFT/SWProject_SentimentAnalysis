"Friends not supportive of my girlfriend (17 M, 17 F)",Decent_Ad_2843,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/140h41a/friends_not_supportive_of_my_girlfriend_17_m_17_f/,10,1,"I am a junior in high school and relatively new to this particular school, having transferred here last year.

I have about four close friends, but have sort of drifted from them as I've been dating a girl in another class, who I'll call Chloe. She is not only absolutely beautiful, but has this confidence about her that drives me nuts. She is also super laid-back and I just like being around her.

My friends have known Chloe for longer than I have and say she's not terribly nice. I strongly suspect they wouldn't welcome her into our group, as she apparently used to pick on one of my friends a little bit, but this seems to have stopped.

I've been hanging out with my friends a lot less often since I started dating Chloe and were no longer all that close. I did tell one my friends how great I think she is and he just sort of laughed.

I dint think they're jealous or anything like that. They just don't like her, it seems. I feel sort of bad about ditching my friends, but I really like this girl as well.

Thoughts?

Tl;dr My friends dislike the girl I'm dating and I have drifted away from them"
