"I'm 16, around 6'0 and my BMI is well... 15.4 should I be concerned?",GonnyFTW,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/e48cy1/im_16_around_60_and_my_bmi_is_well_154_should_i/,42,16,"I don't suffer from anything, I'm healthy and mentally stable, always eat as I should but never seem to gain weight. I'm still growing and I'm really afraid not to go below 15 BMI because that's when a person is considered anorexic, I know this has to do with genetics because even my father and my uncles were severely underweight in their teenage years and after 20 all of them gained a lot of weight.

The thing is I can't do any sport activities because of my body mass and always get tired and dizzy when I try to. I really hate myself sometimes because I really want to play sports but I simply can't. I have a really fast metabolism and doctors told me that's the reason. Should I be concerned of my well being? Should I try going to the gym?"
