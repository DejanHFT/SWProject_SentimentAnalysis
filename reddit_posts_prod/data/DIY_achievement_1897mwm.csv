Concrete casting chess set,Fresh_Dingo8031,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1897mwm/concrete_casting_chess_set/,1,1,"Hey everyone,

I have a set of chess pieces that I 3D printed, and I want to go through the process of creating a mold and casting them with concrete. Every guide I've come across seems to say very different things about materials and products they recommend, and I was hoping someone with a very strong opinion can set me straight on a couple things.

1. Recommendations on brands/specific concrete mix products? My biggest worry is the concrete doesnt quite catch fine details like the crowns on the king/queen, the tip on the bishop, or the curves of the knight.
2. Coloring — products/advice on how to achieve a white/off-white color for one set, and a grey/dark gray/black color for the other
3. Penetrating Sealant — is this necessary? I don't really want to loose that natural concrete look or feel, but maybe smooth it out a little bit and give it a slight matte look in the light.
4. Mold — urethane resin or silicone? It looks like urethan resin might be better for reusing the same mold and capturing detail when working with concrete, but curious to hear what you think
5. Mold release — any recommendations for products?

What do you guys think?"
