Ravenous, directed by Antonia Bird, is a bonkers Western horror movie that centers on cannibalism. Second Lieutenant John Boyd (Guy Pearce) returns from the Mexican-American War of 1847 and is honored and promoted to captain for defeating the enemy. But, when a high-ranking general discovers his cowardice in the war, he sends John Boyd to Fort Spencer, an isolated military outpost in the Sierra Nevada, for his next assignment as a third in command. The flashback scenes show how Boyd cowardly played dead on the battlefield and was tossed into a mound of dead bodies, where the blood of one of the dead men entered his mouth. After that, he managed to escape and seize the area previously occupied by the Mexicans in an unexpected and sudden act of bravery. When he gets to Fort Spencer, a genial Colonel Hart (Jeffrey Jones), the commanding officer, greets him and introduces him to the other officers: a drug addict Private Cleaves (David Arquette), a drunk Major Knox (Stephen Spinella), a native American brother-sister duo named George and Martha, and a straight-faced Private Reich (Neal McDonough). One night, a stranger named Colqhoun (Robert Carlyle) shows up at their door half-dead, frostbitten, and hungry, and he tells a story about how he and his fellow travelers got lost in the snow and had to resort to cannibalism when they ran out of food after getting trapped in the cave. Captain Hart and his team, along with Calqhoun, go to the site to check whether anyone’s still alive. However, before they leave, the Native American George informs Hart and Boyd of an ancient myth about how individuals who eat other people gain their strength and develop an insatiable appetite for human flesh.
