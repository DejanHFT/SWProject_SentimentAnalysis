What is with the newer film critiques on youtube? Its like they are treating movies as strategy games.,opiate_lifer,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1165b97/what_is_with_the_newer_film_critiques_on_youtube/,51,50,"Random example is critiquing characters for not being emotionless AI devoted to a singular goal. Fictional example but I could totally see a criticism of a character caught up in a zombie apocalypse who is pregnant not instantly aborting or euthanizing the baby to increase her chances of survival. And I am like.....wtf?

Or a character who has even in flashback been shown as arrogant, continuing to act arrogant and make missteps due to this. This is not a plot hole!

Or saying why hasn't the villain's long time right hand man ever made a play for the throne? Maybe he doesn't to rule?

The villain's daughter is obviously rebellious and an enormous liability, why is she not killed at the first opportunity? o_0

Somehow characters not all acting like perfectly rational, near omniscient AI is a plot hole instead of you know good writing.

Not that there can't be good observations of plot stupidity mixed in."
