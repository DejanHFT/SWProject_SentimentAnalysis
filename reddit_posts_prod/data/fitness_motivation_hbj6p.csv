exercise and motivation for my obese life,mpmusic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/hbj6p/exercise_and_motivation_for_my_obese_life/,29,14,"i'm tired of being obese!

first a little bit about me:
i am 22, weigh around 480 and i'm starting to loose circulation in my feet/legs.

i can walk, but cannot run much because i loose my breath to quick.
when i do walk i cant seem to go far without my lower back aching which makes me want to stop immediately because it gets sore, but granted this is probably because i am not used to being active.

i work from home, i record music, so while i'm working i'm constantley in the sitting position.
when i wake up, i shower, then imedatley go to my computer to work, browse reddit. or just spend most of my time at the computer. 

anyways i went to the doctors the other day because i've been getting what started out as a rash on the top of my right foot. and i never bothered with it. 2-3 months later its spreading up my leg. so i see a doctor and he tells me i have something called venous circulation. basicley i'm not getting enough circulation in my feet. he says its not life threatening but i need to start exercising daily.

i am very intimidated by the gym. i go there and all i see are skinny  in shape people. granted they are in shape because they've been working out. but i just dont feel confident. its like if i were to get on the tredmilll there just happens to always be some skinnier person next to me, always running faster. or it seems like its a competition.
the last time i went to the gym i used the tredmill and could only last 10 minutes before i had to stop.  and i was walking. i felt like a huge failure that i cant last 10 minutes without giving up, getting all sweaty and breathing really hard trying to catch my breath.

i figure i could do the bike, but the seats are small and they hurt my butt, i cant get comfortable enough to use it.
i figure the bike would be the best machine for me and my legs. i cant use it.

the next logical thing for me is to maybe higher a trainer.. when i was younger i had 2 trainers, but i felt like they never really seemed to motivate me or help me. it just seems like they give orders, stand around and seem like they would rather be elsewhere. to me this makes me feel like trainers are a waste of time and money. Plus being obese and doing some excersizes a fat person could do is different. there are some things i cant do because of my size and i feel some trainers dont seem to understand that. 

does anybody have any advice for me?
what are the best excerszes for an obese person?
whats the best diet i can take? ect

looking forward to you guys's answers.
