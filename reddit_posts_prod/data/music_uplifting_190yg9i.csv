What songs do you listen to that are uplifting or bring you joy?,DJSlaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/190yg9i/what_songs_do_you_listen_to_that_are_uplifting_or/,130,72,"I find some songs are incredibly uplifting and  whenever I need a bit of a lift, I'll reach out to these, and just feel better.  They just grab me.  This is a sample:

Kamasi Washington - Truth

John Coltrane - My Favorite Things

Floating Points and Pharoah Sanders - Promises

Cortex - Chanson d’un jour d’hiver

D Town Brass - Human Resources

Pat Metheny - Phase Dance

Return to Forever - No Mystery

Ronnie Laws - Always There

Stan Getz & Luiz Bonfa - O Morro Nao Tem Vez

Stanley Clark - School Days

Edit:  new addition 

Sault - Free 

Mind you, these aren't songs I'd listen to to get ready for a race, for example, which is a totally different list.

Which songs do you find uplifting?
