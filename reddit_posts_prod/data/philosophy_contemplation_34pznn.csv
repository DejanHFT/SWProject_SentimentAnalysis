Ethics and A Clockwork Orange,impossiblereality,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/34pznn/ethics_and_a_clockwork_orange/,142,282,"**'A Clockwork Orange' has always been one of my favourite books, however, like a lot of the book's readers I take umbrage with the final chapter.**

**For those unfamiliar with the book, I shall go over the narrative so you can fully understand my issue with the novella's closing pages. If you've already read the book, scroll down.**

The novella is split into three distinct parts.

Part I is about the illegal exploits of a gang lead by the book's main character 'Alex'. The actions they perform include theft, property damage, assault, rape (including the rape of two pre-adolescent girls) and eventually (in the closing sequence of this part) murder. Resulting in the murder is the arrest of Alex and the revelation that Alex - a murdering, rapist - is fifteen years old.

Part II. Alex is now in jail. Numerous violent incidents occur between him and a cellmate, thus revealing that not only is unremorseful of his previous actions but that he's happy to re-enact them onto other individuals. Eventually he is moved to a different cell and becomes very close to the priest in the jail, not due to serious religious belief but because he enjoys reading the violent passages in the bible. Rumour spreads around the jail that there is a way to get out of a sentence quickly and released back into the world, so long as you go under a treatment known as the 'Ludovico technique'. Alex signs up for the Ludovico treatment. The treatment ensures that Alex physically cannot perform or even think about acts of violence (no matter how small), because by doing so he feels physically sick, he gags and feels nauseated. There is a particularly interesting sentence which reveals that these feelings kick in when Alex contemplates harming a fly. In other words, Alex does not choose to do good, but by proxy he is made to do good by forcibly being repelled to do bad (baring in mind that the novella deals with a binary and stereotypical ideas of good and evil). Deep down Alex wants to rape, murder and torture but due to the state's psychological treatment forced onto him, he cannot. The treatment eventually ends and Alex is ""cured"" of the ""criminal instinct"". A minor note in this part which later on becomes important is that Alex also feels physically ill when listening to music as before, in Part I, listening to music - especially beethoven's 9th - would stimulate in his mind images of rape and violence.

Part III. Now released into the real world, Alex bumps into the people he met before, including several of his victims who take their revenge on him, he even bumps into members of his old criminal gang who are now revealed (in satirical fashion) to be policemen. But of course, Alex cannot defend himself, as thinking about committing violence makes him feel physically sick. After being beaten up by his old - now policemen - friends, Alex goes off into the night and discovers a house, he knocks on the door begging for help. Of course, because of the novels symmetrical structure (he meets the victims which he met in Part 1 in Part 3), Alex bumps into one of the victims of his most violent escapade: the writer who was beaten up and made to watch his wife being raped (who eventually died due to it). The husband does not recognise Alex because during the rape, Alex and his gang were wearing masks. The husband is a political activist who is against the government's ludovico treatment due to his strong libertarian convictions. Eventually, the husband discovers who Alex is, locks Alex in a room and then plays beethoven for minutes on end for the purpose of revenge (Alex thus then feels physically sick). Due to the nausea and intense pain Alex goes through, Alex then ATTEMPTS suicide, and fails. The suicide attempt is then all over the papers and is presented through the idea that the government's programme lead to Alex killing himself. Alex is then sent to hospital and the treatment is reversed: in other words, he no longer feels sick when thinking about rape, theft, murder or making anybody else suffer. He now has the freedom to perform such actions

**Then we come to the final chapter. The final chapter reveals that Alex has now chosen to be good and has chosen to never commit such evil acts which he did during his younger years. In other words, the final chapter answers the question which it poses throughout: ""Is it ethically correct to remove the freedom to commit evil acts in the hope that society is made a safer place?""/""Should goodness be imposed onto somebody or should goodness be chosen?""**

**I find the final chapter problematic for many reasons but the main one is the artistic quality of the novella: to me it is more interesting if the novella poses a morally-complex question than answers it or provides a digestible message. It's more intellectually troubling - throughout, the novel poses so many interesting questions (Authoritarianism vs Libertarianism perhaps the largest one - specifically in how to deal with crime) and it seems to be a cop-out to not only answer it, but answer the questions in a blunt and unsubtle manner.**

**Essentially I have two questions:**

**(1) What are your thoughts on the final chapter? Do you find it convincing? Do you find the 'answer' ethically suspect or ethically correct, or neither?**

**(2) Presuming that the final chapter is removed and the novella is left with the ethically complex cliffhanger of Alex now being able to choose between good and evil, what are your opinions in regards to the main question of the novel:**

**Should the state strip an individual of their own freedom to choose evil in order to make them good? Or should the choice of whether to be good be up to the individual and never the state?**


EDIT: Alex did not commit suicide then wake up from the dead! This was a typo on my behalf, to which I have now edited...Alex ATTEMPTS SUICIDE by jumping out of a window, it fails."
