I [26f] got an amazing job offer and my husband [26m] is not being supportive.,nneedsomeadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7zcrz7/i_26f_got_an_amazing_job_offer_and_my_husband_26m/,185,223,"My husband and I are best friends, very much in love, and have been married less then a year (together since we were teenagers). I recently received a job offer from an amazing, prestigious company at a very high salary. 

Throughout the interview process, my husband was less then enthused while I was ecstatic about having the opportunity to interview at such an amazing company. The reason my husband was not excited about the job is that it would require us to relocate out of our current city to another.

My husband works remotely (unpaid - he’s working on some projects that have not yet panned out) and, currently, we live next to his family. If we move, we will still be in the same state as his family but a 5 hour car ride/ less then one hour flight away. 

I start the new job in less two weeks and I have been looking at apartments in the area near my new company. My husband is adamant about staying at an expensive, resort-like (salt water pools, two story gyms, club house) apartment complexe while I would prefer we stay at a more mid-range apartment in a safe area where we can save a lot of money. We can afford the resort-like apartment with my new salary but... I can’t help but feel like it’s a tremendous waste of money. I’ve tried to explain this to my husband but he states that I am uprooting him from his family and he does not want to move unless his standard of living improves. 

I’m hurt because I wish my husband was as excited for this new job as I am and I don’t understand why it’s so important for us to have such a superfluous apartment. If the tables were turned and he received a job offer from a top company at an exceptional salary, I would be over the moon proud of him. 

How do I talk to my husband about this issue? I love him and I don’t understand why he has been acting like this. I’ve tried talking to him about this but every time I bring it up he says he doesn’t want to move because he is comfortable where he is now, likes being very close to his family, and will only move if we get the “perfect” apartment. 

TL;DR: I received a job offer from a top company at a very high salary. The position would require relocation and my husband is very apprehensive about moving. How do I talk to him about this? "
