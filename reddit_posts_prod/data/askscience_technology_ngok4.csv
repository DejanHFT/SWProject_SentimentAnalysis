"Is the ""brain in a vat"" scenario actually possible with today's technology?",mdiamond,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ngok4/is_the_brain_in_a_vat_scenario_actually_possible/,24,25,"More specifically: if we removed someone's brain and placed it in an apparatus where it would receive all the nutrients that a normal human brain would receive within the body, would this result in a person's mind being able to live for as long as the apparatus operates (albeit with absolutely no sensory input)? And if so, is this possible with today's technology?"
