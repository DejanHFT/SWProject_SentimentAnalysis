Robocop (1987) is a perfectly paced and structured movie.,Saint_Stephen420,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/87xfdn/robocop_1987_is_a_perfectly_paced_and_structured/,220,589,"I just finished watching this masterpiece of a movie for what is probably the tenth time, possibly more, and it always astonishes me how tight the plot of this movie is. The movie gets a ton of retrospective praise for its satirical writing and critique of the militarization of city police forces, consumerism, and the ""let's act like everything is fine when the world is going to hell in a handbasket"" attitude of the 1980's, and rightfully so. But the pacing and structuring of the movie are what impresses me every time I watch it. Every scene serves a purpose to advance the plot, nothing drags it down. Each scene feeds into the next in some important way, pockets are set and exploited within reason, everything ties together neatly and that's what really makes this movie special, 30 years down the road."
