"Fully remote, sellable business models?",Wannabeballer321,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/19bvfuh/fully_remote_sellable_business_models/,1,2,"I’ve been in entrepreneurship for a few years, and in that time I’ve discovered many different hustles.

The most lucrative one I have found so far has been residential solar sales.

I’ve also realized that unless I start my own solar company, which I have zero desire to do, I’m not building up an asset that I can eventually sell.

I’ve considered starting a different business because of this, like a digital marketing agency (saturated, but may work).

I work with a highly reputable, solar installer, so getting paid should not be an issue, even if I spend a ton of money on ads.

With that said, there is no telling what could happen down the road, especially if I don’t get paid for some reason and have to sue, so the safest and most logical route feels like outright owning a business."
