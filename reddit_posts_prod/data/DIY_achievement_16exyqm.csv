What's the secret to crafting a wall like this?,Such_File6983,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/16exyqm/whats_the_secret_to_crafting_a_wall_like_this/,3,3,"I'd love to recreate a wall in my room that looks similar to the one in the picture. I think I've got the hang of achieving that multicolored background effect on the wall, but here's the catch â€“ I'm not really experienced in construction, so I'm a bit stumped on how to create the top layer. I'm guessing it might be plaster, which I can work with, but what's really puzzling me is how they achieved those subtle shades, especially the white and various shades of gray.

I'm completely flummoxed by those areas that seem to resemble freshly applied wet plaster (like the part to the right of the blue cushion). Some sections look like they were done in one sweep with a plastering trowel, but the plaster in those areas has different tones. Unfortunately, my lack of experience has me scratching my head on how to pull this off.

Is there a kind soul out there who could help explain this to me? I've scoured just about every topic on YouTube and haven't come across a single video that sheds light on this particular issue, so I thought I'd give this forum a try. A massive thank you in advance for your assistance!
