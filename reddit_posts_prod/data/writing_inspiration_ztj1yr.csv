Inspired Writer Stories,kustom-Kyle,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/ztj1yr/inspired_writer_stories/,4,0,"I can’t stop writing! 

Since 2020 especially, ideas and stories are flooding out of me. I love it and have only written for myself. I finally hired an editor last year for my book about traveling the world for 10 years. She has been very helpful in changing a few things, but overall “loves it” (in her words), yet she understands my patience in furthering my next draft. 

Since, I’ve written two movies, an animated film/graphic novel, two television series, several children’s books, and I’m now writing the television series that I think will actually gain some traction. This year, I’ve been traveling the country working music festivals and dog sitting while pushing my art business, but now I’m in Southern California and meeting brilliant minds that might want to help me create this show. 

Again, I love writing and find myself proud just to complete a personal project. 

While this should lift my confidence, I’m surrounded by people that say “it’s impossible.” I’m about to embark on 2 weeks of holiday time with some of these unmotivating individuals. I love the “you can do it” people so I’ve been researching inspiring stories of people that found success doing it their own way. 

The obvious ones are JK Rowling, Sylvester Stallone, Dr Seuss, etc. Any others you suggest researching and learning about?

Also, any other struggling/inspired writers out there looking to chat? Or dare I ask, any successful individuals looking to take a chance on an internet stranger? 

(Whew, thanks for reading! 😁)"
