"Explore Tennessee from Nashville, US or fly to some other city?",singka93,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/192jxx4/explore_tennessee_from_nashville_us_or_fly_to/,9,1,"Hi,

We are a couple from Europe and would be flying to Nashville in the second week of April for a conference. This is our second trip to the US. We did an East Coast Trip earlier (NYC, Washington D.C., Philadelphia and Miami). We plan to stay in Nashville for a week and then we have a week free.

Disclaimer: We are both aware of all the top destinations in the US and not much about most of the US, so sorry if I sound ignorant. We are open to new experiences! No particular interest!

Is it worth it to spend our second week in Tennessee and explore it by car? Is rental car affordable in the State? Are there any recommended good hikes, national parks, sightseeing, etc. in the State?

Or would it worthwhile to fly somewhere to a city? I can see Chicago or New Orleans as a probable option.

Any kind of advice/recommendation is welcome. Thanks in advance!"
