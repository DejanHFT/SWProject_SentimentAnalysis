Wife needs motivation...,THE_ETERNAL_ANALBEAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2jitxr/wife_needs_motivation/,20,1,"My wife are out of shape and we decided it was time to stop being slobs, and start getting fit. I am showing results fairly quickly (after about 8 weeks) of daily cardio/light weight reps. This gets her to feel de-motivated by her lack of results (I hear it is harder for females to lose body fat, I don't know if that's true). Anyways, getting desperate that she won't quit on me, I bought her Hydroxycut. Today is her first day on it. Did I do the right thing? Help me, Fittit!"
