I recommended a stranger a book and they got it!,Kangaroofact,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l49wjz/i_recommended_a_stranger_a_book_and_they_got_it/,229,3807,"I  was listening to an employee and some random customer at a Barnes and Nobles. They mentioned a series I had read so I stepped forward to recommend the lightbringer series (which is an amazing dark political fantasy book by Brent Weeks). Anyways, about 10 minutes later customer comes back to grab the book. Just felt nice for someone to grab a book I love so much that they hopefully can too."
