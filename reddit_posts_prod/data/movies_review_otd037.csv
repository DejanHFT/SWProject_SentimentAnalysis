'The Suicide Squad' Review Thread,SanderSo47,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/otd037/the_suicide_squad_review_thread/,1636,3211,"[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_suicide_squad): 99% (68 reviews) with 8.10 in average rating

> Critics consensus: Enlivened by writer-director James Gunn's singularly skewed vision, The Suicide Squad marks a funny, fast-paced rebound that plays to the source material's violent, anarchic strengths.

[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-suicide-squad): 78/100 (24 reviews)

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie.

> Not only does it find the nastily enjoyable vibe that eluded its predecessor, but it also tells a story worth following — while balancing its most appealing character with others whose disposability (they aren’t sent on suicide missions for nothin’) doesn’t prevent them from being good company onscreen. Bonus: Unlike Ayer, Gunn never looks at Robbie as if he’s hoping for a lap dance.

-[John DeFore, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-suicide-squad-1234989192/)

> “The Suicide Squad,” make no mistake, is a grand-scaled down-and-dirty throwaway. James Gunn has directed it like a bad boy, though that was his mandate. In fulfilling it, he’s proven himself to be a good boy (which is why he was rehired by Disney for “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3”). But he knows how to dip into the gutter with style.

-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/the-suicide-squad-review-idris-elba-margot-robbie-james-gunn-1235028666/)

> If the movies are killing themselves with superhero overload, at least “The Suicide Squad” suggests the medium will go down laughing.

-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2021/07/the-suicide-squad-review-james-gunn-1234653947/): B+

> James Gunn absolutely kills it with The Suicide Squad. The film is a bloody, chaotic ride from start to finish that finally does justice to Task Force X. It’s endlessly shocking and funny, and its showcase of F-list DC villains is nothing short of brilliant.

-[Joshua Yehl, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-suicide-squad-review): 9.0 ""amazing""

> Gunn’s first “Guardians” was where Marvel proved it could make a big swing pay off with obscure characters. In a way, ""The Suicide Squad"" is the anti-Marvel movie: Yes, it lays groundwork for other projects but one never knows if a favorite character's going to have a crashing helicopter land on them. You don't see this many people die in a ""John Wick"" installment, much less a superhero film. 

-[Brian Truitt, USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/07/28/the-suicide-squad-review-james-gunn-blows-up-superhero-movie/5395979001/): 3.5/4

> The result is a film that’s both refreshing, exhilarating, and a darkly-comic blast that will make you want to see these characters come back for more, assuming they survive.

-[Matt Goldberg, Collider](https://collider.com/the-suicide-squad-review-james-gunn/): A-

> Not everything works here, but the sheer crazy confidence-through-chaos of the Suicide Squad and their bizarrely dysfunctional MO makes for a mighty spectacle.

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/28/the-suicide-squad-review-eyeball-blitzing-supervillain-reboot): 3/5

> After that thrilling opening act, The Suicide Squad settles down into a more conventional (if still satisfying) superhero adventure. The story flags a little, and some tricky editing in the final act designed to keep up the energy just makes the climax more confusing. Still, the opening is a blast — and the whole thing looks like a Fellini movie compared to Suicide Squad. 

-[Matt Singer, Screen Crush](https://screencrush.com/the-suicide-squad-review/): 7/10

> Whatever their political bent, viewers dealing with superhero fatigue might well find some respite in “The Suicide Squad,” a film that’s trying to push against the edges of these audience-friendly sagas with storytelling that’s at least slightly different and daring. On the James Gunn scale, it feels like a happy medium between the all-ages workplace comedy of the “Guardians” movies and the snarky misanthropy of his heroic satire “Super.” As other superhero franchises begin to hit the narrative wall, “The Suicide Squad” promises to find new and unexpected places to go, should this team live to die again.

-[Alonso Duralde, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/the-suicide-squad-film-review-margot-robbie-idris-elba/)

> The script, accordingly, herks and jerks along with a sort of forced-festive glee, its mounting body count buffeted by goofball banter and pounding soundtrack cues. A good half of the jokes don't land, but unlike his predecessor's joyless slog, Gunn's version at least celebrates the nonsense.

-[Leah Greenblatt, Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-suicide-squad-review-james-gunn/): C+

> We totally get if you've approached the release of The Suicide Squad with some trepidation as we felt the same, especially in the wake of the previous version. But you won't be thinking that within minutes of stepping into James Gunn's take on this world. Not everything will work for you and that's fine because it's exactly what we want from a blockbuster: a genuinely unique movie that's the product of a filmmaker, rather than a committee. And it also helps that The Suicide Squad is also just so entertaining as a result.

-[Ian Sandwell, Digital Spy](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a36963859/the-suicide-squad-review/): 4/5

> Watching Gunn's version you find yourself looking back on the original and thinking, 'ohhhh, so this is what they were trying to do'. The film's playlist isn't as showy as Guardians of the Galaxy's much-loved soundtracks, but provide yet another pleasure in this tour de force of trash. The Suicide Squad is demented and delicious, heartfelt and horribly hilarious. 

-[Richard Trenholm, CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/the-suicide-squad-review-a-gory-glorious-deranged-dc-delight/)

> Because the overarching story is so streamlined, Gunn has fun wrong-footing us with tricky time shifts and an amusing romantic subplot involving Robbie’s Harley Quinn, who’s still a bundle of fun to watch. A few characters including Peter Capaldi’s underwritten antagonist The Thinker don’t shine as brightly, but that’s a pretty minor complaint. Bold, boisterous and only schmaltzy right at its climax, The Suicide Squad proves you can spend time with the bad guys without regretting it afterwards.

-[Nick Levine, NME](https://www.nme.com/reviews/film-reviews/the-suicide-squad-review-james-gunn-3005085): 4/5

> At times, The Suicide Squad feels less like a movie than a mission statement from a director. Behold, look what I can do with a budget and all the comic book characters I can play with. But, the unexpected heart at the center of the film, a sneaky anti-imperialist bent, and Gunn’s wild visual leaps make The Suicide Squad a bloody, gory delight.

-[Hoai-Tran Bui, /FILM](https://www.slashfilm.com/the-suicide-squad-review-james-gunn-serves-a-splatter-filled-superhero-romp-with-a-sprinkling-of-sweetness/): 8.5/10

> Ultimately, “The Suicide Squad” is a tale of beautiful losers discovering their humanity in a brief, inspired moment of convergence, finding hard-fought salvation in each other and the notion that all of us are always worthy of dignity.

-[Rodrigo Perez, The Playlist](https://theplaylist.net/the-suicide-squad-james-gunn-inspires-the-dc-universe-review-20210728/): B+

> Task Force X has the X factor in James Gunn’s lively, funny, and very bloody improvement on a DC disappointment.

-[Neil Smith, Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-suicide-squad-review/): 4/5
