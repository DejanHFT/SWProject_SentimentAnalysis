"What game were you super excited to play, but disappointed once you finally got to?",finnjakefionnacake,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/13qpejf/what_game_were_you_super_excited_to_play_but/,470,56,"Doesn't necessarily have to be something that was a new release. Just anything you were super hyped to finally get your hands on, but let down by the experience of playing it. And why?

For me, it might have been Mass Effect: Andromeda. I played the Mass Effect series way after it came out (in like 2020) and had not heard much about Andromeda. I was very excited to get to the final game in the series at the time -- and I actually didn't end up hating it, but it just didn't at all match up to the experience of the previous 3 games and I found myself quickly disappointed getting through it.
