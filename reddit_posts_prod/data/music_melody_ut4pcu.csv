Is there a word for when a song repeats the same melody (hopefully the right word) over and over but with every iteration it adds something new to it?,JDandthepickodestiny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/ut4pcu/is_there_a_word_for_when_a_song_repeats_the_same/,68,61,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this. The only example I can think of at the moment is the transition between first and second halves of ""One"" by Metallica but I'm sure there are better examples. 

I just wanted to know what its called so I can find more songs with it

EDIT: Thank you for all the replies guys. I'm excited to listen to all of these."
