Frosting large acrylic panel,Vilhelm_,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/14rpwns/frosting_large_acrylic_panel/,3,1,"Hey guys! 

I work at what is basically a type of student organization (Google nations in Lund if you're curious exactly what I'm talking about) and we recently started a project to build a new DJ-booth. The plan as it currently stands is to have the facade of the booth be frosted acrylic panels, and while doing some research I stumbled upon using acetone to achieve this effect. The method would in that case be to use a spray can with acetone on the acrylic to get as even a coat as possible. Unfortunately, sandblasting is not an option. 

Does anyone here have any experience with frosting acrylic using acetone or any other method? Would it be easier alltogether to use a frosting spray? Is it even a feasible idea to use this material in the given application to begin with? Custom ordering pieces is possible, but obviously more expensive than DIYing it. 

I'll make sure to post some pictures when it's all done!"
