I think I've discovered the best way to eat tuna (as well as the perfect fitness snack).,atromic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/t476s/i_think_ive_discovered_the_best_way_to_eat_tuna/,253,286,"1 Whole can of tuna, 1 whole avocado, 1/2 cup full fat cottage cheese, cholula chipotle hot sauce, pepper.  Mash it all together and it's like eating a bowl of guacamole.


About 500 calories, 40g protein, 9g net carbs, 10g fiber. Takes about 2 minutes to prepare.


EDIT: Lots of people are commenting on the mercury levels in tuna.  For starters, I eat chunk lite, which is cheaper, slightly higher in protein/can, and contains less mercury than albacore. According to [CDC guidelines](http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp.asp?id=115&tid=24) your body can safely process and store the mercury from a can a day.  They put the maximum recommended intake from tuna at 2.2lbs/week (about 6 cans a week). I think I'm ok at 3-5 cans.



>""No consumption advice is necessary for the top ten seafood species that make up about 80% of the seafood sold in the United States: canned tuna, shrimp, pollock, salmon, cod, catfish, clams, flatfish, crabs, and scallops. The methylmercury in these species is generally less than 0.2 ppm, and few people eat more than the suggested weekly limit of fish (i.e., 2.2 pounds)."" -CDC
