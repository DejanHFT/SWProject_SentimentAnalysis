Looking for a strategy game reccomendation,SSD_Misanu,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/x430jf/looking_for_a_strategy_game_reccomendation/,19,0,"Hey everyone,

I'm looking for a good strategy game to play, but I've always been put off by the seemingly massive learning curve that's required in order to get into one. I've tried getting into Civ6 and Stellaris before but my brain turns off after about an hour of tutorials. 

Is there a relatively simpler strategy game that exists? Do you have any recommendations? 

Turn based is ideal. I love XCOM and Darkest Dungeon but am looking for a game thats more like Civilisation (city building, research etc maybe?)

Pretty flexible, would love to hear some suggestions :)

Thank you!"
