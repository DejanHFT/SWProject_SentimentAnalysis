Are most advancements in AI from better hardware or more advanced formulae?,Cranyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/49w1rr/are_most_advancements_in_ai_from_better_hardware/,10,19,"Theoretically, a computer could brute force a problem to figure out every possible optimal solution, but that is absurdly infeasible in most instances, so systems use tricks such as classifiers and error minimization to get a ""best guess."" 

When new milestones such as Deepmind's recent victories are reached, is this more due to faster processors allowing for deeper/wider searches with existing algorithms, or have the algorithms themselves improved? (I'm sure it's a little of column A and a little of column B, buy I'm asking for a little more specific than that)"
