"[NSWF maybe] How can I (25F) be supportive of him (29M) when he's self-sabotaging relationship over his ""small"" penis?",throwmeaway71517,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6nhm0p/nswf_maybe_how_can_i_25f_be_supportive_of_him_29m/,55,80,"(Saw another thread about penis size in here. Must be something going around.)

Dating this guy and he is very insecure about his ""small"" penis. I'm using ""s because he's not small, just average. His perception of himself is way off base. 

He brings it up all the time. Things like ""Are you sure you want me and my tiny cock?"" Something like this is said at least once a day. He's preoccupied with it. I've never brought it up, and quite frankly his size is something I never would have thought about if he wouldn't have brought it up in the first place. 

I've reassured him countless times that I don't think he's small, he's given me the best orgasms I ever had, that kind of thing. Which is the truth. He insists I'm lying. 

A few days ago, we got to talking about my ex BF. He asked me if he was big. I told him the truth: 9"". He flipped out and said he would never be able to please me like my ex could. I, again, told him how the best sex I've ever had has been with him, not my ex, and that he was the only one I wanted. He told me he ""couldn't deal with this"" and he needed a break. 

I kept my cool and told him ok, I'd be around when he was ready. 

He's a great guy but has some major issues and insecurities. ...Insecurities and issues that probably need to be worked out in therapy. 

I realize there's only so much I can do, but does anyone have any ideas for being supportive? Right now, I'm just giving him his space as he requested so I don't smother him. 

Tl;dr Him: preoccupied with feeling inadequate due to dick size despite me reassuring him that he's great. Me: not sure what to do anymore. "
