"If we have the human genome mapped, do we know what each gene does?",YandelV,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/15sl8i7/if_we_have_the_human_genome_mapped_do_we_know/,44,53,"I am curious about gene editing and technology behind it, and to see it’s full potential in all fields of what could be. Most stuff I find about it online confuses me

1) if we have the human genome mapped, does this mean we know what each gene does and all of the functions of each and every gene?  If not, then what did completing human genome even mean?  is it possible to learn them all now ?

2) can gene therapy such as crispr still be successful and safe without knowing all of the things listed above? 



3) when will gene editing technologies such as Crispr be mainstream, widely available and for anything genetic disease, autoimmune, allergies, cancer or no matter how mild [benign skin condition such as keratosis pilaris ]or for something very serious, where it is easily curable and accessible to almost all? 

4) when will gene editing be available for those who wish to do things such as anti aging, reverse gray hair, change eye color, and make adults even taller [this would be a huge opportunity and industry as humans are very vain] as well as fixing things such as bad muscle insertions, and muscle asymmetry etc which is purely genetic and there is currently no treatment for. Could it even replace plastic surgery?

5) how much do you guys see software such as AI [NOT chatGPT] but legit ones used by medical institutions to revolutionize and speed up crispr, identifying gene functions, and curing things? 5 years sooner? 10 years? A year?"
