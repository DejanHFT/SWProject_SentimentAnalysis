"Am I the only person who watch movie for enjoyment, rather than critiquing minor details which doesn't distract me?",ThisIsTeAccont,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2474bt/am_i_the_only_person_who_watch_movie_for/,13,0,"I'm not sure, but a lot of people seem to watch movies just to judge, not watch for entertainment's sake. Of course if a movie is just so bad that it deserves one, maybe even then I'll hate it too. But quite a few movies don't have big issues that irks me in any way, and I'll just enjoy it after a day's work to relax.

One recent movies like Divergent (To clarify, I am not a Divergent fangirl and have not yet seen the books too), Oblivion or heck even movies like Paranormal Activity series, yeah maybe the acting is bad, or the dialogues are cheesy, but if you just sit back, watch for your enjoyment, and gets at least some of it, then it is good and does what a movie ultimately is supposed to do.

Maybe someone else wo disagrees can change my view?"
