What is your favorite historically accurate movie about a historical event?,seekTRUTH33boldly,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/twnp9q/what_is_your_favorite_historically_accurate_movie/,64,30,"My favorite historically accurate movie based on a historical event is, and always will be, called ""the Day of the Siege"" about the Battle of Vienna that is about several countries working together to try to stop the Muslims from invading the Golden Apple.  It is my understanding that most of the fleets that fight the Muslims are Catholics, but correct me if I am wrong, please and thank you.               The battle was on September 12th 1683. There are dilemmas between the countries at the time and the movie portrays the situations quite well.

Of course, if you know the basics of this battle, you'd know how Poland played a crucial role in this battle.  Sabaton's song ""The Winged Hussars"" depicts this perfectly.

This movie has a special place in my heart b/c I was born in Poland. :D    I myself have watched this movie 4 times since mid 2019 or so.
