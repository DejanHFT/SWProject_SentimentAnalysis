"Come on, guys.  Let's give some real tips to help with everyday motivation for working out and staying healthy.  I'll go first.",WordyNinja,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/e79yy/come_on_guys_lets_give_some_real_tips_to_help/,83,68,"So I've noticed more than once that someone has posted asking Fittit for help or tips in staying motivated everyday to workout and/or be healthy and the top voted comments are usually something like ""Just get off your fat ass and do it!"" or ""Train for the zombie apocalypse!!""  while the actually useful tips stay at the bottom with lower upvotes.  Fuck that.  Here are things that I've found work for me, personally.  Enjoy:

* Make a point to work out on Monday.  It sets the tone for the week. \
* Find the time of day that fits best in your average schedule to work out and keep working out at the time on your workout days.  After a while, it gets to be ""Oh, it's almost 6 o'clock, got to get ready for my run.""
* Some people like workout buddies, some don't - figure out which one you are. I love working out alone and it's become my daily meditation. I end up really looking forward to getting some alone time everyday.  
* Sign up for a race and tell all your friends and family about it.  Nothing's more motivating that hearing ""how's the training for that 10K going?""  
* If you're having trouble getting the motivation to work out right then and there, just change into your workout clothes.  It's surprisingly tough to lounge around in the stuff you normally only wear to work out.
* If you're really having trouble getting out the door, make a deal with yourself to just do a light workout for at least 30 minutes. A lot of times, once I'm out there or make it to the gym I find the motivation to push it to a full-on intense workout. 
* Take it one day at time.  An unhealthy lifestyle is addictive, so treat it like an addiction.  As soon as you wake up, set out to eat healthy and work out just for that day.  After a while, it'll become second nature and you can expand it into large goals like ""I'm going to work out everyday this week"" or ""I'm going to train for the next six months to run a marathon.""
* Join a fun cool activity or sport that you can do once a week like rock climbing, dodge ball, or ultimate frisbee. 
* Get a Sigg bottle, Kleen Kanteen, or a Nalgene and use it to drink water all day.  Just keep filling it up at the office water cooler and at home with the Brita jug.  It keeps you from eating out of boredom and hydrated so you can just go straight from what you're doing to the gym.  


What do you guys got? "
