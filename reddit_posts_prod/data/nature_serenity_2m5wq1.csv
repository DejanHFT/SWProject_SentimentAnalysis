Have you guys ever noticed...,Sierrae1994,https://www.reddit.com/r/nature/comments/2m5wq1/have_you_guys_ever_noticed/,5,44,"Have you guys ever noticed that when it gets really cold the wind blows through the leaves in a certain way that when you stop and listen to it, it sounds like there is nothing but emptiness outside of your house. To me its actually kind of relaxing because it feels very serene and i could just sit there and listen to the sounds of nature for hours."
