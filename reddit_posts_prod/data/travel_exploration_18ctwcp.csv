24 hour layover in Shenzhen - Can I explore? 144h visa?,jasekiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18ctwcp/24_hour_layover_in_shenzhen_can_i_explore_144h/,5,7,"Hi everyone

&#x200B;

I am (Australian national) looking at flights to Bangkok but there is nothing cheap at the moment - the only reasonable flight has a 24h layover in Shenzhen. However, I don't want to stay at the airport for 23h 50 minutes as that is grim. Does anyone here have any experience with using the 144h visa? How do I apply and would I be able to explore Shenzhen city?

Thanks so much"
