Copying vs Inspiration for my stories. HELP!!!,spartanba,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/ji5cxm/copying_vs_inspiration_for_my_stories_help/,20,16,"Hey. I'm 16 and I've been recently creating stories and I'm very interested in making them into books sometime down the line. In my story, I have one clan that uses life-like shadows to attack enemies and can switch positions with them. I got heavy inspiration about this from the online game League of Legends where a character named Zed, has very similar abilities, but my story has completely different characters, plotline,s, and narration. I was wondering if I was straight-up copying or I was just inspiration. Thank you in advance for answering"
