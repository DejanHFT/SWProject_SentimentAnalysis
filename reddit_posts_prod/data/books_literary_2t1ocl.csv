What's your literary guilty pleasure?,probably_not_serious,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2t1ocl/whats_your_literary_guilty_pleasure/,132,36,"Greetings my fellow book nerds. I am a guy who was recently re-reading The Host the other day (in defense, I read this book long before the Twilight movies came out) and lied when someone asked me what I was reading. That got me wondering what kind of books other people like to read that they wouldn't necessarily admit to in public. 

Looking past the whole, ""don't be ashamed of reading something you enjoy"" thing, what is your literary guilty pleasure?"
