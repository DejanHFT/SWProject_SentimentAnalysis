"What tastes terrible when eaten alone, but delicious with other ingredients?",ShiftAndWitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/3v5qbg/what_tastes_terrible_when_eaten_alone_but/,806,446,"Just tried Vegemite for the first time by itself and gagged. I live in Banff, Alberta and the large Australian community here has been mentioning it a lot so I gave it a try. It's a pretty strong paste that should never touch your tongue by its lonesome but pretty tasty on toast and butter. What other example are there of this?"
