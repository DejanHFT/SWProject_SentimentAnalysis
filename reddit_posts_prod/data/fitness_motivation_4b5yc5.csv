"2 1/2 months of hard work, minimal progress, bloated and losing motivation. prefect.",givemeallthenoms,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4b5yc5/2_12_months_of_hard_work_minimal_progress_bloated/,43,39,"Hi all, 


Oh look, just another dumbass complaining about not losing the last stubborn pounds. Well help me pretty please. I'll make it concise and sweet. Im not new to being active (I have been since I was a kid) nor to working out. Last summer I got to my highest weight, 155 pounds. June to November '15 I lost 15 pounds. Then I ate whatever in December and started a cut in January. So far lost about, oh let's see, 0 pounds. Let me break it down bc I have absolutely no clue what I am doing wrong.



Stats: of the female population, 5'6"", 140 pounds. I took a body fat test at a clinic with one of those handheld monitor devices and it said 25.5% - don't know how accurate that is.


Workout: I workout 5 to 6 times a week. 


* I have stuck to one training program for 5 weeks. Now I have a new training program for about 3-4 weeks now. I was told by a PT at my gym to keep my rep range b/w 12-15 reps (3/4 sets). I have an active job too, on my feet for 6 or 7 hours at a time walking.


The split is as follows: 

* Mo: Back/biceps + quick HIIT session
 
* Tu: Hammstrings 

* Wed: Cardio only (steady state) 

* Th: Buns + Quads 

* Fri: Shoulders/Triceps

* Sat: Chest + a combo of HIIT + steady state cardio (sometimes I'm not too good at doing cardio on this day) + resistance bands bun workout.
*** I know I don't train abs, I just hate individually training them - but that's no excuse.


Macros/noms: acc. to the internets my 20% of my TDEE is 1800 cals (180C, 70F, 115P acc. to MFP). Here's an example of my day in food: 

* Breakast: 1 cup of oatmeal with berries and 1 tbsp peanut butter + 1/4cup soy milk. 

* Post workout: chocolate milk 12oz 

* Lunch: 4oz Fish/chicken/turkey (whichever) + veggies 

* Snack 2: Almonds/walnuts (hefty snack of 300 cals) or protein bar 

* Dinner: Meat or eggs with veggies + toast with avocado spread + tomatoes 

* Snack 3: yogurt + granola or some sort of fruit or i don't have a 3rd snack. 

* Cheating once a week. (and I go ham y'all, no holding back - yes, I need to change this)

* Worth mentioning I am bloated OFTEN. I try to drink as much water as I can. I feel like I retain water like a sponge.


So far, I see very little difference. It seems as though I have a layer of fat covering all the goods and I just can't get rid of it, especially my lower belly. I want to cut down, goal weight is 135-130 pounds and have visibly defined arms, belly, back - all the parts. I got so down today I ate all my feelings. I've had major body issues in the past and this no progress thing is making me lose all motivation. **My Q's**: am I eating enough/too much? hows the routine looking? what can I do? Maybe I'm just overthinking and am  impatient. It's just that for how much work *I feel* (I might be off) I put in the progress is painfully slow. Tell me whatever you think it will help. Show me the light r/fitness!

**TO ADD**: I am definitely not expecting a banging body overnight. I just wanna know if I am onto something good here or I need to change things.


EDIT: Thank you for the advice everyone! I shall apply it :)"
