Help? Minimum full body daily workouts to achieve muscle gain?,VigilantSmartbomb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8w2591/help_minimum_full_body_daily_workouts_to_achieve/,14,5,"For example I think like 10 push-ups is the minimum you have to do daily to achieve gradual muscle gain and not atrophy(?). 

I just wanna find a quick routine that could guide me through a full body workout that meets the minimum requirements to stop muscle mass decline. 

I hope this makes sense, I’m sorry if this is a common question. I just realize I need to start somewhere and a routine could be it. 

Edit: or even a list of workouts to do would be helpful!! Thanks y’all

Edit: I’m in decent shape already, I was an athlete most my life. I guess to clarify- I’m looking for the scientific minimums that are usually taught in personal trainer training programs. That’s how I learned about the 10 push ups a day thing. "
