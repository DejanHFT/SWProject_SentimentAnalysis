Strategy Game Recomendations,Chicken_Sendies,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/vnqk5i/strategy_game_recomendations/,6,1,"One of my favourite games by far on PC is Civ 6. its my most played on steam and, while i still enjoy it, i would love to try some other games with a similar feel. 

I tried out humankind and hearts of iron on game pass and i wasnt a big fan of either. Humankind just made me miss Civ and hearts of iron was a bit too fast paced for my liking (not sure if all rts games are like this, but i prefer to have the time to think and plan). also tried crusader kings adn found it was just a little too intimidatingly complex.

Hopefully you guys can recommend some games that are like civ where you use war and politics to grow an empire and become more powerful. I'm also a bit of a history buff, so any game based on history will probably catch my attention... maybe i should try hearts of iron again. Anyway, i've heard total war three kingdsoms and europa universalis are good but ive never played."
