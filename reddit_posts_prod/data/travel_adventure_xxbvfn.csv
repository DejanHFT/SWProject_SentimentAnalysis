Remote work+ parenting+ travel = Adventure?,otistheleonis,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/xxbvfn/remote_work_parenting_travel_adventure/,4,0,"I recently landed a new job that is flexible, 100% remote, and pays enough to cover our basic expenses. My spouse and I are considering spending a ""season"" (1-4 months?) somewhere else in the world while I work remotely. But where should we go?  


Pertinent details:  
\- We have an easygoing six-month-old  
\- We are currently on Pacific Standard Time, and I would prefer to stay within a two hour time change in either direction for work scheduling purposes (or, I guess, a 22-26 hour change).  
\- We enjoy outdoor adventuring: climbing, hiking, swimming, SUPing, mountain biking, etc. Awesome nature is a must wherever we go.  
\- Ideally we would be away for a summer, since that is our least favorite season at home.  
\- Rustic is fine, but I need reliable internet.  
\- We are both good travelers, and comfortable with culture shock, language barriers, etc.  


Right now we are considering Costa Rica, Alaska, British Columbia, Mexico. But I know there are awesome places we haven't thought of yet!  
Any suggestions, tips, resources, etc. are welcome!"
