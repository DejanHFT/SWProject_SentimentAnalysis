Looking for Fitzcarraldo critiques/reviews,martinsq29,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/rtp1ht/looking_for_fitzcarraldo_critiquesreviews/,20,6,"I've seen the movie and I'm absolutely dumbfounded as to what would be its significance as a piece of art. Don't get me wrong, I see some of its selling points and a couple of moments were so grandiose I almost felt like they outweighed the whole rest of the movie. But overall it felt pretentious, redundant and devoid of meaning. Absurd in all of the worst ways, not only as a caricature of Fitz's character.

I'm surely missing many aspects of it, so I'm asking you to share any good bibliography on the movie as an art piece. Thanks in advance"
