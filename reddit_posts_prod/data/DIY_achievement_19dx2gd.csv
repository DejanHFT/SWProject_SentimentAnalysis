Looking for a simple and cheap solution to the lack of fire surround,FREEMANICDALEK,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/19dx2gd,2,1,I live in a rental property that has this fireplace in the livingroom. The fireplace isn’t used as we have central heating. I’ve been trying to figure out an easy and aesthetically more pleasing fix but am completely uninspired as to how to achieve it 🙁 Heeeelp!
