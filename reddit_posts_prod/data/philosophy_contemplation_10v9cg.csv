What are the practical differences between ethical egoism and amoralism?,ThisRedditorIsDrunk,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/10v9cg/what_are_the_practical_differences_between/,16,7,"Often, here on /r/philosophy, I find a few who would describe themselves as moral nihilists or amoralists. And to be honest, I often find this suspicious. It seems to me that these categories are purely theoretical and have no practical merit. Considering the nihilist redditor, we can assume that this individual behaves morally to the expectations of their social environment to be able to have an internet connection as well as be a member of this site's community up to that point unbanned. 

But what is the behavior that we ascribe to those who *behave* amorally? Typically, it's some kind of hedonism or, at the very least, egoism. However, these are real schools of thought in ethics which outline what they assert is intrinsically good, pleasure and self-interest respectively. 

In fact, the *only* difference I can find is entirely theoretical and solely concerned with normativity. An hedonist would proudly proclaim that pleasure is the highest good which all people should seek but an hedonistic amoralist would not make such a claim as they would deny the possibility of any good. Yet this makes no practical difference! A self-described nihilist can be a world-renown philanthropist or a homeless heroin addict, just as long as he takes this single theoretical position. They can say, ""Well there are no ethical truths so do whatever,"" but they'll still need to contemplate for themselves what it is they should pursue if they're going to do anything at all. In fact, the lesson of existentialism is that this realization only makes morality *much more* imperative.

Perhaps I, myself, am such a thorough-going amoralist that I want to scrap this concern with universalism in ethics and collapse it all back to the practical. It's not the school of thought one identifies as on an internet forum but what one *does* that determines one's moral beliefs. 

Agree? Disagree? Think I'm a fucking moron too full of shit to worth responding to? "
