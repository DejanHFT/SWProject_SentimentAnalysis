Inquiry Based Learning,vegetasayanlevel6,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/cma56a/inquiry_based_learning/,28,54,"I teach STEM and computer science courses. For a long time, I had been following traditional pedagogy techniques with varied results. Last year I started experimenting with Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) and was astound by the improvement in higher order thinking and curiosity level of students. 

Now I'm planning to make it accessible to a larger section of people by reducing human intervention and making it available online. Would love to brain storm on the framework with people interested and experienced in this domain. 

Hit me up if you would like to have a small discussion. 

 Cheers."
