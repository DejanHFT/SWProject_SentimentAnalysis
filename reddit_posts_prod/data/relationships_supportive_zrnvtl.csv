I (30f) try to be supportive but he (32m) keeps making demands that I find unreasonable and then we fight,Ok-Beautiful5700,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zrnvtl/i_30f_try_to_be_supportive_but_he_32m_keeps/,76,29,"I am finding it all very tiring at this point. I don't live with him (I live about 20 minutes away). We have been together for 4 years. I generally stay there on the weekends.

He was working full time and things were better then (although he still would come up with a lot of demands...but not as frequently). But as of September he's gone back to school. It's a heavy workload for a demanding degree, and he finds it a lot of work. I'm happy for him, I'm supportive, I help him when I can, but also it's 100% his choice to go back to school (and yes, it means he will struggle financially and with time and projects for the next 3 years).

He has ADHD (medicated) and I don't know if it is directly related, but he takes much longer than everyone else to get anything done. He has accommodations through school, but he still takes very long to complete assignments and projects. Because of ADHD I guess, he also struggles to do anything if I'm not sitting there with him. Which doesn't really work for me. Even if we lived together (which we have at points) I am very introverted and I cannot just *BE* with someone 24/7. I start to go loopy.

He is currently working on an assignment that was due days ago. He has spent several days working on it (keep in mind he's spending many days longer than everyone else). During these days, I go there and putter around, tidy up a bit, watch movies while he works. He's always pouty when I leave (I have other things that I need to do...namely Christmas shopping and I have several events that I've had to go to). He always suggests he doesn't really work much when I'm not there, putting the onus on me to stay (for HOURS) or he ""can't work"". I do understand ADHD (I don't have it myself) but I've made suggestions for other ways he can work (for example, at times I've been on video with him....I am doing what I need and he's working; other times I check in with him via phone or text regularly; I've even suggested that he hire someone simply to sit with him and keep him accountable to working).

Like clockwork, he's now mad at me. Even though I spent hours and hours with him trying to help (clean his house, look after errands for him, decorate his house for Christmas, proofread his drafts). He is completely sleep deprived now (he always gets this way unless I am there keeping him on track) and unreasonable. I was there for 8 hours yesterday and had to leave to go to an event last night. Last last night he was texting me asking me to come back over at 6am. I don't **want** to. I said I have a few errands to run and I'd be there by noon. Then he gets FURIOUS. Suddenly he's telling me I don't help him with anything (that one really irritates me...I help him more than every other person he knows put together). I don't care about him. On and on.

In this brief space, I haven't expressed it but I do love him and want to stay together. But this happens all the time (now that he's in school....I'm not sure if it's just growing pains of getting used to being in school again or if this will be my life for years). But I don't know what to do to side-step all these unreasonable demands on my time without ending up in a big argument on a very very regular basis. Any ideas?

tldr: bf wants me there constantly because he feels he can't do his work without me...I can't be there all the time (nor would I want to be) and we are fighting a LOT because of it."
