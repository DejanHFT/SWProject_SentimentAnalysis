This all-you-can-drink gaming bar just opened in Bangkok yesterday. I’m so excited.,shakensparco,https://i.redd.it/6vrvyyj0ub5c1.jpg,301,6820,"It’s 2:30 a.m. in Bangkok (3:09 a.m. as of writing) and I’m walking out of a Kareoke bar dressed as Santa. Suddenly, next door, I see this place. They have no customers but did have a crap ton of NES, SNES N64, Wii U, PS4, Switch, and board games… $11.22 for the first hour and $4.21 for each successive a half hour…. And my friends keep asking when I’m moving back to America…

They didn’t ask me to promote this, I just want a local gamer bar to succeed."
