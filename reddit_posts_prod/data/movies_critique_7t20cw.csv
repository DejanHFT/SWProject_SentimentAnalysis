3 Questions on Critiquing Movies (with examples and spoilers),IVChioco,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7t20cw/3_questions_on_critiquing_movies_with_examples/,2,7,"Hi all, I have a couple questions about reviewing movies that I hope ya'll can help me out with. I've always loved watching movies and have recently begun to review movies (on Letterboxd) and watch them a little more critically, but the more I start to review them, the more I realize that I don't really know what I'm doing. I hope these are substantive questions, so if anyone can give me any insight on how to address them, I'd really appreciate it! 


 • **Target Audience vs. Actual Overall Quality:** How should I weigh a film's success at pleasing its target audience against its overall worth? For example, *Stuart Little* (1999) is probably a movie that most 8-year-olds would give 5 stars because it's a movie that's specifically targeted for children. I myself loved *Stuart Little* when I was a kid. However, most adults would probably give it around 2.5-3.5 stars because it's actually not that great of a movie. **I feel like I should give *some* credit to a movie if it was successful with its target audience, but at the same time I feel like I should critique movies as *I* see them—not necessarily how its target audience receives it. How do you all balance these factors?**  


 • **Old Movie Limitations vs. New Movies:** This question is tangentially related to the first question. There are plenty of old movies out there that are and should be considered sublime, but at the same time *perhaps* these movies shouldn't be considered *as good as* today's movies because they didn't—and couldn't (due to technological limitations)—use the full arsenal of movie-making and editing techniques that we have today. For example, nearly everyone considers Melies's [*A Trip to the Moon*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FrdVdKlxUk&t=128s) (1902) to be a good movie, yet we'd also be right to see it as primitive because Melies hardly moved the camera in making his movies, partly because he simply didn't have the technology to move a camera around easily and also because nobody had thought of moving a camera back then. In other words, Melies's camera basically functioned as the static, inert eye of a theater spectator, and thus his use of camera did little to enhance his movies' narrative structure. You also see some poor editing techniques in a lot of old movies. As another example, I was watching the classic *It's a Wonderful Life* (1946) and there's a scene where the camera just makes a quick (but noticeable) cut in between a character's lines (I can't find the clip of it on Youtube). Yet I feel like that type of editing was common back in the 1930s through 1940s. **This is basically a question of old standards vs. new standards. Is this a factor I should even consider at all when critiquing a movie?** (For the record, I *do* consider *A Trip to the Moon* to be a very good movie and *It's a Wonderful Life* to be one of the best movies ever made. I'm just using them as examples.)


 • **How to Critique a Movie When It's Already Been Spoiled for You . . . SPOILERS:** Some movies rely on really big, important moments that just have an impact on the audience. But how should I watch a movie when I already know what happens? I know the best policy is not to spoil a movie for yourself, but . . . I really shot myself in the foot on this one because it's one of the greatest films ever made, but I knew what Alfred Hitchcock's *Vertigo* (1958) was about before I saw it. I love *Vertigo* and I think it's definitely one of the best movies ever made, but at the same time it didn't have quite the same impact on me as it did with lots of other people because I knew going in that Scottie was being duped and that Madeleine was Judy all along. Thus, whereas most people watching *Vertigo* probably wondered why Madeleine was acting all weird in the first half of the film, I knew all along that it was Judy so I took Madeleine's acting as a mere stunt. In other words, I interpreted her actions completely differently than most first-time viewers because I knew what was going to happen, and when the ""Judy to Madeleine"" revelation happened I therefore wasn't surprised like most people. (It's kinda like reading through all 7 Harry Potter books and knowing from the very beginning that Professor Snape is a good guy—you'd interpret his actions in books 1-6 differently, right?) There are a few other movies that I know the plots of even though I haven't seen them (a lot of movies have been spoiled by friends), **but I do feel like I should give those movies—and *Vertigo*—their fair and just treatment when I watch them.**     "
