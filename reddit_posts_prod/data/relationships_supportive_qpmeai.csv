I'm (F22) getting tired of supporting my unemployed BF (M23).,Goldenbruja88,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/qpmeai/im_f22_getting_tired_of_supporting_my_unemployed/,72,62,"I'll try to be short and straight to the point...Me and my boyfriend have been together for 5 years and living together for a year and a half. Background: We were together since highscool. I went to college and he didn't. We spent 2 years long distance until I graduated.  After I graduated, I moved to the city he was staying for us to get our first place. I was able to get a job in my field instantly when I moved (so I wouldn't have to financially depend on him) and he already had a job in retail. We have had our ups and downs but so far things were good till about almost a year ago when he quit his job for being disrespected.

Problem: Since quitting that job, he has had 2 other jobs, both he quit under 2 months for coworker conflicts. He has now not had a job for 4 months and claims there is nothing out there for him that meets what he needs. For the past 2 months I have been paying HIS bills to keep him from missing payments as he has now run out of money. He refuses to work a job that is below a certain pay, not the hours he wants, or seems too stressful. He also sees part time work as a waste of time. He now wants me to apply for jobs for him as he's getting no where. He has now picked up a hobby of MMA and claims he wants to make it a career. I don't agree with this but let him at least have a hobby as he does nothing all day besides that. When the topic of work comes up he gets angry and a conversation goes no where. He doesn't want to go to school as he cannot afford it and really doesn't seem to have many options he's willing to settle for.

He's a sweet guy and I love him very much but it seems long term he might not be reliable. I feel guilty for having these thoughts but it's getting tough to not feel like I'm getting manipulated. It's taking a toll on my attraction to him. I feel like he has no ambition even though he feels bad for not having a job and letting me pay for everything.

We both have a lease together and have a long time till it ends. He has no one to fall back on so I feel bad kicking him out but I'm getting frustrated and exhausted. Should I be patient until he finds a job right for him? If I'm enabling him, what should I do? Am I being shallow for feeling like I can't be with him because of this situation?

TLDR: Boyfriend(23) is unemployed and seems to make no efforts to find a sustainable career. I'm getting exhausted of paying for 2 people. Am I being too harsh?"
