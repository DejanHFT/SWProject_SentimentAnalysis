Suicide ,NaturalChaos,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/uiey7/suicide/,149,123,"There's something profound about the contemplation of suicide. I often wonder why exactly it would matter if someone chose to kill themselves, or why such a big deal is made of it. How exactly is one to say that suicide is a negative when there's no regret from the victim afterwards? Clearly if you're going to seriously consider killing yourself and have the guts to proceed with it, then you're more than likely under circumstances to do so. It's a fairly weak conception to believe that because you're living, there's only one obvious decision, which is to continue living because you feel as if you've in someway been blessed with a certain sense of ""individuality"" which you're committed to. There really is no sense of individuality though, the self is really living in such a close relation with everything else that there really is no differentiation or distinction between the two. The only individuality we have is in regards to a social institution. If there was no society for us to find our part in than we'd have no form of identity whatsoever. How do you explain yourself in terms of yourself. The only way you can explain yourself is in comparison to other people. 

For instance, if you were to live in a society where everyone was an aspiring music artist and who all liked Kraft Dinner macaroni, not only would the society not accomplish anything of any significance, but no one would feel as if they had any sort of individuality or originality in the society they lived in, there would also be a great amount of competition. Or if you lived completely by yourself in the wilderness, you'd never have anybody to compare yourself to, you wouldn't know how well you clicked with another human being or if your personality was ""correct"" by anybodies expectations, but I digress. 

Say for instance you're extremely depressed, you'd just gotten fired from your job and your girlfriend dumped you. There's this massive burden over your shoulders to get your life back on track and meet the predefined standards of living your ancestors before you had shaped and the ones your current peers have modified and solidified. And now you think to yourself, ""Well there's no one I can turn to anymore, this world is cold and brutal, I've been fucked over time and time again, and I really see my life going no where."" Right then and there you pick up the gun, point it at your head and shoot yourself in the face.

What exactly is the significance of that? It's one of the most radical decisions you could possibly make, but there's nothing to be seen or heard afterwards, there's even nothing to think. You would never regret it or think about it, there would be no reflection or sorrow, there wouldn't even be peace or serenity. All those words are descriptions of concepts we feel as a human entity. After you shoot yourself, all there is of yourself anymore is an identifiable lifeless body dead in our reality that eventually decomposes and enriches the soil with nutrients. 

Maybe that's the importance of our lives on an ecological scale, to die and enrich the soil for more plants to grow. 

But anyways, I'm tired and I just wanted to post this up and see what you guys had to say about the concept of suicide. It's always been very interesting to me and I'm sure I'll elaborate upon it more overtime, now what do you think?"
