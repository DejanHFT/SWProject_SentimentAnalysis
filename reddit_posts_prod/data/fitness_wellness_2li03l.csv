Work had a health and wellness fair today....Feel like I haven't made any progress in a year. How do you power through?,punkerdante182,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2li03l/work_had_a_health_and_wellness_fair_todayfeel/,20,6,2 years ago I was 230. I got on keto and lost 50lbs and got down to 180! Then I started working out. I did SL 5x5 bulk and I gain a few so I was back to 195 then 200. After I benched my bodyweight (new years resolution) I decided to start cutting. I donated blood around that time and my heartrate was down to 60! Whoohoo! Then when I started cutting I had no idea how to go about it. Keto you just stayed away from carbs and ate a bunch of fat. Cutting carbs are good? But only some. Fats bad? But not all. The protein side I've finally been getting good at meeting. Work health fair comes up and I find out I'm at 215.....Feels like all of my work has gone to waste. I've been struggling so hard with my nutrition and meeting all my goals everyday but its still not enough.... I work out every other day so 4 day split and I've been doing good there....I just feel like I'm doomed to always be chubby...What can I do to improve? I eat all the right macros I read the wiki.
