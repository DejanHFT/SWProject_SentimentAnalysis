Im in a particularly grumpy mood today so I’m critiquing the worst character of every Christmas movie I see today on the FreeForm channel (North America) today,Jackdidathing,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/kbximt/im_in_a_particularly_grumpy_mood_today_so_im/,5,1,"First up is “The Santa Clause” and for this one it’s Charlie (Scott’s kid if you don’t remember)

1. He’s a brat, he hated his dad until Scott became Santa, granted Scott was a workaholic, but even then Charlie hated his dad until loving him was a benefit to himself

2. Charlie constantly rats out Scott to his class and tells them the inner workings of the company (the North Pole) 

3. Even in court he can’t stop blabbing about how his dad is Santa. He ratted out his dad so he could try to impress the court. 

4. Towards the end he takes credit for the elves work in creating everything on the sleigh. If anything Charlie is an idea man, who gives ideas anybody could have thought of

5. At the very end he fucks up Scott’s route because he wanted to go on a joyride. When he shakes the snow globe he said “the stupid ball isn’t working” and leaves because he didn’t get results in the first 15 seconds. Being a brat as usual

6. At the end he says “I love you Santa Claus” not “dad” he fucking addressed his dad as his job title. Imagine you’re the head of general marketing and your kid said “goodnight head of general marketing, I love you” it would crush anyone I would imagine


Ok now you would think that the Charlie hate would be over now right? Well we still have “The Santa clause 2” where Scott needs to get married (Charlie doesn’t show up too much in the second movie yet he still reigns supreme for worst character so far)

1. At the very beginning of the movie the first scene we see Charlie, he’s older now, and he’s moved on to bigger and better things. Hating his dad again for no apparent reason other than that he doesn’t see him, because he’s always at the North Pole

2. Charlie commits breaking and entering as well as vandalism, this explains why Charlie’s on the naughty list for this movie. He also wrapped his girlfriend into it, making her an accessory to B & E. What’s worse is that Scott blames himself for Charlie’s behavior

3. He oozes that bratty kid behavior, no changes to his character other than age, and juvenile delinquency.

There’s a little break here because my dad needed about 45 minutes of construction help, if I missed anything Charlie did please tell me in the comments

4. Charlie gets angry at Scott for never being there when Scott is meant to be the guy who has the most important business in the world (In the Santa clause cinematic universe) and Charlie blames Scott for his recent juvenile delinquency


I was not around to see “the Santa clause 3: the escape clause” I will make sure to update you tomorrow before 3pm however I have reason to believe Charlie will remain a piece of shit."
