"Well, I finally did my first pullup!",flannel_smoothie,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/407ty5/well_i_finally_did_my_first_pullup/,423,3596,"After 3+ years of trying, i finally was able to do my first pullup!  I have a mild disability called Erb’s Palsy which has given me a 3” difference in arm length.  Being able to finally do this was super important to me.  I've tried to do one about once a week but it's always felt like I was literally tearing my shoulder to pieces.

The biggest help, I think, was learning how to actually activate my lats in the deadlift.  Once I figured out how to do that for stability, I was able to get them more active in the bench, and in variations of rows (lat pull down, seated row, t bar, etc).  I believe that I have always been able to activate the left lat properly but not the right one, which really shows in my physique (and stability on both sides of my body).  Lately I’ve been treating the LPD as a shorter movement and trying to very specifically pull with even force on both sides.  

Generating evenly distributed force is something that’s always been an issue for all of my lifts.  Learning a better activation will hopefully get my bench out of the gutter as well.  I’m heavily incorporating incline bench, slingshot bench and dumbbell bench in my current training cycle to give myself some additional practice while building my lagging stabilizer muscles. Current program: GZCL Jacked & Tan. Previously: Sheiko, Texas Method, Beyond 531, some BulgMet style randomness.

I’m not sure I’ll try these again for a while, they didn’t feel that great and I don’t think they fit into my current programming but it was fun to do once.  If anyone has any questions about training, programming or living feel free to fire away.
