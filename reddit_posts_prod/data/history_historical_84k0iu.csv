Anyone aware of any good historical podcasts?,Solar_Kestrel,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/84k0iu/anyone_aware_of_any_good_historical_podcasts/,177,160,"I’ve decided to try and get into podcasts (yes, I know, I am very late to this party). I’m hoping to be able to find something akin to audio lectures by people who, uh, know what they’re talking about (IE well-researched content by qualified persons). I’ll open to history of any era or region, though I have a special affection for ancient history, and would especially appreciate non-Western history (because, as a Westerner, I’ve had the least exposure to it).

Anyone have any good recommendations?

EDIT: okay, wow, I was not expecting such a deluge! Normally I'd try to individually thank everyone who posted a recommendation, but there are too many of y'all here! So, to everyone who's given me something fun to listen to, **THANK YOU!**"
