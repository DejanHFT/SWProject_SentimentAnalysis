Reddit: What one moment in history would be the most intense and insightful experience and what would your motivations be for witnessing it?,Wildcat190,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1ryfm4/reddit_what_one_moment_in_history_would_be_the/,1,2,"I think about this all the time and phrase it differently every time. There are so many moments that I would have loved to view. Many of them would be desirable for different purposes, be them political or cultural.

One that comes to mind, as an example, would be the meetings during the Cuban Missile Crisis that involved John F. Kennedy and his National Security Council. I think the gravity of this experience would be profound, a culmination of decades of political strife that, if tilted in a slightly different direction, may have led to global catastrophe. Our focus, sadly, is on how close we came to nuclear war. We rarely discuss the implications of the personal vendetta Kennedy maintained against Khrushchev, the multiple options that were considered, and how these men arrived at a quarantine (naval blockade) to combat the tension. I think very rarely has a president been shaken to the degree Kennedy and his administration was at that time and sitting in a corner of those meetings would be a wonderful experience, riveting for the unadulterated perspective of the fear Kennedy and his team experienced that it would offer and critical because of the implications it had moving forward for nuclear weaponry and foreign relations.

I would love to hear all of Reddit's opinion on this. There are so many that would be profound and my perspective is one of a million. I look forward to your responses.
