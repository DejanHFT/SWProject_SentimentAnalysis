"I took inspiration from history's greatest ""villains"", and now my villain is unrealistic.",djmvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/8otidf/i_took_inspiration_from_historys_greatest/,102,109,"I've been working on a low\-fantasy setting where the world is under the occupation of an ""evil empire"". it's tropey, but it's something I'm committed to. So I decided I would make it less tropey by drawing on actual historic ""bad guys"".

It's backfiring.

Here's some examples from history.

Genghis Khan. Murders entire villages if they don't surrender. Piles of bodies.

Ivan the Terrible. Paranoid ruler with a secret police. Executes arbitrarily. Loves to impale.

Hitler. Believes his people are superior, kills everyone else.

Napoleon. Actually seems not bad compared to these other guys. Sneaky. Megalomaniacal.

A bunch of ideological guys ready to justify all kinds of force to create their ""ideal world"".

\*\*\*

When I take one as inspiration, start writing, and sculpt them into my setting... I hit a wall very quickly. I'm like ""this guy is ridiculous. People are going to find this so corny and unbelievable."" I don't mean to make light of actual historical atrocity, because fact is, these guys existed.

But what am I missing? I'm wondering if I'm overthinking it. Or if the key to an evil emperor is less about cruelty and bodycount, in which case, how do I tap into something more emotional/psychological?"
