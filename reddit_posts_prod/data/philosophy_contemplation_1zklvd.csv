"If a society begins to value mediocrity, will it tend towards socialism?",DerGalaxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1zklvd/if_a_society_begins_to_value_mediocrity_will_it/,12,0,"Hi everyone. I was speaking to a friend about the education system (and more specifically whether it should be privatized or not) and we came to the topic of competition and if it drives success in education or not. 

Basically, the idea is that if there is competition, people will have more motivation to do better. I'm not saying this is the case for every person, but I think I am reasonable in saying that the overall majority will follow this trend. So, I mentioned how I think the whole idea of there being ""no losers"" is stupid, and we both agreed that it a mostly capitalist country (like America) competition is a huge factor, in at least its market economy.

We then began to contemplate what society would look like if we valued mediocrity instead of success. My friend says that it will tend towards socialism, because mediocrity would make everyone the same, and thus possibly more socialist. I disagree, because I think mediocrity is a separate factor (ie socialist societies can value success or mediocrity), and I don't think a society that values mediocrity is remotely similar to anything familiar to us. 

I'd appreciate some help on this debate, because I'm feeling a little out of my league here. 

I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this, I think its a larger issue than just economics, or politics, etc. and it will attract more thinkers that can approach this issue from different viewpoints (ones that I can't think of) in a diverse subreddit like this one. Thanks!"
