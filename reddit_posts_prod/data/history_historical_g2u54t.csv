"In Cold war history, shouldn't LBJ's policy to Indonesia received more historical scrutiny?",Anglicanpolitics123,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/g2u54t/in_cold_war_history_shouldnt_lbjs_policy_to/,72,323,"In the 1960s Lyndon Johnson was president in the aftermath of the Kennedy Assassination. He is largely remembered for his support of the Civil Rights movement domestically, and his initiation of the Vietnam War in the history of the Cold War. 

As a result, other areas of Lyndon Johnson's foreign policy as American president during the Cold War have largely gone ignored. One area is Indonesia. Indonesia in the 50s and 60s had a socialist anti-colonial government under the leadership of Sukarno. The United States had tense relations with him and these tensions were exacerbated in the context of the Vietnam War. 

In 1965 the army, under the leadership of General Suharto initiated a takeover of Indonesia, and in the process initiated a process that has become known as the 1965 tragedy in Indonesia. Under the guise of targeting suspected communists, up to 500,000 people were killed in an act that is now recognized as genocide in many circles. The United States's role in this included the U.S embassy in Jakarta providing lists of suspected communists(5000), the CIA engaging in what was called ""black propaganda operations"" by using radio broadcasts to amplify Suharto's propaganda around the killings as well as a systematic cover-up in media reporting at this time. 

His administration has received a lot of critical scrutiny over it's role in Vietnam, but yet this aspect of the Cold War and the U.S's role has largely gone ignored despite it being listed as one of the worst mass killings of the 20th century."
