Most iconic screams in cinema?,thebladex666,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/p4rbkc/most_iconic_screams_in_cinema/,239,203,"For me it's in ""The Nice Guys"" when Russel Crowe breaks Ryan Gosling's arm. The pure comedy of the way he crawls away as he tucks his arm under to hide it while begging only to be man handled and snapped. 

OR

In ""The Lighthouse"" when Pattinson tries to empty the toilet bowls over the water and it blows back in his face.  Paired with the obvious tragedy of the disgusting splatter, painful pre teen scream & the fast cutaway really sells it for me.


What be it for ye lads?"
