At exactly what point is taking inspiration from another story considered plagiarism?,CowardlyGoblin,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/p2047s/at_exactly_what_point_is_taking_inspiration_from/,35,22,"Got an idea I've been rolling with for a while but I've realized that the general premise and theme is maybe too similar to that of something I've watched. I figure the details and the way the story is written is mostly what matters? Just in general, what are your thoughts? It feels like the line between plagiarism and not plagiarism is kind of thin so I'm always a bit on edge about what's okay and what isn't."
