Need help motivating my kid to exercise. Suggestions?,andykap9003,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/11h1fk/need_help_motivating_my_kid_to_exercise/,415,320,"I have a 13 year old who is overweight and spends most of his time on the computer. We have tried to get him to join sports teams and encouraged him to go to park with us to no avail. Does anyone else have this problem and if so how did you deal with it? 

EDIT-Thanks for all the advice guys. We have started to cut back on junk food in the house recently. But I will make more of an effort to replace that with healthier alternatives. One idea that I have is giving him the Fitbit or Nike Fuelband. Thus he can monitor his activity level during the day and hopefully compete with himself. What do you guys think?"
