Thai (Southeast Asian Historical Literature),HisKoR,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/u1onin/thai_southeast_asian_historical_literature/,16,17,"I am curious as to what the oldest extant written records or literature are for the Southeast Asian countries/languages such as Thai, Cambodian, Burmese, etc.

A cursory search showed that the oldest extant Thai written work is from the 1800's. However, that seems shockingly recent considering what a rich and long history the culture has. I could maybe chalk it up to the hot climate but plenty of Vietnamese records seem to exist from several centuries ago. Perhaps that is thanks to the Sino literary culture that the Vietnamese adopted.

Also, I am curious how writing was done in SEA (besides Vietnam). It seems they did not use the brush and ink typical of the Sinosphere countries so what were the everyday writing instruments? Does pre-modern calligraphy art exist?"
