"As a writer, what’s your relationship with music? Does music inform or inspire or otherwise affect your stories? If yes, how so?",tasteofhemlock,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/194wx8h/as_a_writer_whats_your_relationship_with_music/,40,11,"I absolutely love reading and writing but I think if music as the highest form of art.

Can’t make any myself but I can sure as shit admire it. I tend to have very intense emotional reactions to music, sometimes those musically boosts feelings have a physicality to them: chills up the spine, goose bumps, etc. 


I very often listen to music to amplify a specific emotion or mood, to kinda get in the zone for a scene’s intended theme. 


Sometimes I’ll listen to music while I’m actually writing, sometimes I’ll just listen to a song to feed my muse and then write in silence.

But music is closely related to my writing. 

Grunge might help me write angry or action scenes, blues might help me write sadder pieces, and darker atmospheric music with ambient tones sometimes helps me build mood.

I typically write horror so my playlist often has morbid lyrics or haunting tones, but there’s a big range in terms of specific artists that inspire my writing. Those who show up the most are: the doors, the toadies, the stooges, rage agains the machine, Alice In Chains, and tool. 

Some times I even write a story as an expansion  of a universe that exists in song. Almost like fan fiction. For example I recently wrote a nosleep story directly inspired by the Tom Waits song “what’s he building in there?”


But I want to know:

How do you use music in your writing process? 

What are some specific bands or songs that heavily influence or inspire your writing?"
