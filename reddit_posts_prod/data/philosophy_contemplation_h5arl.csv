Is our ability to contemplate our purpose in life the very thing that's inhibiting us from realizing and fulfilling that purpose (given that such a purpose exists?),plmunn,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/h5arl/is_our_ability_to_contemplate_our_purpose_in_life/,15,27,"I watched a honeybee fly around the other day and thought about how a 'lesser' form of life, while having a only a microscopic fraction of the cognitive capacity it would take to contemplate the reason for it's existence or even understand it's own biology, anatomy, and physiology, can fulfill it's natural purpose to near perfection... And yet, human beings, who are fully capable of understanding the complexities of their bodies and have become exceedingly efficient at contemplating their purpose in the world, do not fulfill that purpose. Above all, it made me wonder if our ability to question our reasons for existing is the cause of our inability to be as productive and efficient as say, the honeybee in fulfilling our natural purpose.

I'm interested in r/philosophy's thoughts on this.

EDIT: Forgive me if this sounds like a daft question or moot point. Being a full-time philosophy student gives me little time to actually do my own proper thought experiments, and I appreciate any feedback any of you are willing to give."
