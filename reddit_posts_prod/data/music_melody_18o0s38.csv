The Dillinger Escape Plan - Understanding Decay [Mathcore] - Melody in the chaos,simonniz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/18o0s38/the_dillinger_escape_plan_understanding_decay/,0,4,"Hi!

I just listened to DEP's Understanding Decay and found a very interesting part at 1:00. It's an instrumental part with a mind blowing guitar riff/solo, right after a very chaotic part. 

I recently discovered DEP and while I have not absorbed their whole discography yet, I had such an epiphany listening to their more popular songs that I have become an instant fan.

Dillinger is very unique, and most of their songs have hidden gems like this that you might miss on the first listen. What are your thoughts on melody in heavy songs? Do you prefer a song to be entirely heavy, or a middle spot between the two, or very distinct changes in style? "
