Chicken breasts suck,MKE1969,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/zg3taw/chicken_breasts_suck/,955,1427,"There, I said it. And you all know I’m right. But my wife wants to eat healthier this year, and every time I try and cook something with chicken breast it’s just very underwhelming and flavorless. Any suggestions on how to make chicken breasts delicious and healthy?"
