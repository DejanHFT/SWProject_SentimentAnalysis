"""Death of the Author"" is a literary analysis approach, not a thought-terminating clich√©!",Genoscythe_,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p3v943/death_of_the_author_is_a_literary_analysis/,73,248,"Lately, I have most often seen ""Death of the Author"" used synonymously with platitudes like ""you gotta separate the artist from the art"", thrown around in culture war nonsense, on the defensive side of whether this or that book is ""problematic"".

Which is a shame, because the original literary theory as started by Roland Barthes is pretty fascinating on it's own right.

By which of course  I don't mean that it is ""correct"", we are talking about literary criticism here, not physics or math, there is no such thing as a ""correct"" academic model that you are supposed to favor over all others.

Most people don't seem to be all that self-aware, about the different schools of thought that go into, for example, a review that describes what a book, that you read without ever looking up it's author, meant *to you*, and a review that praises a literary classic as it's creator's magnum opus, or for ""changing history"", or even just reading a new author's second book and praise the skill improvements since the first one.

You can either go out of your way to only see a book as your own personal experience, or as an object in context of a history, and an artist's career. But both of these are choices.

For example if you read *Huckleberry Finn*, and you also decide to research the antebellum South's history, and Mark Twain's politics, and the public commentary he made elsewhere, and appreciate the book's apparent message as a product of it's time, that's an act *in defiance of* the Death of the Author approach.

Ironically enough, someone who decides to ignore all of that context (or someone who is naturally ignoarnt of it), opens the book, sees a sentence using the n-word, and immediately get offended, is practicing a crude form of Death of the Author analysis: ""I don't care what this Mark guy originally *meant* by this, or what a nice guy he was, *to me,* in 2021, it feels insulting"".

H.P. Lovecraft is another infamous example, where the usual defenders of ""problematic"" classics, would probably be better off appealing to more context, than to less:

Researching his life's history in any capacity, one might confirm that he was a huge bigot, sure, but also that both of his parents died in asylums, and that the threat of inferiority or madness lurking in one's own heredity, was something very *intimately horrifying* to him, not ***just*** a racial thing.

In contrast, anyone invited to simply read a story like ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" while consciously ignoring any authorial context, could still *easily* come to the conclusion that even on a first read, it sounds transparently like some sort of allegory about race mixing.

Which is of course a limitation of Death of the Author: We might choose not to read (or to ignore) interviews that the author made right after publishing a book, explainging what it's message was, and we can choose not to read their wikipedia biography and psychoanalize them.

But we are still living in the world, we are familiar with it's politics and moral agendas, with tropes and coding, and we won't be entirely blind to the idea that books usually have messages and themes.

Choosing not to indulge in speculation over what the author's original ones might have been, isn't the same thing as not reading *anything* into them."
