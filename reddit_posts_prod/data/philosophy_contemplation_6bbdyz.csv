Exploring Mankind's Concepts of Nature,PrajnaPie,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/6bbdyz/exploring_mankinds_concepts_of_nature/,3,11,"
Throughout our species’ history, mankind’s ideas of nature have helped shape not only our relationship to the earth but have influenced our entire view of the universe and our place within it. When one begins to contemplate nature, we cannot help but extend our thoughts unto existential and metaphysical concerns: to contemplate God, or ultimate concern and our relationship to the universe that we unwillingly find ourselves in. However, ‘nature’ is merely a concept and its denotation has not been concrete, but rather it has held a dynamic history, evolving along with mankind’s understanding of the universe. As a species, our self-consciousness along with our advanced ability to use logic has driven us to recognize that we posses unique characteristics not found in the non-humane realm; we participate not only in the biosphere but also the noosphere: the realm of complex thought and ideas. From the biosphere, the noosphere emerged. Within the noosphere various concepts of nature have emerged, ranging from nature as the biosphere, to nature as anything non-human, to Nature as the ground of being. Evidently, there is no single or universal concept of nature; different cultures have developed many different ideas of nature, although one world-view (paradigm) has come to dominate the modern world. 	
	A framework emerging from the Judeo-Christian culture of the West has been the dominating paradigm of modernity. Hence, the concept of nature that developed in the Jude-Christian tradition now shapes how mankind has treated the earth within the modern era. This concept of nature is largely derived from Genesis 1:26: 
“Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth’”.   

In this passage we find the structure of the dominant paradigm’s relation to the earth; that there exists a metaphysical hierarchy implemented by an ultimate theistic deity. God and his realm, the heavens, reside at the top of the hierarchy, with mankind made in the God’s image residing next, and nature as the biosphere making up the bottom tier (God>Mankind>Nature). Within this paradigm, mankind is given dominion over nature; we can do what we please with it. It is a completely anthropocentric view of the universe, where the only function of the biosphere is to provide resources for mankind. A further consequence of the metaphysical hierarchy is it creates a focus on spiritual ascension. It ‘s not that seeking spiritual development is bad within itself, but an understanding which has no sense of spiritual descension can come to dangerous conclusions: this world is merely the world of sin, the world of the devil, and so what happens to it is less important. The result of this metaphysical hierarchy is that it drives one to place the emphasis of their life’s pursuit on what they think may matter in the afterlife, instead of pursing what’s important in this life. This idea that we have the God-given right to conquer the earth and the industrial revolution gave the Judeo-Christian culture the justification and the means to spread and enforce their culture throughout the world.
	This Judeo-Christian paradigm came to dominate the planet, and from this framework eventually emerged our modern paradigm. The scientific revolution and the age of reason led to the further development of logic within the noosphere; we now have an advanced understanding of natural sciences and physical forces. Through this understanding we have come to realize that our natural recourses are limited and dependent upon complex and fragile natural systems, and that we can no longer take practical advice from religious texts concerning our resource and land management. From this realization we have changed our metaphysical understanding of the universe: from Spirit ascending, resulting in the pursuit of higher spiritual attainment, to descending Spirit, or the recognition that everything is a movement of Spirit/God/emptiness unfolding eternally all around us. 
The scientific revolution and age of reason has claimed not only that we can objectively and quantitatively solve our problems, but it has even stated what qualifies as a problem in the first place. It has reduced the entire Kosmos to the ‘It’ realm, deducing that only objective and quantifiable pursuits are real and worthwhile. Spiritual, existential, transcendental, and mystical experience all became unimportant and reducible to psychological and eventually neurological terms.  Ken Wilber calls this paradigm, of descending objectivity, “Flatland” (Wilber, 258). All phenomenon can be explained by reducing them to their parts, however it is overlooked that in reality, things are more than the sum of their parts.  Within this ‘Flatland’ paradigm we no longer give weight to the idea of any type of transcendence; all things are reducible, and any suprasensible experience is reduced to an objective explanation of brain malfunction. It gives little weight to quality and instead emphasizes that truth can be found only through quantitative means. 
Despite the drawbacks of our modern paradigm, it has had many positive outcomes. The focus on descending Spirit has led to great social leaps. With our new understanding, no race, sex, orientation, or religion can logically claim superiority: we are all Homo sapiens who have emerged from a common ancestor. While social injustice is still a problem, as a species we have made great leaps by logically discerning that no cultural label is superior or inferior. Additionally through this descended grid, we can no longer logically claim dominion over natural ecosystems. We now know that it is because of these natural systems that we exist. This has lead to environmental and conservation movements that stress the importance of keeping these natural ecosystems preserved. One of the first highly influential figures who recognized that we are destroying the planet in the name of progress was John Muir.   
	John Muir was born in Scotland in 1838 and migrated to Wisconsin with his family when he was 11 years old. Becoming tired of his life on the homestead, Muir found a job in a factory, where he was nearly blinded by an industrial accident. After this accident, Muir was driven to pursue a connection with the world that was unaltered by man: a connection with the ‘wilderness’. Muir briefly studied natural sciences at the University of Wisconsin, but made the decision to leave the institution and spend his life immersed in what he referred to as the ‘University of Wilderness’ (National Park Service 1). 
Muir had a large influence on policy makers and the U.S. public, and he aided in the development of the United States’ National Parks. For example, in 1889 Muir lead the editor of Century Magazine, Robert Underwood Johnson, to the Tuolumne meadows to show the negative impacts done by the overgrazing of sheep on the land. Muir convinced Johnson that the only way to save the land was to incorporate it into a national park. Convinced by Muir, Johnson’s next publication in Century Magazine inspired a bill in the U.S. Congress proposing a system of federal administered parks. Muir continued to inspire individuals in power with hopes to administer protected land. Muir led President Roosevelt on a wilderness backpacking expedition through the Yosemite Valley, which inspired Roosevelt to set aside more than 230 million acres of public land that included five national parks and 18 national monuments (National Park Service 2). 
John Muir has had such success in influencing the people of his time because he was aware of the battling paradigms. The Judeo-Christian paradigm dominated while a new paradigm based upon reason and objective scientific truths just began to emerge. These paradigms are still battling today, and perhaps that is why Muir is still so admired. Muir didn’t challenge the readers with a new worldview, but instead played with the idea of the wilderness already dominating at the time. Through his writing he attempted to portray ‘wilderness’ as desirable to man in the mass. He had the new age of reason to quantifiably back up his logic, and the dogma of the Judeo-Christian paradigm to play with the reader’s emotions. To evaluate the assumptions and ideas about nature that Muir’s writings prompt, it’s relevant to recall what I’ve heard my professor Les Alldritt allude many times: it’s not the content that’s truly important but the system, or rather the paradigm. By looking at not just what Muir says, but also how and why he says it we can effectively recognize both the strengths and weaknesses of his perspective.
Muir’s essay, In the Heart of the California Alps is not an aggressive plead for conservation, nor a critique of his culture and politics. Instead, Muir hoped to inspire the reader to go venture and experience immersion in natural spaces for themselves. Muir was an advocate for ‘wilderness’. He was quite fed up with civilization and portrayed, romantically, how large wild places can transform someone for the better. He describes his setting: 
“the whole massive uplift of the range, four hundred and fifty miles long, by about seventy five wide, is one grand picture, not clearly divisible into smaller ones” (345). 

Here we see that for Muir, the way to connect with nature is to be in the ‘wilderness’, and that the ‘wilderness’ is found solely in grand landscapes. The ‘wilderness’ must be complete, and it must be wild. It cannot be ‘divisible’ and therefore the ‘wilderness’ is found where civilization, or mankind, is not. This description of ‘wilderness’ disassociates mankind from nature by enforcing a duality that was instigated within the Judeo-Christian paradigm: that civilization and wilderness are opposite poles. While preserving natural spaces is certainly important, the disassociation between civilization and wilderness leads to dangerous and delusional assumptions about our relationship to the planet. 
Muir dances between the opposing paradigms of ascension and descension with short descriptions using romantically religious language to describe scenery and the feelings it inspires, but also uses the religious metaphor sparingly and focuses little on existential implications of the experience. Descriptions like:

“at the touch of this divine light, the mountains seemed to kindle a rapt, religious consciousness, and stood hushed like devout worshipers waiting to be blessed” (Muir 348)

Here, Muir appeals to spiritual ascension while simultaneously appealing to the descended grid by using religious language aesthetically opposed to existentially.  While Thoreau and Emerson where highly attentive to metaphysical insights, Muir remains a romantic; one must read between the lines to become aware of his transcendent experiences. For example, Muir writes 

“ to describe the glorious Alps….would require the love-work of a whole life. The lessons and enjoyments of even a single day would probably weary most readers, however consumingly interested they might be if brought into actual contact with them” (345, Muir)

With this description Muir alludes to the infinite magnitude and the ineffability of the numinous experience often encountered within natural spaces, spaces with minimal manipulation by man. He explains that despite the limitations of words in describing an experience, the experience itself is nevertheless consuming and can only truly be experienced subjectively. Muir’s famous statement, ""when we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe"" demonstrates that he, at least intellectually, comprehended nonduality and interconnectedness, but likely understood the shortcomings of attempting to describe it to the man in the mass during his time. Thus instead of focusing on the subjective experience, he appeals to the descended grid by exploring immersion in a natural space through a more objective means than philosophy; he uses “a strip of narrative” (345, Muir). 
	As it is Muir’s aim in making ‘wilderness’ appear desirable throughout his narrative, his description of his experiences are overwhelmingly positive. He comes across almost as a primitivist, and hardly ever depicts immersion in ‘wilderness’ as frightening; rather, he describes it as a place where one can rejuvenate mentally, physically, and perhaps spiritually. He describes, 

“in so wild and so beautiful a region my first day was spent, every sight and sound novel and inspiring, leading one far out of oneself, yet feeding and building a strict individuality” (346, Muir)

Here Muir hints, romantically, to a mystical experience, where one paradoxically finds themself to be something more than oneself but also nothing more. As Les Alldritt has often described, “I am Les and I am also the Universe”. However, Muir consciously neglects to describe the feeling of death and impermanence that accompany most peak or numinous experiences. For Muir wants to make these experiences seem solely enjoyable; he romanticizes them. Throughout his narrative any moments of fear or danger are extremely brief and are dominated by joyous descriptions. For example he describes his experience of nearly falling down a mountain:

“This terrible eclipse lasted only a moment, when life blazed forth again with preternatural clearness. I seemed suddenly to become possessed of a new sense” (350, Muir)

Here Muir admits that moments of terror do happen, but reinforces that they are indeed only momentary; this is certainly not the reality of many ‘wilderness’ expeditions. Muir focuses on the positive side of these experiences, but doesn’t engage in deep contemplation or descriptions of these mystical experiences. He is weary of upsetting the new paradigm of the descending grid with long descriptions of transcendent experiences, but also doesn’t want to negate them completely as the Judeo-Christian paradigm is still the dominating framework of his time and is enthralled with the transcendent.
	Muir attempts to appeal to each paradigm, the Christian ascenders and the emerging reason of the descenders. However, the world at this time is still dominated by Christianity and therefore Muir instigates the metaphysical hierarchy of Christianity, while trying to also incorporate the knowledge of natural science and reason. Muir upholds the Christian hierarchy, as evident when he writes:

“God’s glacial-mills grind slowly, but they have been kept in motion long enough to grind sufficient soil for any Alpine crop” (Muir 347). 

Here we can pick out all three parts of the hierarchy and their order. Muir’s use of the word ‘crop’, opposed to a more neutral word like plant, suggests that the purpose of the plant is to be consumed by humans. He also attributes these natural processes to God’s will.  Hence, this quote contains all three levels of the Christian Hierarchy: God>Mankind>Nature. However, Muir also attempts to show that our knowledge of natural cycles and systems doesn’t oppose the idea of something transcendent:

“Now, in deep brooding silence all seems motionless, as if the work of creation were done. But in the midst of this outer steadfastness we know there is incessant motion. … Here are the roots of all the life of the valleys, and here more simply than elsewhere is the eternal flux of nature manifested. Ice changing to water, lakes to meadows, and mountains to plains. And while we thus contemplate Nature’s methods of landscape creation… we also learn that as these we now behold have succeeded those of pre-glacial age, so they in turn are withering and vanishing to be succeeded by others yet unborn” (Muir 351)

In this passage, Muir explores the idea of creationism, appealing to the Judeo-Christian paradigm, and shows that creation is not a single stagnant act, but is manifested as a dynamic, unfolding, delicate process. Without demanding a reevaluation of our land management, Muir simply shows how the resources that we depend upon are the product of natural systems that must remain in tact for the biosphere to continue in a way that is still hospitable to mankind. Through descriptions like this, Muir attempts to condition the mind toward conservation without blatantly demanding it.  
	John Muir certainly has had impactful influence upon society’s regard to nature; he facilitated in essential steps toward environmental conservation. Muir’s work should undoubtedly be read and revered, however it should not be idolized. We should not interpret Muir’s thought as the pinnacle of mankind’s relationship to the universe. We must continue to develop our concept of nature and build upon our history of interpretation. Muir’s framework had flaws, which can be seen through a post-modern perspective. 
One flaw in Muir’s interpretation, which has been examined in the above interpretation of In the Heart of the California Alps is his reinforcement of the Christian metaphysical hierarchy: God>Mankind>Nature. While Muir attempts to add logical content within this framework, that the act of creation is ongoing and fragile, not stagnant and permanent, his assumptions still rest upon the foundation which places an anthropomorphic theistic being as the ultimate. I do not mean to disenfranchise the idea of God, but the idea of God as an anthropomorphic being the in the sky who gave humans dominion over the earth is absolutely ludacris in light of modern knowledge and reason. To instigate this framework will only enforce a worldview that actively turns its head to new experience in order to uphold tradition, dogma, and often oppression. In relation to the well being of the biosphere the Judeo-Christian paradigm has overall historically done a dismal job in helping to maintain the diversity, resilience, and health of our biosphere. Fortunately there are many Christian perspectives and interpretations, but to participate in a perspective that actively ignores the advancements of mankind’s understanding is foolish, ignorant, and disheartening.
Muir’s writing also instigates a worldview that disassociates humans from nature. He insinuates that one has to travel into vast natural landscapes to experience nature. David Cronan, a post-modern philosopher, has explained:
“Any way of looking at nature that encourages us to believe we are separate from nature – as wilderness tends to do – is likely to reinforce environmentally irresponsible behavior” (Cronan, 87)

 By distinguishing wilderness from civilization, we disassociate ourselves from wilderness, and consequently nature. Through this disassociation our modern culture disconnects how our collective lifestyle and habits within civilization affect our biosphere. I’m not arguing that we shouldn’t have protected natural spaces, however our disconnection with nature, driven in part by the concept of wilderness, allows us to make poor environmental choices because we have disassociated ‘wilderness’ and civilization. Cronan comments:
 
“Idealizing a distant wilderness too often means not idealizing the environment in which we actually live…Most of our serious environmental problems start right here, at home. … The wilderness dualism tends to cast any use as ab-use, and therby denies us a middle ground in which a responsible use and non-use might attain some kind of balanced, sustainable relationship” (Cronan 85).


	Furthermore, Muir’s romanticizing of the ‘wilderness’ parallels primitivism and makes no contribution to how man in the mass can actively change to better our environment. It makes no difference if highly consumptive individuals spend a weekend in the ‘wilderness’ and then go back to their ‘civilized’ habits that are the cause of the planet’s environmental degradation. If mankind is to continue as a species, our culture needs to evolve, not regress. Our solutions will not come through a return to primitive culture, but rather we must have an integral approach which utilizes our modern knowledge and technology to facilitate a low consumptive, sustainable society. We must mend our relationship with nature by recognizing that ‘nature’ is merely a term for the forces guiding the unfolding process of the universe. We are nature, as well are our cities. The same underlying force that grounds the biosphere also grounds the noosphere and human civilization. Ken Wilber explains the danger of romanticizing the ‘wilderness’ :

“Reducing the Kosmos to flatland sensory nature, and then trying to become one with that nature is biocentric immersion, [which] leads to profoundly regressive, preconventional, body-bound, narcissistic glorification… This is not compassion, this is regression” (Wilber, 320).        

Just as the Dao cannot be said, true Nature cannot be reduced to the sensory biosphere. Our understanding as a species must evolve from our modern paradigm into an integral, post-modern approach.  
	A post-modern understanding must unite our disassociations while maintaining a comprehension that there is a way in which mankind can work along with nature. I have explained that the idea of ‘wilderness’ is merely myth; there is really only one body of water and one atmosphere. We have manipulated both the atmosphere and our water so the idea that there are any spaces that humans have not impacted is fantasy. Cronan suggest that instead of thinking in dualities like ‘wilderness’ and ‘civilization’ we should think of the earth as a spectrum: that the earth contains environments with a variable degree of manipulation made by mankind. Within this framework we unite our delusional disassociations and maintain that there still exists a natural way. Through logic and scientific advancement, humans have altered ecosystems in ways that would have not occurred without the influence of the noosphere. However we must recognize the measure of ‘naturalness’ cannot merely be interpreted objectively, but also requires a subjective experience. For example eating organic, or ‘natural’, foods creates a healthier body and mind, and consequently leads to a healthier subjective experience. Unnatural foods that are processed and filled with man-made preservatives, sweeteners, and other chemicals facilitate an unhealthy body, mind, and subjective experience. Natural landscapes create positive subjective experiences for the biota involved, while degraded unnatural spaces create both objectively unhealthy ecological cycles as well as poor subjective experiences for the biota involved. Thus to develop a post-modern understanding of nature, we must unite subject and object and recognize that while, in practice, facilitating natural cycles is done objectively, it is only through subjective experience that we know Nature. A natural condition brings about a positive subjective experience. 
	One movement that has attempted to incorporate a post-modern idea of nature into an active culture is permaculture. Permaculture is a movement started in the late 70’s by Bill Mollison and David Holmgrem that provides basic principles in designing a sustainable culture that can thrive indefinitely (permanent culture = permaculture). In Mollison’s book, Permaculture, A Designer’s Manual he defines the practice:

“Permaculture is the conscious design and maintenance of agriculturally productive ecosystems, which have the diversity, stability, and resilience of natural ecosystems. It is the harmonious integration of landscape and people, producing their food, energy, shelter, and other material and non-material needs, in a sustainable way. Without permanent agriculture there is no possibility of a stable social order”  (Mollison 1). 
	
Within this loose definition we can see the elements of a post-modern understanding of nature. There is no instigation of the ‘wilderness-civilization’ duality’; permaculture, ideally, is a practice of the masses, so that everyone develops a relationship with the earth. Nature is not merely recognized in wilderness, but is seen everywhere, and everywhere and everyone has the potential to facilitate diverse, stable, and resilient natural ecosystems. Mollison also recognizes that we cannot merely measure the quality of our lives and the earth objectively, but includes subjective ‘non-material needs’ as an integral component. Permaculture hopes to influence our cultural lifestyle so that the daily routine of the masses helps facilitate productive and resilient ecosystems instead of the current result of our cultural habits, which primarily deplete recourses and produce mass amounts of waste. In a permaculture, individuals attempt to gain all their material and non-material needs from the very environment in which they live. Through permaculture, mankind has to potential to halt our parasitic relationship to the earth and instead build a relationship in which humans play a beneficial role in aiding ecological cycles. In David Holgmgren’s book, Permaculture: Principles & Pathways Beyond Sustainability, Holmgren analyzes the implications and philosophical framework of the post-modern relationship to nature through permaculture.   
	Holmgren begins the philosophical framework by listing three major ethical principles of permaculture. The second two are derived from the first: 
“Care for the earth/ Care for people/ Set limits to consumption and reproduction, and redistribute surplus” (Holmgren, 1)

Hence the primary ethical concern is a utilitarian concern of earth as a whole, people included. This is a much more grounded and realistic view of the world. In practice, the primary concern of our modern culture is money, which isn’t even real. The value of a dollar is completely made-up, especially sense we have dropped the gold standard, and our assumptions about our fail-proof economic system and the ‘guiding hand’ have proved to fail us repeatedly. Thus permaculture looks at the planet both objectively, through scientific ecological methods, and subjectively, by viewing ecosystems not merely as recourses but fundamental to the well being of the earth. Holmgren explains, that as we attempt to transition into a sustainable culture “we need to consider and attempt to understand a broader canvas of values and concepts than those delivered to us by recent history” (Holmgren, 1). Our modern paradigm has been shaped by activity that is not sustainable. The presumption of a capitalist economy is to experience infinite growth, however to expect this to happen on a planet with a limited energy budget and limited recourses is delusional. Holmgren explains that with a post-modern understanding we need to be critical about the values that have shaped our culture in recent times:     

“We should expect that the beliefs and values that have developed with a rising energy base are likely to be dysfunctional – even destructive – in a world of limited and declining energy” (Holmgren, 2)        
	
While the recent discoveries of oil reserves around the planet may provide the resources to continue our modern lifestyle indefinitely, the resulting emissions would dramatically alter the earth’s atmosphere and climate so that our industrial activity might very well be the cause of our own demise. Holmgren explains that from our dualistic mode of thought, which separates mind and body, humanity and nature, thought and action, subject and object, the field of reductionist science has come to dominate how we investigate the world. This reductionist science, “which seeks the fundamental causes of material and living complexity in simple constitutes” (Holmgren 2) neglects looking at the intricate consequences of using this simplistic and unrealistic framework. Systems are more than the sum of there parts; you cannot tell the time from a disassembled watch. Thus permaculture recognizes the utility in reductionist science, but stresses that it is only valuable if what is learned can be applied to the system as a whole. So a post-modern view should combine practical knowledge from reductionism, along with the integral approach of systems theory that looks at the non-material interactions between reducible components and their interconnected relationships.
Holmgren also explains that permaculture, which can be understood practically as essentially materialist and scientific, facilitates a non-dual perspective that aids in spiritual development. He explains:
	
“Robert Theobold and others have expounded the idea that the very success of science and materialism has led us to a state of disharmony and discontent, which is almost without historical precedent, and they argue that a shift to a more spiritually base value system is essential if we are to survive” (Holmgren, 2)


Hence, permaculture incorporates the objective scientific perspective along with a qualitative subjective perspective, which aids in one’s existential development and increases one’s religious (re-legion, or reconnecting to our perceived discontinuities) sentiment. Holmgren says that he is proud of his atheist and humanist upbringing, however he admits that the relationship to the earth that is developed through permaculture transcends a mere materialist understanding. He writes: 
“through the project of permaculture, my life is by small increments is being drawn towards some sort of spiritual awareness and perspective that is not yet clear” (Holmgren, 3)

Permaculture can aid in our development of a post-modern understanding of nature by prompting activity that draws us internally and develops a mindful lifestyle that seeks joy through material and non-material means. By developing our internal senses we come to understand that nature permeates us and we permeate through nature. It enables non-dual realizations that prompt us to seek well-being through a nurturing relationship with our universe. It would abolish our current infatuation with distractions and inanimate sensations. Permaculture aids in our development in seeing humanity’s inherent interconnectedness with our environment and universe. If permaculture were practiced culturally, our separation with nature would be mended and our existential discontent may drown in a spiritual revolution that thrives on our active relationships with each other and the earth as a whole.
