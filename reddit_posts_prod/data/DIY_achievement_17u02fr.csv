How do I paint over this?,drunkkard69,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/17u02fr/how_do_i_paint_over_this/,1,0,"&#x200B;

The wooden beam structure on my patio has a lot of flecks in the paint like this. Given the age of the house, this may be lead based paint, so I don't want to deal with removing the existing paint at all.

I plan on painting over this with three coats of new paint, but I feel the finish will not be smooth. There will be dimples/outlines where there is paint currently missing.

Any advice on how to achieve a smooth finish? Thanks."
