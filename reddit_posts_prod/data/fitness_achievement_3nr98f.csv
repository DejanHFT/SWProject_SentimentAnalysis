I finally achieved my goal of 125 lbs lost in just over 10 months. Before/after/soul searching inside.,puffmonkey92,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3nr98f/i_finally_achieved_my_goal_of_125_lbs_lost_in/,160,762,"Hey, guys! I just wanted to say thanks for all of your support. I've lurked here time to time over the last couple years while I've been powerlifting, and more intently in the last 10 months while I've lost all this weight. It's incredible the amount of knowledge and experience that's here, as well as the overwhelming positivity that is Fittit.

When I started this journey, I was 375 lbs. [This is what I looked like in May, and I probably put on another 15-20 lbs between this and when I started losing weight soon after Thanksgiving, in late November.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwqZhqF7_g) I was eating anywhere between 7-9,000kcal a day, justifying it to myself as ""oh, I'm strong as fuck, so it doesn't matter!"" even though I was weak for my weight and had trouble breathing at night (when I rolled on to my back, my stomach literally started to crush my lungs a little) and had severe knee pain whenever my knees weren't wrapped up with my Parallel Breakers from liftinglarge.com. One morning, after I had all my joints crack, pop, and grind, I decided enough was enough. I'd done some diets here and there, with great success, but I couldn't mentally handle the severe drop in strength that came with losing weight. That morning, however, something broke inside of me. I'd been single for about a year and a half (still am, but whatever), and was becoming increasingly resentful toward myself and my body image. I realized that day that I was killing myself, and I decided right then and there that I was going to end this. There was no period of easing into it, there was no gradual calorie cut. I went from 7-9000kcal to 3000kcal. Started eating no carbs at ALL. I went full ketosis on the first day, and the race was on. I set a goal of myself losing 100 lbs, to get down to 275.

After I'd gotten in to the rhythm of it, before I knew it 50 lbs had dropped off. [This is a before/after of me. The first picture is at 323 lbs, when I started taking progress pics. The second is me this morning, at 249 lbs.](http://imgur.com/gallery/IbzC4?lr=0) I feel an unbelievable amount better. I can now run for 5 miles without stopping (at a 9 min/mile pace, but still). I can now do 5x5 wide grip pullups with decent form (after not being able to do a single one). My knees no longer hurt, my back feels like it's new, and I don't feel myself gasping for air at night after waking up on my back. I feel as different as I look.

My diet consisted of ultra-high protein keto, with lots of fats, staying under ~3000kcal a day. Once I hit about 323 lbs, I started doing more cardio, running 1-2x a week. Throughout, I was doing the 5/3/1 template of training 4 days a week, bench, squat, dead, and OHP days. 

Any questions, feel free to fire away. I feel like a whole new man right now.

EDIT: Forgot my height/weight. SW: 375 EW: 249. 6'4"""
