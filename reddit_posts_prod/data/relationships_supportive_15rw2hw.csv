"I (30F) have a kind, supportive, but extremely awkward friend (31F). What do I do?",After-Explorer-62,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15rw2hw/i_30f_have_a_kind_supportive_but_extremely/,3,1,"I grew up with my friend ""Sarah"". Sarah has always been kind, supportive, caring, and genuine/sincere. Sarah and I have never had any sort of ""drama"". We've never really fought, been catty, gossipy, etc. There is absolutely ZERO ill will here.

However.

Sarah is awkward.

Like, with a capital A.

Maybe it wasn't really noticeable when we were younger. Or maybe everyone else kind of matured as we got older when Sarah didn't. But Sarah is really, really awkward. It's gotten to the point where it is draining being around her, and every time we do something together I need a while to recover before I can see her again.

**Example 1:** A group of 4 of us had pre-drinks at my apartment, and then went out to dinner. After dinner, the other 2 were ready to go home, but Sarah assumed that the 4 of us would go to back to my place to chat and hang out. Since we had no plans the next day, we all went back to my place. As the night got later and later, everyone was clearly feeling it. The three of us kept saying things like ""It's getting late. I'm getting tired. We should go."" but Sarah would plead ""Com'on, let's just keep watching this!"" repeatedly.

After that day, the other friends mentioned to me privately that they thought the whole night was exhausting because Sarah couldn't tell that everyone was just tired and wanted to go home.

**Example 2:** I hosted a large dinner party, and invited Sarah. I also invited another (non-mutual) friend who was a bride-to-be and I was one of her bridesmaids. The bride-to-be quickly pulled me aside to give me a surprise bridesmaids gift-package: a small box of chocolates and some other goodies. There weren't enough chocolates for the whole party, so I put the whole package away and went back to the party.

Everyone at the party was allowed to stay overnight (no drinking and driving on my watch) if they needed to. At the end of the night, everyone had gone home (DD/Rideshares). Sarah was the only one who stayed.

When I mentioned to my spouse that I was really thankful for the chocolates from bride-to-be, Sarah said ""Oh, did someone bring chocolates? Where are they?"". I explained to Sarah that a bride-to-be brought some chocolates for me, for being a bridesmaid, and I had put them away. My spouse doubled down that the chocolates were a gift for me and the reason I put them away was because there wasn't enough for everyone at the party. Sarah went to search for them and came back frustrated and reiterated, ""Where are the chocolates? I can't find them.""

I think she genuinely believed that the chocolates were for the dinner party, and now since everyone else was gone, it was okay to eat them. When I finally showed her where the gift package was (I don't mind sharing chocolates at the end of the day) I think she finally realized that it was a private gift for me, and not for meant for sharing. She didn't eat any chocolates, but I'm more concerned about how long it took for her to realize this, and how she kept hounding us for the chocolates despite how many times we tried to tell her they weren't for the party.

**Example 3:** Back in school when I was studying/working/doing homework, Sarah would sometimes just hover and watch. If we had plans later that day I would say things like ""Hey you can go ahead without me, I just need to get this done, I'll join you later."" and she'd say ""I can't leave, I'd feel bad if I left without you."" then she'd continue to stare over my shoulder.

It makes me super uncomfortable to have someone staring at me while I'm working. Anyone else might've been like ""I'll just watch youtube videos while I wait"" or ""Let me help you get this done faster"" or ""Sure, I'll go on ahead and see you there"".

But not Sarah. Sarah just... hovers. I've been told I'm not the only one she's done this to.

The list goes on and on.

None of it is ever malicious. I want to make that really clear. She always just toes the line of what is/isn't socially acceptable but never crosses it. I feel silly for even making a post. Looking at my examples, the things seem so minor.

She can't seem to read the mood of a room or of other people that well. I think she might have a hard time making new and maintaining old relationships because of this. She possibly might be lonely as a result and thus more eager/insistent when hanging out. I feel pressure to spend time with her, but at the same time, spending time with her can be so draining. She is incredibly well-intentioned and caring, she just doesn't know how to read a room. I don't think I can broach this subject with her without absolutely crushing her.

I suspect she might be on the spectrum. I don't know too much about all the ways autism can present itself so this is literally just speculation. She doesn't seem like my friends/family/clients/coworkers who are diagnosed/confirmed on the spectrum. She is much nicer/more caring, more sensitive/easily hurt, more eager for socialization/attention, and doesn't seem to have special interests, but what do I know? I'm no expert.

Basically my problem is two fold:

1. How can I maintain this friendship when being with her is draining?
2. How can I help her be less socially awkward so she can make and maintain more friendships for herself? I genuinely want the best for her and the best for our friendship.

tl;dr: I have a friend who is so awkward, her inability to read a room might be slowly isolating her. I feel a lot of pressure to spend time with her because she is a genuinely a good friend, and a kind, caring person. But her awkwardness makes it really draining to be with her for a long time. How do I approach this?

Small update: I try to be as absolutely as direct as I can with her. To the point I've been told that I 'm being rude. I mostly learned that way of communicating from interacting with other people on the spectrum. With Sarah it doesn't seem to work. She usually just keeps doing whatever she's doing."
