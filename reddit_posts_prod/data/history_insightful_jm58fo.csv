"Finally read When Titans Clashed by David Glantz, some thoughts",catch-a-stream,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/jm58fo/finally_read_when_titans_clashed_by_david_glantz/,44,764,"So I finally got around to reading When Titans Clashed, which is often recommended as the best book on East Front in WW2 here and elsewhere. Just wanted to share some impressions, and curious what others thought about it.

Overall it felt like indeed a great summary of the war, and I think the reputation for slaying the ""unwashed Soviets hordes"" myth is well deserved, but at the same time it was surprisingly dry and boring for large chunks of it with some small and frankly surprising mistakes. For context I've been interested in the subject of WW2 for a long time now, and read quite a bit on it, including some of the Russian stuff, both post and pre Perestroika, and the book still had some interesting ideas I haven't seen elsewhere before.

Pros:

* He addresses and attacks the myth of ""Soviet horde"" at multiple spots explicitly, and I think he does a good job of explaining where it came from and deconstructing all the ways it's wrong
* He was also (suprisingly?) aware of the whole recent revisionist Russian history that tried to show that Stalin was actually planning the war in 1941. To be clear, this is fairly controversial and not accepted view in Russia either, but the book does a good job of deconstructing this myth as well, and showing how it couldn't been true
* His insights about the whole ""surprise on June 22nd"" are interesting, and he basically shows how despite indeed having quite a few warnings, the Soviets had reasons not to trust those. It's a really good solution for the whole ""how Stalin was so stupid"" which I haven't really seen addresses as elegantly elsewhere
* In general, he seems to present a good insights about the inner working and thinking of Stavka (Soviet High Command) and some of things they have done and why, both good and bad. For example he addresses how Soviets decided to stop before Warsaw when the revolt started (they were overstretched and couldn't push far rather than the somewhat common idea that they wanted Germans to crush the revolt), but also how for example they intentionally delayed taking Berlin to setup better conditions for post war, which ended up costing a lot of casualties.
* The whole analysis of strategies and tactics, and contrasting them between Germans and Soviets as the war progressed was very interesting indeed. I've also liked how he deconstructed the whole ""it was Hitler's mistakes"" thing that a lot of post war Germans were trying to push.

Cons:

* The book can be extremely boring and repetitive for like 75% of it... it's literally this division moved this way, and then turned there, and that other division went that way. I mean, I get the limitations of the format, but none of it was useful, interesting or necessary. Instead of all of that, I wish they just put some better maps and be done with it.
* There were some weird and persistent inaccuracies sprinkled throughout. The weirdest one was the entire business of ""IS-3"" which is mentioned repeatedly, but didn't exist until after the war. I've seen it mentioned before here and it's really surprising how this wasn't caught and addressed
* I kind of wish more time was spend on the personalities involved, he does some of that at places, but it's mostly very dry and in-personal
* While he did mostly deconstruct the Soviet hordes myth, one thing that was never addressed are the casualties that Soviet suffered. Even if we ignore '41, Soviets kept suffering way worse casualties than Germans for most of the war, all the way up until late '44 and I wish there was some analysis as to why this was happening. If the whole one rifle two soldiers thing is not true (and it's not), what was the cause of such disrepancies?

&#x200B;

So yeah... great book, and I get the praise, but frankly I wish someone made a lite version of it, replacing all the details of troop movements with few YouTube animations, and refocusing on the people and the analysis."
