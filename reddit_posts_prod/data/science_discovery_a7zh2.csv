"We get it, you're an Atheist...",DasCheeze,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/a7zh2/we_get_it_youre_an_atheist/,1848,1561,"But seriously, this reddit is for goddamned science, not petty attacks on religions.  

If someone makes an astounding discovery in a field of science and that find is somehow contrary to one or more dogma of a religion, post it, but leave the religion-bashing at /r/atheism.  If we wanted to read the ""because of discovery A, Christianity is dumb"" we'd sub to /r/atheism.

I'm subbed to /r/science because I care about scientific discovery, not someone's childish, petty jabs at a strawman.
