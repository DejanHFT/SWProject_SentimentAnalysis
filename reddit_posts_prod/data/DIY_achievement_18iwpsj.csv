Is it possible to level these gaps without stripping paint first?,Meaty03One,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/18iwpsj/is_it_possible_to_level_these_gaps_without/,4,7,"[Pictures in the comments]

Looking for any tips or tricks to flatten out this wall. I have the original paint to cover it up after, but I have a very short time to accomplish it, hoping for something that can be achieved in an afternoon but all suggestions welcome. Car is in for repairs and not sure when itâ€™s back (hence doing some DIY), so a trip to the hardware store is out for now. 
The wall is cement plaster underneath. I have filler but really hoping to avoid stripping paint to fill it, wait to dry, and then repaint. 

Thank you in advance."
