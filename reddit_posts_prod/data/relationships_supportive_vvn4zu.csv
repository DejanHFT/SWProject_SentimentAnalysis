My (16m) friends are incredibly supportive people but gossip like crazy and its confusing me a lot.,stubby_squid,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vvn4zu/my_16m_friends_are_incredibly_supportive_people/,1,1,"
Hello. I have a big friend group (all of them 15-16 of both genders) and they are all very supportive of me. I’ve been friends with most of them for 3-4 years and I can always go to them to vent, rant, and just generally feel comfortable with. I’m an athlete and go all over the country for games and almost always at least 2 of them will be there, regardless of how far it is. 

They are all very understanding and loving people towards me but they have an awful habit of gossiping. They say absolutely awful things about other people and I hate it. I’ve caught myself gossiping too and thats the part I dislike the most. I don’t mind a little banter about people and all that but the way they talk about people crosses many lines. I don’t know what to do about these relationships. On one hand they are otherwise great, smart, and supportive people but on the other hand the way they talk about other people they dislike breaks many of my own moral rules. I know its incredibly vague but I have very little grasp on how to handle these things given they are my first “real” friends (I was quite the weirdo in grade/elementary school).

tl;dr : My otherwise amazing friends have a habit of saying awful gossip about people and it crosses my moral lines"
