Please help me find my father's murderer,thenoahreaction,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dkjzz/please_help_me_find_my_fathers_murderer/,673,793,"My father was murdered in Costa Rica on the 9th. I am still in shock. He was killed for his backpack, which had only a book, towel, and some suntan in it. He was 65 and loving his life- involving himself with music and often traveling with his girlfriend. He would stop by for dinner every few weeks and we would catch up, talk about goals, etc. I miss him like hell.

The killer is still at large- the CR police probably have his fingerprints, and the US Embassy folks say they have an ongoing investigation. But I know they are underfunded, and this probably won't get much attention. I've put together a website ( http://justiceforsteve.wordpress.com ) to help find his killer. It is just a draft- can you guys give me some advice on how to make it better? Please be sensitive with your comments, but I am looking for ways to improve the site.

I am also taking promissory donations- that means if somebody submits information which leads to the arrest and conviction of the killer, I will contact the donors and ask them to direct their promised money to the reward fund, which will then be given to the eligible person(s). A little money goes a long way down there.. I've already promised/donated $1000 toward the fund, and kind people in the Puerto Viejo community have more than matched my contribution. It is nice to know that people care.


Update: 


The killer is still at large.

Thank you for contributing both privately and publicly, kind redditors.  And thank you for your kind comments and suggestions.  I have been dealing with my grief and trying to stay somewhat functional.. not an easy task for me.  I am not upset by the trolls- that would give them too much pleasure.  Everybody has to deal with loss at some point.  

I was surprised to get a call from Fox News at some dreary hour about a week ago- they wanted to do a piece on my website/reddit campaign.  And then they did, and it was somewhat sensationalistic and didn't mention the efforts of the Puerto Viejo community- who have contributed vastly more than the redditors.  I'm not sure what Dad would have thought about all this.
