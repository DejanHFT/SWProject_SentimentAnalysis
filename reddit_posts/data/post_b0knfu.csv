AskScience AMA Series: I am Professor Kartik Hosanagar and I'm here to discuss how algorithms and AI control us and how we can control them. Ask Me Anything!,AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/b0knfu/askscience_ama_series_i_am_professor_kartik/,64,223,"Through the technology embedded in web-enabled devices, algorithms and the programs that power them make a staggering number of everyday decisions for us, from what products we buy, to where we decide to eat, to how we consume our news, to whom we date, and how we find a job. We've even delegated life-and-death decisions to algorithms-decisions once made by doctors, pilots, and judges.

In my new recently published book, ``A Human's Guide to Machine Intelligence: How Algorithms Are Shaping Our Lives and How We Can Stay in Control'', I have surveyed this brave new world and revealed the potentially dangerous biases they can give rise to as they increasingly run our lives. I make the compelling case that we need to arm ourselves with a better, deeper, more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon of artificial intelligence. I have examined episodes like Microsoft's chatbot Tay, (which was designed to converse on social media like a teenage girl, but instead turned sexist and racist), the fatal accidents of self-driving cars, and even our own common, and often frustrating, experiences on services like Netflix and Amazon.

I will be available fro 3-5PM ET (19-21 UT). Ask me anything!
