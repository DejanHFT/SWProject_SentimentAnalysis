What historical accounts lead some historians to believe that some knights had PTSD?,INTelliJentsia,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/j0c4yg/what_historical_accounts_lead_some_historians_to/,353,2726,I've heard second-hand accounts of knights writing how horrifying it was to see another group of knights bearing down on you with lances on horseback in battle and read in college how a lord delighted in the screams of men dying on the battlefield. But I haven't heard or found sources for events of the first situation. I want to read what knights actually wrote and would be grateful if someone could quote or point me to sources and/or specific passages.
