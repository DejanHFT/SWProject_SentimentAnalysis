Should a writer just fully acknowledge stories that they drew inspiration from?,Jerswar,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/sd6hz6/should_a_writer_just_fully_acknowledge_stories/,18,7,"I don't know where exactly the lines between inspiration, ripoff and homage lie, and I don't think anyone else does either. Is it safer to just keep quiet?

For instance, a while back I read a vampire story by a noted author, and I took some of the basic ideas of the vampire society, how they function, and their relationship with their blood donors, and put my own spin on it.

I feel I might as well acknowledge the story that inspired mine in the afterword. How do you feel about this, in general?"
