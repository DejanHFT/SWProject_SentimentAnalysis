Shouldn't the point of education be to encourage creativity and exploration and self-learning?,emelrad12,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/wo81m4/shouldnt_the_point_of_education_be_to_encourage/,31,29,"Besides the basics of math and being able to read and write, the vast majority of other classes are completely useless in terms of retaining knowledge. This makes me wonder what is even the point of having the other classes. One argument that I've heard is that to prepare people for future college they might choose, or to produce well-rounded individuals. Yet most universities assume you know nothing and start from 0, and I am not sure how ""biology"" makes someone better if they remember 0 things.

I am not a teacher but I have helped out other students for fun mostly, and the most important thing has always been to make them interested in the subject, and to make them be excited and learn on their own.

I just heard sometimes people say education shouldn't be fun, or interesting. IMHO this is so inefficient, I've seen people just jump light years ahead if they actually started caring about the subject, but at this point, the education system became just a hindrance."
