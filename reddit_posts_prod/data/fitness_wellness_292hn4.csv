TL/DR:

-Washington city council been planning to add 5.75% tax on service including gym membership

-ppl have been fighting it, being called ""the yoga tax"" since also covers yoga centers but also includes gyms

-yesterday city council voted to keep tax

Penalizing people for being healthy so government has more money to flush down the toilet.
