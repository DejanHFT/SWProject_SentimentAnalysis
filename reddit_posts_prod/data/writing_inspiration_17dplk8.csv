Inspiration from other genres,Possible-Wall9427,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/17dplk8/inspiration_from_other_genres/,0,0,"Do you take inspiration from outside your genre? For example if you’re writing sci-fi, are you reading Ernest Hemingway or something else unexpected?

I’m writing that literary fiction/romance/drama genre and I love anything that’s gripping from that genre, but also the likes of Stephen King, Margaret Atwood, Irvine Welsh. If it’s gritty or looks brutally at the human condition, I’m in."
