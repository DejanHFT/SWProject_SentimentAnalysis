"My (30f) partner has big issues with their family (they , 30), how to be more supportive?",chatxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/sb7p1n/my_30f_partner_has_big_issues_with_their_family/,4,1,"Hey guys,
So, i came here to ask for some advice for a difficult situation im dealing with im wondering how to support better my partner.
So their(30) mom(60) with whom they always had a rocky relationship  got diagnosed last year with a serious uncurable neurological illness with a 5 y life expetancy. 
She has a very controlling and even narcissistic behavior, the kind of person that never leaves anyone else speaking in the room. My partner had confessed feelings supressed from her, and not appreciated as she's always so self centered. Had issue with mental health but never seeked out for specialist's help. So turning ill this behavior has turned more and switched to increased alcohol consumption.
Long story short, this weekend the dad of my partner confessed that he's not only exhausted as a caretaker but also that he thinks their relationship is over romantically maybe 3-5y now - mentioning as one of the reasons his wife s narcissistic behavior. But then he went on to say that he met a female colleague in his new work place (mind he started there 3 y ago)with whom he has a platonic relationship, and that she's supporting him during his hard time (mind he s an introvert with few contacts and his wife has been domineering in this for decades) and he left it fuzzy but probably a crush. My partner could not bear confronting him. 
He insured my partner that he would take care of his wife and would not leave her alone sick.of course he also does not see the point of doing therapy because he s satisfied to talk to his friend he said!! Argh

My partner is devasted. First has to process all this illness from their mom who's loosing her bodily abilities month by month.. and second with these revelations from their dad. Specially since they also saw their dad as closer emotionally parent and could relate on feeling supressed /introverted/mutual hobbies. Im really sorry and sad for this. I think its unfair in way my partner has to deal with all this.. Its so tricky situation feels like from all sides bad.. Should he be honest? She does not deserve this as my partner said.. Im looking for ways to navigate this and be supportive. Im in currently in a process of changing therapist and im really missing this support. Luckily my partner said they want to start. 
TL;DR: how to navigate and support my partner who's mom sick and dad exhausted"
