"[UPDATE 2] BF (30 M) of two years won't do anything (including shower) without my suggestion.

[Update #1](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2mhv6f/update_bf_30_m_of_two_years_wont_do_anything/)

Hi reddit! Idk if anyone is still interested in our story, but I thought I'd send an update. 

It's been a month and my fianc√© has been to therapy. He had a lot of anxiety beforehand, but so far so good. He's also showered almost every day since my last update! 

One morning a couple of weeks ago, he told me that his mother wouldn't allow him to use towels after a shower. Ever. He wouldn't go into much detail, other than to say that she would call him names and tell him he was too filthy to use her towels. So yeah, there are some issues there.

He's also getting food more often now. I was away one day on errands, and when I got back, he said he got some leftovers. He hadn't washed the container yet, and he was worried I'd be angry that he left a dirty bowl in the sink. I guess his mother didn't want him using dishes either. :/

He's been a lot more open with me. He admitted he's pretty severely depressed, and that he's not happy in general. That's what therapy's for I guess, and next month he'll go in for a medication assessment. I think he'll feel a lot better once that gets in place.

Slowly, he's trying to take more chances and trust that I won't resent him for being independent. We still have a long way to go - he is still afraid to take chances in a lot of ways, and I still worry that he can't hold his own in an adult relationship. But he's trying, and he's going to therapy. I told him as long as he was trying, I would stay with him. 

It's probably wishful thinking, but I'd like to think that having someone like me is the incentive/support he needs to be the person he really wants to be. I hope we have a happy ending, because he's the kindest and funniest person I know. If there was ever a kind of person I'd want for my BFF, he's it. 

Thanks for the comments and suggestions, reddit.

tl;dr  He's in the therapy, taking showers, and on the road to recovery. Wish us luck."
