Looking for historic examples of a siege strategy from a video game!,Putrid-Enthusiasm190,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/tqzgy3/looking_for_historic_examples_of_a_siege_strategy/,96,681,"The question rose up from this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bannerlord/comments/tqkbc6/pro_tip/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

For those who are interested, Bannerlord is a RPG/strategy game that takes place in a fictional medieval world loosely based on the Byzantine Empire. The OP shared a strategy that he uses as a wealthy warlord, where he wants to conquer a city, so he first enters the city as a merchant, purchases all the food available and then returns later with his army to lay siege and starve them out quicker. I know cities historically had lots of food reserves, but this still seems like it could be a viable real strategy to shorten a siege. As long as the city merchants had no idea of the ill intentions. Can anyone think of a real world example that worked like this??"
