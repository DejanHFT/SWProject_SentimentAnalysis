Should I go explore hong kong on my overnight connection?,amaljpegs,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/13nfqqp/should_i_go_explore_hong_kong_on_my_overnight/,2,1,So I have a flight back home with hong kong as a connection. My flight arrives in hong kong arrives at 6pm and my flight back home from hong kong leaves at 8am the following morning. Would it be worth it to leave the airport and explore the city for a bit? I'm debating it as it is quite a long stopover. Plus I will have my big camera bag with me with all of my gear.
