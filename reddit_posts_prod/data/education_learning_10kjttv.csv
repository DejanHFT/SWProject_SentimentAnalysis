Looking for sources containing evidence/data driven studying/learning techniques.,JasonNowell,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/10kjttv/looking_for_sources_containing_evidencedata/,5,3,"Hello all!

I am looking into building a study guide for my college-level students. Although I have plenty of anecdotal suggestions, I'm wondering if anyone has any references for studies, papers, or other academically reviewed studies/theories on techniques for studying or learning. I'm primarily looking for things in the academic fields of education, psychology, and/or biology, but I'm open to any credible sources.

As a note, I'm a professional academic, so direct links to research papers or studies are welcome."
