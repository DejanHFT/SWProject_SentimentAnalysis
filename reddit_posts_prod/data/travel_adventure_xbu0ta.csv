Adventurous trip ideas,Revolutionaryrun8,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/xbu0ta/adventurous_trip_ideas/,12,2,"Basically looking for a place, hotel, or group tour company that offers the potential for fun adventurous activities (off-roading, parasailing, boat rides, zip lining, snorkeling/scuba, horseback riding, unqiue hikes, etc.). Nothing to strenuous like backpacking hikes or mountaineering as that’s not quite what we’re after. Anywhere in North America/Caribbean is probably doable. Spent my last vacation by the resort pool the whole time so really looking to change it up.  Budget is ~4k for 2 people. Any suggestions are welcome!"
