"If you watch Godzilla (1998) not for its monster lore but as a critique on the effects of nuclear testing, New York City bureaucracy, failures of the military, and the clear disregard towards nature, it's not half bad.",sage6paths,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/lkhdyy/if_you_watch_godzilla_1998_not_for_its_monster/,104,82,"I am too dumb to convey my thoughts on this subject in written form but I can at least provide some context. Godzilla (1998) was regarded as the worst Godzilla movie to come out. Largely, the reason being that it was not faithful to the history of Godzilla and it's appearance. However, I would interject by saying that if you can get beyond the appearance of this creature in relation to the history of Godzilla, you will find a film that is much deeper than you might realize. It is still an action film so take this with a grain of salt. 

* Effects of nuclear testing. (We are shown the effects of nuclear testing and it's role in the creation of this creature but also the cover-up of the nuclear testing. The deniability of any such effect on the world or its people. In relation to the real world where islanders have been forced off their land for these tests and were never able to return. At the end of the movie, the creature is killed but the real actors have not taken responsibility for its creation and in fact deny their own existence. They create this creature that causes billions in damages and destroy it only to disappear in the wind while leaving a mess for everyone else.)

* New York City bureaucracy (The failure of evacuation or any substantial action in the clear face of danger. Similarities to COVID-19 anyone? You will see a New York Mayor trying to get reelected but using this event as a way to garner votes. In effect costing lives. There are other bureaucratic critiques but I have not watched this movie in a while so please chime in if you know other points.)

*  Failures of the military (The military has known about this creature for some discernible time but fail to take any preventative measures. When the creature makes landfall their one thought is its destruction and not its motivation. It is only half-way through the movie that the military is rational but in effect costing the lives of many people.)

* Clear disregard towards nature (When faced with a cornered animal, that animal will fight twice as hard to survive. This is in relation to both the creature and humans. This movie is a tug of war between the survival of the human species and the beginning of a new species.)

So while this movie took a complete shit on the history of Godzilla, I would say that in comparison to the new Godzilla movies this 1998 movie was at least faithful to the idea of Godzilla. Everyone forgets the 1954 movie was about the effects of the nuclear bomb. The newer Godzilla movies are about big creatures fighting each other (which does have a certain appeal) but this 1998 movie at least brought some real world issues to consider. That is my two cents."
