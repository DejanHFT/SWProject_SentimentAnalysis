Looking for next adventure vacation with the boys,ShibbyShorty,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/z81f63/looking_for_next_adventure_vacation_with_the_boys/,18,5,"So the past few years me and the boys have been going on an annual trip. The group varies between 4-8 guys and we love the vacation to include some adventurous part. We are 30-35 years old. 

So far we have been:
• On a camping / canoe trip in Sweden, sleeping in tents. Starting and ending in the capital (1.5 week).

• On a hike / summit attack on Mt Kenya,  safari and relaxing last few days at the beach. (2 weeks).

• On a hike in the Slovenian mountains (on border with Austria), trekking from cabin to cabin, relaxing last few days at Lake Bled (1 week during lockdown corona).

• On a hike / summit attack on Mt Kazbek, visit wine regions and end the trip at the beach (2 weeks).

• Alpine course in the Alps with an introduction to technical climbing (1.5 week).

During these past few years we bought some essentials for multi day hikes, including a decent rain jacket, rain pants, category D shoes, etc...

Now we are looking for a new adventure and I could really use some advice / tips.

Some factors to keep in mind
• Only have 7 to 8 days for the entire trip (because of kids back home).

• We live in the Netherlands. Both car and plane are option, but we would not prefer a 12 hour flight because of time zone differences. 

• Some of the guys already went hiking in Morroco and Scotland.

• We want to so something that sounds AWESOME, but might include some suffering.

I really hope you can give us tips for our next big trip!"
