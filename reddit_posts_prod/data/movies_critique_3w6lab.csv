"Creative minds at /r/FourHundredBlows welcome your critique, and appreciate it",Ok_Lumberjack,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3w6lab/creative_minds_at_rfourhundredblows_welcome_your/,0,0,"Hey guys.

Six months ago I created a private sub called /r/fourhundredblows, generally for filmmaking critique. Today I've made it public, and animators, VFX artists, motion graphic artists are welcome as well.

We at /r/fourhundredblows focus on one thing: critique, and discussion of the work created by the creative minds of our community. Everyone can be a good critique, provided:

1- He or she kind and thorough.

2- He or she really cares about the subject at hand.

3- He's not a jerk (women aren't jerks on the internet :3)

For the next month or so I will make it my mission to grow /r/fourhundredblows, but it thrives on users. Your critique and submissions are what make this community thrive.

Head to /r/fourhundredblows --- subscribe --- and help until it gets on its feet or just subscribe, and don't post. I bet there's going to be some constructive discussions there.

Thank you."
