Anybody here ever feel over-inspired?,Professional_Humxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/19eqd6z/anybody_here_ever_feel_overinspired/,9,10,"So recently I was suffering from a little writer's block, so I went and watched the stuff that gets me motivated to write (I write movies and TV shows) but now all my ideas seem more and more like what I've watched and it just makes me feel fucking terrible. Where are all my ideas!?!?!? All my ideas seem half assed and cheap, and none of them will ever live up to the stuff I watch. I used to get good ideas, now I get fake ones. What do I do?????"
