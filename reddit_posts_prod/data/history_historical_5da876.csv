"Forrest Gump tells the story of a ""slow-witted"" yet simple man, who serendipitously witnesses and directly and positively impacts many historical events, from sports to war to politics to business to disease, etc. Has anybody in history accidentally ""Forrest Gumped"" their way into history?",creedofwheat,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5da876/forrest_gump_tells_the_story_of_a_slowwitted_yet/,2323,14270,"Particularly unrelated historical events such as the many examples throughout the novel or book. A nobody whose meer presence or interaction influenced more than one historical event. Any time frame.

Also, not somebody that witness two or more unrelated events, but somebody that partook, even if it was like Forrest peaking in as the first black students integrated Central High School, somehow becoming an Alabama kick returner or how he got on the Olympic ping-pong team because he got shot in the butt.  #JustGumpedIn
