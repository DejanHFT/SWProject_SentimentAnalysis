Which type stain (oil gel or water) is gotta use to achieve this look for my desk,ajak6,https://i.redd.it/ddv43ih5qacc1.jpeg,9,4,"I saw this color of table top at ikea. I have a similar table top in raw maple color and similar pattern. I want to achieve this look how do i do it?
I sand and then apply which type of stain? 
Then apply which polyurethane ?

Optionally it would be good if any of the stain type has a better property pf removal by sanding in case i want to change color in the future. I read some are penetrating stains, will they make my life difficult if i want to change color in future?"
