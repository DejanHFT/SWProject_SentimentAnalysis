"My (30) GF (27) Taking ED Personally, Not Supportive",nightstar360,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/190bkfy/my_30_gf_27_taking_ed_personally_not_supportive/,19,0,"I had issues getting it up and keeping it up in my past relationship but wrote it off to other issues with her. This time, it became evident there is something going on whether it is mental and/or physical. Started the first time we got intimate. I immediately went to the doctor, got on testosterone shots and trying Viagra. Reassured my GF she is super attractive and I like her.

I get semi hard when giving her oral, cuddling, grinding, etc. but when I try to penetrate, I am.not hard enough. I get creative but she instantly wants me to just fuck her. She hasn't asked ""what can I do to help?"" Or anything of that sort.

I recently got some cock rings to try. Well when we were recently intimate (I was not feeling well - coughing and blowing nose - but she did not care tbh) I was semi hard and getting close to cumming against her body when she got up for me to mount her. I said get the cock ring because it was in her nightstand, she said ""I want you to just fuck me"" so I tried without and got the same result. Very dehumanizing as she treats my actual issue that I am trying to resolve for us as a choice. She believes if she just keeps saying ""fuck me"" I will just get over it.

I told her to let me know if it is too much (and we just need to break up) she said she will, that it has been hard. Said she knows it is for me too but ""for her it brings up insecurities"" again insinuating it does not do the same for me. The difference is I am trying to reassure her. She feels like the value I place on her is connected solely with the hardness of my cock. Should I just break up with her now?

TDLR - My GF is not being supportive of my ED issue, should I break it off"
