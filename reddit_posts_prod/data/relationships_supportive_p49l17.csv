Single Mom [65F] is asking for my financial support [30M],Captainyargg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/p49l17/single_mom_65f_is_asking_for_my_financial_support/,128,110,"\-------------- Situation

My mother's situation is pretty deep. She's got two mortgages on her home, recently invested over 50% of her savings into a restaurant business that's not going to make profit for at least half a year, and a bunch of smaller debts.

She's asking for about 1,000-1,500$ a month for about a year while she works to build up her business.

\-------------- Option 1

I'm financially independent and live alone, but I'm not so well off to *comfortably* support another life. But If I become super frugal, I believe I could squeeze out about $1,000 to send her each month, leaving me the bare minimum+Internet for survival. (I am single and do not have any SO or kids to take care of)

\-------------- Option 2

I have the option to instead, live in her home again to reduce my personal bills and then do it. The thing is... she's not a comfortable person to live with; If she wasn't my mother, I would want nothing to do with her. Also, I would be reduced to only having a ""room"" and not a ""place"" for $1,000+ a month.

\-------------- TL;DR

**TL;DR! Mom needs help; My options are to move in with her and help pay bills or adopt a super frugal life style so I can send her money.** Both lower my quality of life quite a bit, and I'm hoping there could be some other option/s I haven't thought of.

Any opinions would be much appreciated."
