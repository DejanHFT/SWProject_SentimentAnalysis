Who is your favourite literary anti-hero?,MattySevenSix,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7hgr7q/who_is_your_favourite_literary_antihero/,81,43,"Most readers love a good hero, be it D'Artagnan, King Arthur, Edmond Dantes, Jack Ryan, Jack Reacher, Harry Potter, or even P.G. Wodehouse's Jeeves. But, I want to know who, if any, are your favourite anti-heroes? Who is so bad they're good? Who doesn't follow the rules, and wins your heart as a result thereof?

I can kick this off, as anti-heroes are indeed my favourite protagonists...

#1 - Ignatious J. Reilly (A Confederacy of Dunces)
#2 - Arthur Bandini (The Road to Los Angles)
#3 - Henry Chinaski (Post Office)
#4 - Bruno Dante (Chump Change)"
