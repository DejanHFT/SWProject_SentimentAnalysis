Well-read Wednesdays. An act to counter moronic Mondays. ,Noedel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/p6174/wellread_wednesdays_an_act_to_counter_moronic/,87,130,"Ever since /f/fitness changed to self based posts, there has been a decline in external content on the site. A lot of interesting reads get lost in the comment section, and people seem to have a hard time determining whether their post is a repost or not. 

Yesterday, I pitched the [idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/p4do4/weekly_articleliterature_discussion_thread) to make a weekly literature/article review thread. I got quite some positive responses. Some people want to share their knowledge, others want to verify the accuracy of articles they've read. Both are welcome here. 

So it shall be. I present you **""Well-read Wednesdays""** (suggestions for a less-cheesy name are still welcome). Every week, I shall give a popular subject on which articles can be submitted. This can be everything from diet to back pains, from training routines to sleeping habits, etc.

-----------------------

**This weeks topic**


Since this is the first edition, I would like to ask you: **what is the one fitness related article/book you think everyone should have read?** Of course, we all know Starting Strength, but what else do you think should be basic knowledge?

-----------------

**Guidelines**


* The subject is just a general direction. You can also bring in other interesting reads if you like.

* Try to give a tl;dr of the article that you found.

* You can send in an article to share, but also ask for the validity of an article you're unsure about. Make this clear in your post. 

* Please respect each-others opinion. They will differ. Try to be a scholar and a gentleman/women.

**Meta**


As this is my first Well-read Wednesday post, please do not refrain from giving feed-back. Also, english is not my native language, so I excuse my self for the grammatical errors I've probably made. Also, since I'm not from the US: what is the best time to launch my article?



**Edit:** Thank you all for your submissions! It looks like a succes, next week I'll give a quick shortlist of popular articles, and introduce a new theme.
