Anyone use a vibrating roller? Curious how well they work.,beingmetoday,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ca7kk6/anyone_use_a_vibrating_roller_curious_how_well/,11,8,Seems like a great idea to help handle tough spots yet they are a little expensive. Anyone have good results? Is it worth the money?
