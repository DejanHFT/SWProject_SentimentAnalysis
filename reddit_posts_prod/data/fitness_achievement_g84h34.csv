Need to achieve below 16 min 2 Mile,Maverick_mca,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/g84h34/need_to_achieve_below_16_min_2_mile/,21,4,"
I’ve been doing C25K, currently on week three. Some days I do my own “program” which is generally a walking mile (16 minutes) and a running/walking mile (12 minutes) and a cool down mile (20 minutes). My current time is over twenty minutes for two mile run (and I can’t fully run all of it).
I do a daily routine of lunges, side steps, squats as well (among other workouts besides legs/cardio)
I’m trying to get a sub 16 minute 2 mile time for my army OCS application. 

Edit to add- I’m female, 5 ft tall, ~110lbs 

Tips? Advice? Am I running too fast and wearing myself out- I noticed my heart rate when running is 180-200. I read on here it should be 180-my age which would be well below that heart rate."
