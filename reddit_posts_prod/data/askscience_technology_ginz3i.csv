"If solar cells turn the sun's energy into electricity, do solar cells reduce heat that would otherwise be absorbed by the ground?",Mooseman1020,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ginz3i/if_solar_cells_turn_the_suns_energy_into/,328,4445,"For example, what is the impact of 1sq meter of solar panels versus 1sq meter of sunlight on regular ground in regards to thermal energy. Does solar efficiency play a role?

Lots of articles talk about how polar caps are important for reflecting incoming sunlight back into space. I was wondering how some of the technologies and materials we place outside affect the net thermal energy captured by the planet.

So controlling other variables (weather, greenhouse gases, etc.) what impact do these types of materials have on warming the planet? In the extreme, would a planet completely covered in solar panels be a different temperature than one that does not?


Edit: Thank you everyone for your detailed and informative responses! Tons of great information and additional topics to research. I hope others found this interesting as well."
