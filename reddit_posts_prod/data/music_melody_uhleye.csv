Romantic-Sweet-cute melodies with beats?,thrwaway9595,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/uhleye/romanticsweetcute_melodies_with_beats/,0,2,"hey everyone, how’s it going? 

I’m looking for some romantic sweet cute melodies/songs with fast beats (example below). I wanted to surprise my SO with a reel of our marriage pictures. 


Recently i’ve heard “as it was” by harry styles getting very popular on reels, and their was intro of “tiny light” by akari kito. 


Help me out please! I’ll appreciate it! Thank you!"
