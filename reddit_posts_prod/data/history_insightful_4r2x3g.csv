"Hoping that r/todayilearned thread about ""stone-age"" Aboriginal Australian people pre-colonization is wrong.",mecurdius,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/4r2x3g/hoping_that_rtodayilearned_thread_about_stoneage/,78,66,"https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/4r1hbs/til_australia_remained_in_the_stone_age_until/

Most of the discussion on here seems either racist or just people making stuff up. I haven't studied Australian indigenous culture/technologies but I would imagine that there are contributions that aren't captured in this discussion. An analogy would be Native American contributions to agriculture. Any resources or insights you can share?"
