"What is Stephen King's most ""literary"" work?",little_chupacabra89,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rq5aap/what_is_stephen_kings_most_literary_work/,119,36,"So, I just finished Pet Sematary and, if I'm honest, couldn't wait to be done.

This book had such moments of brilliance! The early discussions on death and faith were really quite mature and thoughtful. And then, conversely, there were moments where I thought, why the hell is this included?
Some of the references felt really cheap and cheesy. Also, some of the inner dialogue felt completely unnecessary and, what is this wise guy snark that King adopts in his writing, or was that just Louis? I guess it was supposed to be the character, but it just rang false. 

I've read King before. I loved 11/22/63 when in my mid twenties. In high school I read Salem's Lot and The Stand, the latter of which felt like a true reading event.

Anyway, back to the topic at hand. I know what King is, for the most part, but some colleagues and friends really stand by him (no pun intended). Pet Sematary was one that I thought would knock my socks off. I found it mediocre at best. 

What is King's most ""literary"" or best work? Which has the best writing, the best characterization, the best plotting, and the most mature storytelling?"
