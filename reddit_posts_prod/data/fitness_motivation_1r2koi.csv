Here's mine: I'll start. My entire reason for trying to get into shape was that I was in love with a girl. She was my everything, but she stopped caring about me when I gained my weight. At first, I did it to win her back, I wanted her so fucking bad. Then I realized she didn't love me, for me. She loved the image I portrayed. Now I'm losing weight for me...and kinda to rub it in her face."
