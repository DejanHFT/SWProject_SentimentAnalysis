Building a well-rounded athlete.,BobbyNineThousand,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1ztfog/building_a_wellrounded_athlete/,21,6,"I am a skinnyfat guy who has been seriously hitting the gym only for about three months now. I'm eating super clean, lots of protein, no crap. Losing weight and lifting iron. Getting lean and strong. 

I've been thinking a lot about a serious program. I've read the FAQ several times, and you guys have taught me so much. 

I was watching some clips of the NFL combine -- and it struck me that I want to train for athleticism. 

I don't just want to lift heavy, or get big for aesthetics. I want to be able to lift, to run for a while, to sprint -- maybe even change directions quickly, or jump high. 

So how do you train for that general sort of athleticism. I'm in the gym five days a week; doing cardio for an hour and lifting for an hour. Trying to be smart about it.  I'm not really able to take up a sport at the moment though -- I just want that well-rounded athleticism, without all the sport-specific training and obligation to a team. 

TL;DR -- how do I become a well-rounded athlete?"
