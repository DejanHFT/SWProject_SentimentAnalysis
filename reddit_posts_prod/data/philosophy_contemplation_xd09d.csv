How can things exist?,Redditjinn,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/xd09d/how_can_things_exist/,51,5,"To me this is the fundamental question, bar none. There was a recent post in philosophy about logic being subordinate to God. This kind of thinking, that logic is surmountable, that it can be imperfect, gains an indirect validation in my opinion, because the very foundation of logic, the existence of things, cannot be explained. Everything logical suggests that everything is caused by something. When this is applied to the universe we have an endless chain of cause and effect going back into infinity, with no starting point. It is an endless chain of effects for which we can contemplate no root cause because we can always go back one degree further. Instead, some draw a line at say, the big bang, and then work on from there. How unsatisfying is this? That we just choose a point along this chain and direct all our energies into figuring what caused everything from there on? It's as arbitrary as trying to find out how everything works from last Tuesday onwards.

Surely in the logically perfect world there would be nothing, therefore there is no reason to prove anything. The fact that we are here, that things exist is  illogical, or illogical in respect to the logic we use, suggesting the logic we use is imperfect.

we can't draw definate conclusions from this, i know, but surely it does cast doubt about the absoluteness of logic. Sometimes it seems that all the thinkings of man is limited to a sort of play pen where everything makes sense, and beyond it there is this untapped super-logic which, if we were to master it, would render the universe complete, bringing down the veil, ending all argument, causing our limited minds to truly know how it is that we exist. Surely this is the answer we have always searched for, some of us satisfying ourselves with non-answers, others resigned to contemplate it no more. It is always there, such an easy question, one that we can be asked by an infant and yet not even the oldest or wisest of us can answer it. Why is this? What are we missing?"
