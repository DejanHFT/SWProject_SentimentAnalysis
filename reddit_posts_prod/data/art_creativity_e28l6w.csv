my creativity is gone and time is running out,musical_fanatic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/e28l6w/my_creativity_is_gone_and_time_is_running_out/,7,2,"16f, sophomore in high school. I wanna go to an art college but I feel I won't be good enough to even get in. I have very strong insecurities in my work and my depression kills my creativity on a regular basis. I really wanna be an artist but sometimes I feel like it's something I should give up on. Any tips or advice on how to pull through?"
