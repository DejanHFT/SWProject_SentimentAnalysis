Weird Water Filter Nozzle auto-off valve question.,cwfeldmann,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1869v5s/weird_water_filter_nozzle_autooff_valve_question/,3,1,"We have an under sink water filter. I installed it myself so I'm somewhat familiar with the plumbing needed. I got to thinking after seeing a [Steve Mould video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT2KhJ8W-Kg) talking about venturi pump valves used in Gas pumps. Is there anything like this or could be DIYed for our water filter? I've done some initial searching but not able to find a product to achieve it.

I've been wishing for something for the small piping under my sink. We often fill our large water bottles and gallon jugs to eventually pour into our pet's water bowl. I'd love to start filling and walk away to do another task without having to put the bottles in the sink, specifically when I've drained the tank and the reverse osmosis pump is slowing down the flow of water. Mainly, I'd like to start filling up my dog's larger water bowl reservoir but also.

Sorry if this isn't the place to ask this but thought the DIY nature of this might fit. Thanks and Cheers."
