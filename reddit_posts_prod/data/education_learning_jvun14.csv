Discovery Learning is no better than Direct Instruction.,rmurphe,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/jvun14/discovery_learning_is_no_better_than_direct/,51,72,"
It seems like research is starting to show that discovery learning is no better than direct instruction, and maybe in some cases worse because students can lack focus and direction or because of how much time discovery learning takes.   

Anecdotally I agree.  Its an interesting idea but from what I have seen it doesn’t seem to work very well.    

I’d love to hear from others especially if you can point to research supporting the stance you take.

Edit: several people asked for the research.  I first read several articles in the past during my masters degree which I don’t have access to unfortunately anymore.   Also it has apprared in several books I have read.  Make it Stick.  Psychology every teacher should know are two That come to mind.  Most recently though I read this blog.  Research is attached to it.
