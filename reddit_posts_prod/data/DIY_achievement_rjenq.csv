DIY may be able to answer this...how do I achieve this Tuscan paint style for my wall?,clark_ent,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/rjenq/diy_may_be_able_to_answer_thishow_do_i_achieve/,9,2,"Hey everyone! I was at a restaurant, and decided I really want to replicate this look. How would you go about applying those patterns (it's not wall paper)? From the look of it, it was painted first with the midtone, then some how applied a darker and lighter shade. How would you go about applying those extra shades?
