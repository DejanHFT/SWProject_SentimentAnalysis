"I'm pregnant, and the guy I'm seeing is being not so supportive. He is pro-life (like a leader in Students For Life), but basically encouraging me to have an abortion. I'm so stressed, and scared, and don't know what to do. ",Redlaces2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18axph/im_pregnant_and_the_guy_im_seeing_is_being_not_so/,374,383,"I'm 19f and he is 23m. We've been seeing each other for four months in like this vague not FWB but not Bf/Gf way. Its alright and we seem to be happy, so I haven't pushed it. He is pretty busy too, and I don't think in the place for a relationship. 

I don't want to get into it in too much detail, but the birth control method we were using failed, and I found out I'm pregnant a few days ago. I told him right after I found out, and he was kind of irritated and told me to make sure I was actually pregnant. So, I waited another day and after another positive test told him.

He starts to FREAK OUT. About how he can't have this right now, and how I lied to him about birth control. He said a lot of things, some of which I'm sure he regrets. He basically called me a whore (which I'm *not*... I've only slept with 3 guys ever), and said since we weren't dating he has no idea whose baby it could be. He hasn't told me have an abortion exactly, but he has made me feel like shit for being pregnant. 

Now this is the part that is confusing to me. When we first met, we met because he was friends with a very goody two shoes, republican friend of mine. They were in a few organizations together, and he is really strongly pro-Life. Like to the point where I've seen him get in hour long debates with friends of mine, and he can be pretty persuasive. He is in law school, and he is a really smart guy. I've always been kind of torn about it, but I would say I am more pro-life than pro-choice. 

I don't have many people I can to turn too who won't judge. He hasn't answered a single text in two days, and I don't know who to go to. I can't go to my family, and my friends wouldn't understand. They don't even know we've been sleeping together. 

tl;dr Slept with a boy in like an unofficial relationship. Accidental pregnancy and now he is being so unsupportive. Oh yeah, he is pro-life too, but basically telling me to have an abortion. "
