Thinking of Majoring in History,calben_fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/g72eee/thinking_of_majoring_in_history/,66,40,"So a couple months ago, I got accepted into the University that I applied for. I had applied for English with a co-degree with Education, and have so far been accepted in the English part of my major (haven’t heard back from the Education department at the school as they are waiting for my final grades). Although I really enjoy English, I’ve also enjoyed learning about History. I’ve always enjoyed video games that have a historical aspect to it, games similar to Assassin’s Creed in which take place during historical events, and have always enjoyed learning about past wars and changes in society. I’m thinking of either changing my major to History, or doing a double major in English and History because both interest me a lot.

I’m hoping to look for some advice on what I should do, and maybe some insight on the experience one has while majoring in History. What are the pros and cons of majoring in history? What do the assessments look like (are there a lot of tests or is it more focused on papers?)"
