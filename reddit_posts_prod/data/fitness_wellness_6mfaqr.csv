How well do bent over rows translate to pendlay rows?,eFeqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6mfaqr/how_well_do_bent_over_rows_translate_to_pendlay/,35,47,"Guys who have done both, how much do you put on the bar for your working sets for both exercises? I'm currently doing 3x12 92,5kg (200lbs) bent over row and was wondering how does that weight translate to a pendlay row. 

Thanks"
