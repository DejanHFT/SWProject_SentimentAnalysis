Rant- Dear youtubers/bloggers: a review is NOT summarising every detail of the plot and making the odd observation,darkamyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fngiyv/rant_dear_youtubersbloggers_a_review_is_not/,2643,36304,"I am getting so sick and tired of this, it used to be a youtube problem but now it's spreading to blogs and even review sites like denofgeek. Basically the typical youtube ""review"" is about 20mins long and consists of the host describing the entire plot from start to finish and often garnishing this with a few clips if it's an older movie. It's basically like watching MST3K or Elvira but instead of getting to watch the movie they just tell you what's happening and make a few comments. Then the only thing that is actually a review is about 30 seconds at the end where they say if they think it's good or bad. So in general there is no point watching a youtube ""review"" unless you have either seen the movie already or have no intention of watching it and just want to watch someone tell you what happens. The weird thing is that they're insanely popular- apparently millions of people want to watch a random person on a couch telling them what happens in a movie without watching it. I'm not saying all youtubers are like this- most who cover brand new releases like Chris Stuckmann or Jeremy Jahns do a really good job giving a concise non-spoilery review. 

This is spreading onto review sites as well. I was reading denofgeek the other day for a review of an individual episode and it was literally a summary of what happened and then a small paragraph at the bottom saying that they liked it. Now they have started giving spoiler warnings on some shows like Dr Who but the ""review"" before the spoiler warning is basically saying how they can't/don't know how to review it without giving spoilers."
