Squat Achievement!!,MastrM,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/21up76/squat_achievement/,2,0,"Been doing PHAT for a few weeks meow.

I started at about 225lbs - 3x5.  (Wanted to perfect ATG.  I've always had hip mobility issues from Hockey)

I've FINALLY broken 300lbs in a short 3 weeks, maintaining good form. =D

Awesome!

fyi - I'm 6'2"", 220lbs, 25 y/o."
