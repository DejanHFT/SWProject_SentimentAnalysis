G Adventures/Intrepid Turkey Tour,Ok_Calligrapher6132,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/v5m2yv/g_adventuresintrepid_turkey_tour/,18,4,"Looking into doing the 18-30 somethings G Adventures trip to Turkey (coastlines and kebabs) in September. Any chance anyone has done this trip before and can comment on how it was? Also considering the equivalent tour through Intrepid. If you’ve had a favorite trip through either of those companies, would also love to hear about it as I’m open to different itineraries/countries. Thanks in advance!"
