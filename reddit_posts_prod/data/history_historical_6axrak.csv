My imaginary bottle of Canadian Club is handy and I am ready to start.

0.05: Badhistory 5 seconds in! The narrator calls the Celt a savage barbarian. First, that applies only to those from Scotland. Second, the Celts had complex social and religious structures such as ruling councils and assemblies where free citizens could take part in government, as well as refined artistic traditions and a strong sense of loyalty to their aristocratic patrons or officials. There was nothing barbaric or savage about them. DRINK!

0.10: That maille looks way to anachronistic. The maille used in the time period would have looked like this:

The maille displayed looks more medieval:

DRINK!

1.21: The narrator states the Celts were the ancestors of the Scottish and Irish clans. He also leaves out they were the ancestors of the French, English, Bretons and Welsh, as well as a large proportion of the Spanish and North Italian population. One drink for the overly narrow statement. DRINK!

1.22: The ""stats"" of the Celtic warrior don't mention they would wear maille. DRINK!

1.23: HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELD! DRINK!

1.27: Metal helmet with nose-guard many centuries before they became common. DRINK!

1.33: Two errors here. First, the narrator calls the Persian Immortal a special-ops killer. Disregarding the fact that the Immortals were most likely called Companions (Anûšiya as opposed to Anauša), the Immortals were an army of full-time troops intended to fight in open battle, not a small group of men who would operate behind enemy lines. Next, the ""stats"" list them as having a wicker shield, as opposed to a wooden shield that a Persian professional unit would usually possess. Wicker shields were employed to form a shield wall, and not for guard duty. DRINK! 

2.40: HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!
2.47: MORE HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!

2.52: Time to roll out the ""experts"". The first is Francis Brebner. Extraordinarily fit looking guy and a participant in Highland games, he may have the athletic ability but has no background in martial-arts or experimental archaeology. DRINK!

3.17: The next person is Spencer Dinnean, whom I could find absolutely no information about. DRINK!

3.42: The narrator says the Celts were the first iron-workers in Europe and helped usher in the Iron Age. Uh, no. That would be the Greeks, and the Iron-Age was transmitted from the Middle-East, not heralded by the Celts. DRINK!

3.46: The narrator says that iron helped the Celts conquer much of Europe. Again, no. Celtic culture was spread through a variety of methods. Migration seems to be the most attested to within written sources, but trade and acculturation to a new elite may have also been methods. DRINK!

3.59: The Celtic noble is not wearing maille. DRINK!

4.14: HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELD! DRINK!

4.51: The first Iranian expert is Ardeshir ""Bitches be nothing next to sharp akinakes"" Radpour. Now we are getting somewhere! Mr Radpor is a trained rider, martial-artist and experimental archaeologist. He is also a metal smith and has crafted numerous weapons and armour. His website can be found here:

http://www.radpour.com/

This has earned The ByzantineBasileus Seal of Approval (tm).

5.02: Mr Radpour called the Immortals special-forces. The ByzantineBasileus Seal of Approval (tm) withdrawn. Also, DRINK!

5.17: The next individual is Cyrus Zahiri, also known as Cyrus James, who appears to be only an actor and occasional film crewmen. DRINK!

5.28: The shape of the shields here is correct, but they are held in the wrong manner. They are held horizontally rather than vertically, meaning the warriors lose the protection offered to their lower and upper bodies. DRINK!

5.59: The Immortals were infantry, and did not use chariots. DRINK!

5.52: The narrator says the Persian scythed chariot would destroy any resistance. Most of the accounts of scythed chariots describe them as total failures when facing troops who were prepared for them. DRINK!

6.09: The narrator states that the Immortals numbered ten thousand. This figure comes from Herodotus, but I personally doubt his description is accurate. I would propose that the ""Immortals"" where a guard unit of 1000 men with golden apples on their spears. The amount of 10,000 should perhaps refer to the standing palace regiments as a whole, who were called the Companions.

6.31: HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!

6.46: STILL MORE HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!

7.03: The narrator calls the Celtic sword a long-sword, which was a specific weapon from the medieval period. DRINK!

7.10: Francis Brebner states the Celtic sword had a rounded point whilst holding a version of the weapon with a relatively narrow point. DRINK!

9.05: Francis swings at the armour instead of thrusting under the scales. DRINK!

10.17: Test is done against a bare head, whilst an Immortal would have been most likely been wearing a helmet. DRINK!

11.19: Narrator calls the Immortal a commando. DRINK!

12.15: The narrator says an ancient Celtic warrior would have had a burda, which was a club. I have never read about the burda being used by the ancient Celts, so I will count this as an error. DRINK!

13.19: This test proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that a sharp iron point can penetrate flesh.

14.03: Francis suggest a leather belt as protection for a Celtic warrior rather than, you know, MAILLE! DRINK!

14.28: That belt looks less like a belt and more like a girdle. For when your warrior wants to look svelte on the battlefield!

14.59: I am sure a Celtic warrior would not just let you pull down his shield like that, especially with him holding it and trying to cut you in the spleen. DRINK!

16.48: ANOTHER OCCASION OF HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING!

17.17: MORE SHIELDS HELD INCORRECTLY IN A BATTLE-LINE! DRINK!

17.33: Not only are their shields held inproperly, they wield their spears in a manner that actually prevents them attacking with it! Double drink. DRINK! DRINK!

17.39: Sigh. More Hollywood Dual-Wielding. DRINK!

17.45: ""Coming up! Both sides thrust their most piercing weapons!"". Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe.

18.44: Francis states that Celtic spear-heads were wavy in shape. In reality they were leaf-shaped:

DRINK!

19.27: They are testing a Celtic spear by throwing it, rather than using it hand-to-hand. DRINK!
