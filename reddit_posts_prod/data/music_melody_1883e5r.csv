Was the melody of a 2000s American piano pop-punk song influenced by a 1980 British jangle pop song?,Delicious_Adeptness9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1883e5r/was_the_melody_of_a_2000s_american_piano_poppunk/,0,0,"Listening to some old British and Irish rock in honor of the late Shane MacGowan, and Squeeze's ""Pulling Mussels"" came on.  
My ears perked up, because when Glenn Tilbrook sings ""pulling mussels from the shell..."", I thought it sounded like the refrain in ""I Woke Up in a Car"". Am I crazy??
