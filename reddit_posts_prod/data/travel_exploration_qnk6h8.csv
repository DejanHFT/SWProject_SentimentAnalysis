Exploring Naples,nicecockbro678,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/qnk6h8/exploring_naples/,19,4,"Hello there!! I am from a pretty poor european country and want to celebrate the anniversary with my boyfriend in Naples. We don't have much money, but we will try to survive there! Can someone tell me which are the best places to explore? We thought about Pompeii, Vesuvius and Herculaneum :)))
Also, how is the street food??"
