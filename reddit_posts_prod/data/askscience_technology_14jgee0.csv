"AskScience AMA Series: I'm Chris Ferrie, a writer, researcher, and lecturer on all things quantum physics! Ask me anything!",AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/14jgee0/askscience_ama_series_im_chris_ferrie_a_writer/,309,1112,"I'm an Associate Professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Centre for Quantum Software and Information (UTS:QSI), where I lecture on and research quantum information, control, and foundations. However, I'm better known even amongst my colleagues as the author of ""Quantum Physics for Babies,"" which has been translated into twenty languages and has over a million readers worldwide!

Recently, I started writing for older audiences with ""Where Did The Universe Come From? And Other Cosmic Questions"" and ""Quantum Bullsh*t: How To Ruin Your Life With Advice From Quantum Physics."" My next book is ""42 Reasons To Hate The Universe: And One Reason Not To."" Though it won't be released until 2024, my co-authors and I have already started a complementary podcast for it.

Ask me anything! (I'll be answering questions from my morning in Australia at **4PM EDT (6 AM AEST June 27th, 20 UT)**.)
