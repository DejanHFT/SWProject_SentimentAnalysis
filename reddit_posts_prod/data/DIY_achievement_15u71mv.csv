Please Help! At my wits end trying to figure out how to mount this TV,chilled2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/15u71mv/please_help_at_my_wits_end_trying_to_figure_out/,40,14,"I really like my house. BUT it's got one of those old ""TV nooks"" that absolutely won't fit a TV larger than 55'.  

Here's the infamous mantel.

It was suggested I attempt to mount a larger TV  (65') on my mantle. ""Ok"" I think to myself. ""simple matter buying a pull down mount"" similar to this.  [MantelMount MM540 Enhanced Above Fireplace Pull Down TV Mount](https://www.mantelmount.com/collections/mounts/products/mm540-enhanced-mount) 

Seems like a great idea. Rather than straining your neck, you can pull the tv over the mantel and get it to eye level. 

Turns out it's not simple at all. the ""alcove"" that is above the mantle is DEEP .We're talking 15' deep. What that means is that the mount has to be placed much higher than you normally would want to put it in order to clear the 15inch mantel lip. That means the arch above wouldn't be able to accommodate a 65"" tv height based on how high I would have to mount.

Any suggestions or products I could use to get this done? I'm relatively handy, but I can't think of how I can achieve this.

Much, MUCH appreciated.
