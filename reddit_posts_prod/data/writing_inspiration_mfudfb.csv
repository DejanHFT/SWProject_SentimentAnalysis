Plagiarism vs Inspiration?,punknprncss,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/mfudfb/plagiarism_vs_inspiration/,3,2,"This has been a burning question, I know the concept of public domain for taking book ideas, anything in public domain is free to re-work/re-create. But there seems to be lately books/movies that are inspired by other works - the obvious of Twilight/50 Shades of Grey (the After Series fitting a bit in there but maybe not as obvious), Harry Potter being very similar in storylines to Star Wars.

What is the fine line between plagiarism and taking ideas or concept but then making it your own?

As an example: The Breakfast Club, if I wanted to write a story about a bunch of kids stuck in detention together (concept of Breakfast Club) but everything that happened after that was different, does this become a legal issue or because the rest of the story is new, it is then ok?"
