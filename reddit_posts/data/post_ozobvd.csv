Is it possible to to model and predict COVID-19 variants and their effects ahead of time?,mindloss,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ozobvd/is_it_possible_to_to_model_and_predict_covid19/,5,0,"And if so, is anyone working on it?

I keep reading news all the time like, say, DeepMind's fantastic success recently with using AI to predict protein folding to roughly atomic accuracy. I don't know biology, really, but I gathered that was a big deal.

So I wonder: do we still lack the tech and/or knowledge to randomly explore the state space of potential COVID-19 mutations and be able to have a good enough guess at their characteristics that we could flag potential problematic variants for further review? Even if the prohibitive factor is the enormous range of possible mutations, I'd think a random search would be still be useful inasmuch as that's how the actual disease operates, so it could at least hint at which variants are particularly likely to emerge.

And it seems like it would be nice to know whether any real monsters are lurking around the corner, if such a thing were possible. If it's not currently possible, why not?"
