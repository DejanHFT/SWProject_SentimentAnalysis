My views on the future of smartphones. Is smartphone innovation coming to an end?,Spartan9442,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/crti4h/my_views_on_the_future_of_smartphones_is/,30,2,"I feel like smartphone’s are so advanced now, that how much more can they get better? 

For Apple, as an example, they slowly add tiny upgrades each year. In 2020 I see them possibly releasing a notch less iPhone. Then maybe a micro-led display in 2022. Better camera each year. Then 2024? A foldable display possibly. They’ll introduce S versions for each version in between the major releases which will be the same thing with small internal upgrades.

After that though, what’s next?  How much more can they bring out? We will soon have a bezel-less display, probably a 120 hz microled, foldable into something bigger like an iPad mini, great cameras, and in-screen fingerprint scanner. The internals are already so advanced and powerful, at which point does it become redundant to keep increasing the specs? How much more can smartphones do?

I know AR is probably going to be the next big thing. I think in 2025 or is when we’ll actually see pretty useful and everyday applications of it. Also I don’t think smartphones are the best medium for AR. Who wants to hold up a smartphone camera every time they want to use it? I think in 2027-2029 smart glasses will start to become the norm and replace smartphones. Where we will always be connected to hud.

What do you think is the future of our smartphones?"
