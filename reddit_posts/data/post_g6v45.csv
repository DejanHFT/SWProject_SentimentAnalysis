"Help, we got robbed, got the robbers IP Address",SliverB,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g6v45/help_we_got_robbed_got_the_robbers_ip_address/,822,652,"Hi Reddit, I have seen you do amazing things and i was hoping you could help.

We got  burglarized *edit - not robbed* 2 days ago and the robber took my roommates laptop, phone and wallet. I think i have nothing missing. I have not actually been home to do a full search. 

We have called the cops and they are on it, but we were wondering if theres something else we could do to get this person faster.

The robber was a genius and decided to use the stolen laptop before wiping anything on it, which is good for us. My roommate had dropbox running and it showed that a sync happened quite a few times from the robber's IP address - *EDIT* ip taken down. (its comcast and its in boston)

We have sent this to the detective on our case, but its been 2 days and nothing. Is there anything we can do to get this person asap please?

Thank you reddit

TLDR; - Got burglarized *edit - not robbed*, Got robber's ip address (thanks to dropbox), What can i do to get this guy faster?

EDIT 1- WOW, didnt expect to reach front page. Thank you guys. I will post updates in a few hours, once roommate wakes up and we try your suggestions. 

EDIT 2 - To clarify, he didnt loose his complete thesis. Just the latest copy of it. During the day, he crunched some data and wrote up some results. Just found out he has already bought a new laptop, recover what he can from his latest time machine backup, reacquired the data and redid it. Now its all about the principles. 

EDIT 3 - We have contacted comcast about the situation and also notified the detective. They told us they are on it and now we wait. Thank you very much reddit

EDIT 4 - Well dropbox is still updating the same ip for the computer - seems the person has gotten very comfortable with it - hopefully they do something soon about it"
