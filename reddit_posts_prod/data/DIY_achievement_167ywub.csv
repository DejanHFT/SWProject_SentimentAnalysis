Seeking Advice: Uneven Oil Absorption on Sanded Coffee Table - How to Fix?,Fendrbud,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/167ywub/seeking_advice_uneven_oil_absorption_on_sanded/,1,1,"I managed to make a noticeable mark on my coffee table, so I decided to sand it down with a machine and reapply linseed oil.

However, I'm struggling to get a good result now, as it seems like the oil is being absorbed unevenly into the wood (see picture). How can I achieve a good result here?
