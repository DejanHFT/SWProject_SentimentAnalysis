**Reviews**

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-jason-momoa-james-wan-1235767228/):

>Even the actors seem worn out by the ridiculousness of this sequel.

[Deadline] (https://deadline.com/2023/12/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-review-james-wan-struggles-anchor-cartoonish-sequel-1235678398/):

>Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom struggles with inconsistent character portrayal, subpar CGI, and a lack of narrative direction.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-review-jason-momoa-patrick-wilson-amber-heard-1235848235/):

>The movie, with all that combat, is staged on an impressively grand scale by the returning director, James Wan, but at the same time there’s something glumly standard about it.

[AV Club](https://www.avclub.com/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-review-1851116790) (B):

>This is a film that takes big swing after big swing, and leaves us filled up with spectacle, warmth, and a sense that the wait was probably worth it.

[The Playlist](https://theplaylist.net/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-review-superhero-sequel-leans-into-horror-delivers-adventure-laughs-despite-issues-20231221/) (B-):

>The good thing is that it’s not trying to be anything different, and the focus is on thrills rather than taking itself too seriously, even when it dips its toes into the pool of deep and meaningful.

[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/12/21/aquaman-2-review-kingdom-movie/71957316007/) (2.5/4):

>The movie doesn’t sink nor swim: It’s aggressively fine, floating along as a breezy-enough outing – and a brotherly one, at that – without any particularly spectacular strokes.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1475671/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-review/) (7/10):

>When the plot gets going and we're on a road trip through fantastical locations, the movie becomes a fun ride. It's not as good as the original, but it is still one of the better superhero films of the year.

[Collider](https://collider.com/aquaman-2-review/) (2.5/5):

>Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom isn’t the wet fart of an ending that it seemed like the DCEU might be going out on, but it also shows that a decade in, the DCEU never quite learned the lessons it needed to. The DCEU is dead, long live the DCU.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-review-1234937194/) (C-):

>“The Lost Kingdom” becomes more and more formulaic as it digs into its mythos, as if the movie were caught between being its own thing and being nothing at all.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-review-jason-momoa-dceu) (6/10):

>Say what you will about what this now-concluded chapter in DC cinematic history deserves... Arthur Curry going out on his own terms with a complete disinterest in wHaT iT aLl MeAnS fOr ThE fRaNcHiSe is both incredibly on-brand and objectively funny.

[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-movie-review/) (2.5/5):

>Aquaman & The Lost Kingdom is as goofy and adventurous as the first movie, but tries too hard for a seriousness it can never achieve with Jason Momoa.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-review/) (2/5):

>Aqua #2 has to be considered a disappointment – one that, in endeavouring to emulate what made Wan’s original the highest-grossing DC film of all time, merely serves up more of the same to increasingly bathetic effect.

[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20231221-aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-review-never-attempts-anything-original-or-honest) (2/5):

>The trouble is that Momoa's selling point as an actor is how natural and physical he is, whereas nothing in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom seems real.

[The Daily Beast] (https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/aquaman-2-review-actually-the-worst-dc-movie-yet) (Skip This):

>A franchise farewell so underwhelming, nary a tear will be shed over its passing.

[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/aquaman-2-review-amber-heard-b2466741.html) (1/5):

>Yet another reminder that cinema is locked in a corporate chokehold, robbing artists of the ability even to flail about in style anymore.

[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-review/) (1/5):

>It felt like entire clumps of grey matter were giving up the gig in disgust and abseiling out of my ears.

[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/dec/21/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-review-jason-momoa-terrible-sequel-pollutes-the-dcu-ocean) (1/5):

>At the end of 124 long minutes, both film and audience are deeply immersed in something – but it isn’t seawater.

**Synopsis**

Having failed to defeat Aquaman the first time, Black Manta, still driven by the need to avenge his father’s death, will stop at nothing to take Aquaman down once and for all. This time Black Manta is more formidable than ever before, wielding the power of the mythic Black Trident, which unleashes an ancient and malevolent force. To defeat him, Aquaman will turn to his imprisoned brother Orm, the former King of Atlantis, to forge an unlikely alliance. Together, they must set aside their differences in order to protect their kingdom and save Aquaman’s family, and the world, from irreversible destruction.
