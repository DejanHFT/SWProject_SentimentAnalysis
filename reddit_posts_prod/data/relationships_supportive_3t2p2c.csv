[HAPPY UPDATE!] My (24F) ‘friend’ (28f) is accusing me of supporting the Paris bombing and of being an IS supporter because I couldn’t pitch in for donations to a Paris school.,throwexplosions,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3t2p2c/happy_update_my_24f_friend_28f_is_accusing_me_of/,102,801,"EDIT: Thank you all for your comments <3 I think the legal advice I got here (suing, retraining order etc) is a bit American-centric, as I don't think suing or getting restraining order in my particular case would even be possible in the country I am in. They have different laws. I might file a report with the police, in a 'fyi this happened and you should know about it' way. I will crosspost to the legal advice sub later in the day, and ask for a Europe-centric view (if possible) on the matter. I am not very comfortable in giving my exact country, to be honest. I want to protect myself and others, but I do not want lawsuits and stuff like those. <3

Hi guys! I want to thank each and everyone of you for your advice and comments! You were all very very helpful, and some of your comments might have saved my ass!

**The update**

The morning after my reddit post (Sunday), I spent time screenshotting and archiving my all FB posts (going back to mid-2014) related to my stance against ISIS. That was a laborious task but I am so glad I did it. I also screenshotted/archived all of X(the b*tch)’s posts related to me (that I could see). I also archived and screenshotted my usual non-ISIS posts (mainly photos of my dog and funny memes ha)


On Sunday afternoon, I received an email from friend Y (the great friend!) addressed to our department head, programme coordinator, my 2 thesis supervisors, me, some friends and the bitch (in CC), with various screenshots of the bitch’s rants about me. These included FB group posts (invisible to me), FB inbox messages, SMSs, whatsapp messages, statutes of hers on FB (invisible and visible to me) and even some tweets (I didn’t know she was on twitter, so I wasn’t aware of that). All of those exchanges were dated from late Friday to an hour before the email. There was text in the email about how this was an important and urgent matter that she (Y) wanted to draw the attention of the administration to because of the nature of the matter. 


The gist of what the screenshots had in them:
* I am an ISIS supporter and was glad about the France bombings,
* A rant about how I am a much better student than hers ‘even though I am Lebanese’
* A threat about her (The Bitch) going to the administration AND the police (on Monday!!!) to tell them about my ‘illegal activities’ (my guess, like some of you said: that I was gonna issue a bomb threat)
* How I was a liar and a thief (wat)
* How I was a radical Muslim (I'm not even muslim -.-)
* And other incoherent nonsensical ranting

I was laughing (hysterically) because I was in disbelief but I was really really anxious and worried. I called Y and thanked her a lot for this (that’s what probably saved my ass) and asked her if she would come tomorrow to see the admin. I also sent a text message thanking my other friends (who were included in the mail). 


The next day (today), I printed out all the screenshots I had and got a call from one of my thesis supervisors that I need to come to an urgent meeting. I called Y and she was already on campus so we went to my supervisor’s office. The Bitch was already there. The Bitch had the audacity to call me and Y a liar and insinuated that ALL the screenshots in the email were faked. The supervisor clearly did not believe her, at all. I showed my sup all the printed screenshots (Related to ISIS and some of the other random posts I made) and also showed her my baptism certificate, too! At that point it was clear who was telling her truth.


Then The Bitch actually showed my supervisor how I ‘made’ a post about ‘I hope France is bombed into oblivion’. ISIS was removed in Paint and it was so so evident that it was faked. I showed my sup the original post I had made and I was so relieved I had it with me. 


I really wanted to know WHY X was doing what she was doing. So I asked her. Many times. She wouldn’t say so then my supervisor actually threatened her with legal action because she disturbed the work environment. Then the bitch calmly said that she was jealous of me and how I got masters funding before her (even though she had been there 2 years before me). I seriously had a hard time believe that jealousy almost pushed her to call the cops and fabricate lies about me.


My supervisor then asked me what I wanted to do next. I told her that 1) I don’t have time to sue X and 2) I was pretty sure X needed mental help, not a lawsuit.

After the meeting officially ended (when X left to go see our programme coordinator, at the demand of my supervisor), two friends told my sup and myself that X has a history of extreme jealousy and destructive behaviour but that she has been ok for 3 years now (so she was ok when I first met her). Them knowing about her past pushed them to send the email with evidence of how she was behaving. I am not sure why this topic didn’t come up previously but I guess it’s not something that is talked about easily I suppose. And I think the email was a brilliant idea. I will definitely cut ALL ties with X but I just don’t think suing is the way to go about it? She clearly is unstable and unbalanced. She almost fucked my life though so I am torn. I just want to graduate and start the next chapter of my life, where I will most likely never see X ever again.


I am so relieved reddit, I think this is the best outcome, given the circumstances, thank you all so much and so sorry for the novel <3


TL;DR: my ‘friend’ turned out to be mentally ill, with a past of lying and destructive behaviour. No one bought her masquerade. I will probably not sue.
