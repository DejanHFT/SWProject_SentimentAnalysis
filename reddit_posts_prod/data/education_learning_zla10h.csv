Observation system to promote personalized learning,metafictitious,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/zla10h/observation_system_to_promote_personalized/,7,2,"Hello all - I am working on a system that allows teachers to capture student development in a classroom over time as a "" chronology"" of events. 

My initial hypothesis has been that - The feedback by a teacher is very effective for a student if an observation is adequately captured in a classroom setting. This was validated by a few teachers when I started building this. Now I am at a stage where I need to get more feedback from educators on a system that is fully functional. 

Since I am not a salesperson with extensive contacts in the education system - I am falling short of options to find folks who could give me ""unfiltered"" feedback on what works and what doesn't. 

Any feedback from this community on what I could do, to gather feedback from educators would be very helpful?

PS: My application available on app stores and web but it is hard to get users who can give me a direct feedback :("
