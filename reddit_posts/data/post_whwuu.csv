Has there been much thought given to how an economy will function when the vast majority of the work is performed by robots/AI?,Scaryclouds,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/whwuu/has_there_been_much_thought_given_to_how_an/,24,17,"Over the next twenty or so years drone technology will put every person who drives/pilots for a living, truck drivers, taxi drivers, airplane pilots, etc. out of a job.

Personal robot technology will put people who clean homes/buildings, help the elderly/disabled, and a lot of other tasks also out of a job or severely limit the number of positions available.

AI technology in general will continue to decrease labor requirements by making workers more productive or outright replacing them (call centers). Even doctors are not immune as technology is being developed that is better at diagnosing diseases than they are (melanoma for example).

Anyways now that I briefly covered what any expert in the field would already know about, I am curious, how will an economy work when robots/AI are doing all the work? Will this be a near utopian society where there is very little want because the abundance of resources? A dystopian one where there is a huge amount of poverty as only a few can work and a few who own the means of production? Or something in between? "
