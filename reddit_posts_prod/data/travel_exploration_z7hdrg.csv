Suggestion needed to explore Singapore for 3 days,amalsk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/z7hdrg/suggestion_needed_to_explore_singapore_for_3_days/,26,10," Hey all! I really need your suggestion in planning my itinerary to Singapore in December.

I would be arriving with my friends on the morning of 11th December. I heard it was rainy during this time. I would be there until the 15th of December as my flight is on the 16th December morning.

Out of these days, we have December 11th(the day we arrive), December 14th and December 15th(until evening) to explore in and around Singapore.

What is the best way to go about Singapore, is it the MRT and Public Transport?

Also, is it necessary that we take a local sim once we reach there or could we survive with just public and free WiFis?

Since we arrive at around 9AM on the 11th, what would you suggest that we do for the rest of the whole day?

Also, we have 14th whole day for us and 15th until the evening where my friends would have to leave to the airport by 7 since their flight is at 10pm. So we have until the evening of 15th, what do you suggest we do for those two days as well?

We had initially planned to visit Universal Studios Singapore on the last day, i.e. 15th but can we enjoy it in such a short duration or do we need a whole day dedicated to it?

Here are the places we shortlisted to visit:

1. Universal Studios, SG

2. Art Science Museum

3. Gardens by the bay, Cloud forest

4. Merlion

5. Supertree groves and the light show

6. Skypark observation(flyer)

7. Marina bay sands observation from the top

So far these are what we could manage to come up with. Do you guys have any suggestions on more places and how we can go about in this short period?

Thank you \^\_\^"
