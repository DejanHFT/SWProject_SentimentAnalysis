The most overused line in cinema,Dragava,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/13asjec/the_most_overused_line_in_cinema/,136,20,"“*There’s two kinds of people in the world: ***blank*** and ***blank***. (Which one are you gonna be?)*”

I couldn’t even list all the films I’ve seen it crop up in. Cocktail, Scent of a Woman, Sweeney Todd, Transformers 3, Focus, The Fisher King, When Harry Met Sally, The Italian Job, American Sniper, 500 Days of Summer. That’s barely scratching the surface.  

I’m honestly amazed at how much I’ll come across it. I’ll flick on the most random movie and sure enough, there it is like a bad penny. Even in masterworks like Lawrence of Arabia and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly characters say it. Why is it so attractive to writers?!

I don’t know what annoys me so much about it - it’s almost like the writer’s pausing the movie for a second because they just *have* to tell you about the life-altering epiphany they’ve just had on how the world works. 

The only times I feel it’s passable is when it’s played only for laughs or we know the character is already a jerk, like in Mean Girls or The Breakfast Club. ***”There’s fat people that were born to be fat and there’s fat people that were once thin but became fat.”***

So anyway there’s my rant. Just something I’ve noticed for years and hadn’t been bothered to highlight till now. Am I overreacting? Probably. 

Do you guys have any examples of when you thought this actually worked? Or any other screenwriting cliches you see characters spouting in every second movie you see?"
