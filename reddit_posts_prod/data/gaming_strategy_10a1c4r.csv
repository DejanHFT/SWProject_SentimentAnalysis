Trying to get into those strategy esque kingdom building games,Praisethedarkmoon,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10a1c4r/trying_to_get_into_those_strategy_esque_kingdom/,13,1,"The series I’m talking about are Mount and Blade, Tropico, Crusader kings, Total war, and Civilisation.

I understand some of those series aren’t even the same genre but I literally have no fucking clue they all look the same to me, the only game I’ve played like that is Plague Inc and those shitty mobile games like Simpsons tapped out.

I have no idea where to start with these games, the differences between them and what each one offers.

Could any fans of those games help a homie out and explain them to me and which ones I should play?

Piqued my interested when I saw the game of thrones mods for some of those games but I’d like to play them vanilla first."
