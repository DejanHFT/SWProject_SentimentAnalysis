Teacher looking for astronomy resources!,CrazyNarwhal4,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/d5q68f/teacher_looking_for_astronomy_resources/,12,15,"Mods, please delete if not allowed.

I am teaching astronomy for the first time this year, and I want my students to have a simple, practical star map that they can use when looking at the constellations. 

Apps are great, so I would love to hear about good ones, but some of my students do not have a phone (plus sometimes the phone light can be distracting!) so printable resources would be welcome as well.

What do you like?

Thanks!"
