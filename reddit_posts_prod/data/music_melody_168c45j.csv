Songs where verses don't share same melody,AdriannaLisa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/168c45j/songs_where_verses_dont_share_same_melody/,2,2,"I was listening to Sugababes ""Round Round"", a childhood favourite of mine and realised that the verses have a quite different melody, which together with the bridge means that while the song's structure was fairly traditional, each singer had a different melody to sing solo on and chorus was the only piece of composition that was repeated. From the top of my head can't think of many other songs like this, at least not in mainstream music, what would they be?
