How much do you rely on inspiration(when outlining at least),appman1138,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/vctwhy/how_much_do_you_rely_on_inspirationwhen_outlining/,7,2,"I ask this because I've been reminded several times about the 1% inspiration 99% perspiration rule a million times.

For one, I'm writing an outline for a screenplay. I wouldn't have started it if it weren't for the bright feeling of inspiration that made me think of the premise.

Plus we wouldn't be writers if it weren't for inspiration. If inspiration played no role, then we might as well be grocery baggers instead. There is a reason we want to express ourselves, and inspiration separates us from people who don't care.

Now I admit the ideas that aren't spurred by inspiration are important too. It doesnt change that the 1% is vitally important to fuel the 99%. 

So I have several bullet points in my outline. Before I add more, part of me thinks I need more of the 1%, because I'm in a mini slump.

Let's make sense of this rule once and for all, give me your thoughts."
