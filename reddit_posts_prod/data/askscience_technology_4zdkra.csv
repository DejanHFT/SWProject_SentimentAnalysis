AskScience AMA Series: We have discovered an Earth-mass exoplanet around the nearest star to our Solar System. AMA!,AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4zdkra/askscience_ama_series_we_have_discovered_an/,1041,9578,"*Guests:* Pale Red Dot team, Julien Morin (Laboratoire Univers et Particules de Montpellier, Universite de Montpellier, CNRS, France), James Jenkins (Departamento de Astronomia, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile), Yiannis Tsapras (Zentrum fur Astronomie der Universitat Heidelberg (ZAH), Heidelberg, Germany).

*Summary:* We are a team of astronomers running a campaign called the Pale Red Dot. We have found definitive evidence of a planet in orbit around the closest star to Earth, besides the Sun. The star is called Proxima Centauri and lies just over 4 light-years from us. The planet we've discovered is now called Proxima b and this makes it the closest exoplanet to us and therefore the main target should we ever develop the necessary technologies to travel to a planet outside the Solar System. 

Our results have just been published today in Nature, but our observing campaign lasted from mid January to April 2016. We have kept a blog about the entire process here: [www.palereddot.org](http://www.palereddot.org/) and have also communicated via Twitter @Pale_Red_Dot and Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/](https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/)

We will be available starting 22:00 CEST (16 ET, 20 UT). Ask Us Anything!
