My story might have taken too much inspiration,Early-Mistake-4213,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/15kqe7j/my_story_might_have_taken_too_much_inspiration/,6,4,"Lately, I've been planning a story that was inspired by a game I'm hyperfixated on currently. Midway through planning, I realized that I may have taken too many ideas from it. 

So far, my story is about the mc who is introduced to his best friend's other friends and she soon (self unalives). The girl's favourite friend out of the group she introduced does not care about her but instead uses the opportunity to manipulate the mc into falling in love with her while the other two girls start going haywire. 

If you haven't guessed already, my inspiration has come from the game Doki Doki Literature Club. I've tried changing character names, appearance, personality and deaths, but I'm worried people would accuse me of plagiarism or something. Any advice?"
