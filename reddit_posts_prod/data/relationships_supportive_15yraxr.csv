How to be supportive when I (M33) don’t agree with my partners (F33)?,popsilolicle,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15yraxr/how_to_be_supportive_when_i_m33_dont_agree_with/,1,1,"Hi there rs community, I would like to get some advice about how to handle my (M33) current situation with my partner. 

My partner (F33) started a new full time job working with a relatively young company. Right off the bat I felt that things were a bit weird when the company employed her under a full time position and agreed to pay her a very comfortable salary (it would put her in the top 20-30% earners in our age group in our country) for what seemed to be a relatively small scope of work. 

She had been working as a relief lecturer and the arrangement agreed upon when she was hired, was that she can continue to teach a single class till the module expired. The company has two bosses, husband and wife couple, the husband who hired her was nice and said she could continue to teach so long as it didn’t affect her work/working hours but he did expect her to drop lecturing once the module was done. 

However my gf continued to take on new classes and did not relinquish any of her existing classes, she told me that she didn’t want to risk losing the teaching opportunities if she was out of the scene for too long. Due to this, she has very inconsistent hours with the new company, every week at least 2 to 3 days she will only be at the office for a few hours. She always goes in at 1030am and leaves at latest 430pm on the days she doesn’t have classes, and on the days she does have classes, she’ll go in at the same time and leave at 130pm. She’s able to do this because the bosses don’t come in very often and because she has a friend in the office (her friend introduced her to the company) who helps her try to get away with sneaking out as well. 

Everyone else in the company has strict working hours of 9am to 6pm, my partner is the only one who has not been adhering to the hours and her justification is she has classes and that when she was hired, the male boss told her she could continue to teach her class. Obviously this has caused her to not be very popular in the office with many unhappy with her arrangement.

I’ve tried to be as supportive to my partner throughout this journey but truthfully has been frustrating and even annoying to deal with my partner because she’s always stressed out and tired from juggling her schedule. We are not poor, we are not struggling. I’ve asked her why she is doing this, and she says she just doesn’t want to give a good opportunity. Fair enough, but something about the whole thing feels wrong to me. 

She constantly tells me that she needs me to be more supportive of her, especially emotionally. Which to her, means being on her side of things, for example when she’s complaining about her coworkers not being nice to her. Unfortunately a lot of the time, especially when it’s about her work situation, I don’t agree with what she is doing or how she’s going about it. I try not to judge and just listen without saying anything because I realized she would just take my differing opinions or suggestions as not being supportive of her. 

Honestly I’m just really frustrated because I don’t want to be this in supportive partner but it’s very uncomfortable for me to be advocating for behaviors I don’t agree with. Any advice for me in this community? Thank you.

Tl;dr partner has work behaviors I don’t agree with, gets upset when I am not supportive. Should I grit my teeth and “pretend” to go along with it or should I continue to tell her honestly how I feel despite that the opposes her behaviors."
