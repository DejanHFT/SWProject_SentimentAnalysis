What's your strangest/most unusual recipe that's still delicious?,dappitydap,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/66al57/whats_your_strangestmost_unusual_recipe_thats/,133,153,"I was recently looking for a recipe for what to do with some leftover strawberries and I came across [this intriguing but slightly alarming](http://nymag.com/restaurants/recipes/inseason/33122/) recipe for strawberry spaghetti.

This put me on a kick to try and find weird but delicious recipes with surprising ingredients. What I found was either too weird (so many savory jello recipes) or not weird at all (prosciutto and melon somehow ended up on at least half of the lists).

I'm looking for any and all strange recipes, whether they are intricate or simple, have exotic or common ingredients, or are completely new or a common recipe with a weird twist."
