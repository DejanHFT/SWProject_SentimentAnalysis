"TIL A will-o'-the-wisp, or ignis fatuus, is a ghostly light seen by travellers at night. It resembles a flickering lamp and is said to recede if approached, drawing travellers from the safe paths. The phenomenon is known by names, including jack-o'-lantern, hinkypunk, and hobby lantern in English.",Mrsphan1999,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignis_fatuus,11,53,No text content
