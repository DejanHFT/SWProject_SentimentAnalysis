Timeline: [https://ibb.co/3ys05Wc](https://ibb.co/3ys05Wc)

I love to read all these futuristic news but at the end of the day it all ends up in a fuzzy feeling of ""the future is here"" and nothing else. That's why I love to open my Excel Timeline and edit the milestones while I am reading all these fantastic news. It really helps me to ground my imagination but still be superexcited about the future each time I wake up every morning. If you are a daily reader like me, I encourage you to give this concept a try (find mine in Excel format: [https://wetransfer.com/downloads/e99d824e49f02b5d892108cfcd88f46920210419131903/957351](https://wetransfer.com/downloads/e99d824e49f02b5d892108cfcd88f46920210419131903/957351)).

Please, consider that this is just a mix of readings, Elon Musk optimism and my personal predictions. You are more than welcome to correct me in everything or to point me out to new sources. I can only debate regarding space and life extension which are the ones that I research extensively."
