An Attempt at a Classification,killerdinoblood,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/95lmux/an_attempt_at_a_classification/,5,5,"Greetings,

What you will witness here is my attempt at categorizing the different thinkers and worldviews into artificially made ""categories"" that attempt to demonstrate the similarities and differences between these systems.

A book I've been reading recently inspired me to make this chart. The book is called ""Weltschmerz"" by Frederick Beiser and it explores the german pessimism controversy and the questions about the value of life. The fundamental basis for that question, many thinkers maintained, was not to be found in the cold calculus of Reason, but had to take feeling (or, the ""Passions"" if you prefer) into account. Which gave me the idea to classify the various philosophers depending on their philosophical positions.

At first I made a circular pie-like graph that tried to categorize them, but it ended up in disaster. Then, I simply tried to group the philosophers between the 4 categories I came up with, but it didn't work so well either (it was weird to place Stoicism on equal footing with Platonism, when one is pantheistic and the other immanently immaterialist). I thought that my little project wasn't going anywhere, until I saw a random image of the political compass on google. I had totally forgotten about it, but it was just the kind of thing I needed. I positioned the 4 categories on different ends of the spectrums and began to classify. As you will see, it too is not perfect but it was the best attempt I made so far and I decided to share it with you guys.

It is important not to confuse this with the ""Empiricism/Rationalism"" debate. This debate is inessential since Kant and it was dominated by (what my chart refers to as) ""Reason"" since the very beginning. Infact, in my opinion, most of the empiricism/rationalism debate can be divided in this chart, by placing the ""Rationalists"" at the extreme end of ""Reason"", while the empiricists generally are in the more central, ""moderate"" camp of reason, with Hume ascending quite beyond the typical position (there are also other exceptions).

What the ""Passion/Feeling"" vs ""Reason"" categories attempt to reflect is the age old conflict between the ""Heart"" and the ""Head"" and to which do we lean to. However, it must be stated that almost none of the philosohpers and/or schools that I have placed in ""Passion"" have explicitly preferred the ""Passions"" over ""Reason"". All of them have recognized reason as important. The reason they are in the ""Passion"" camp is because that is where they lean to relative to the positions of the ""Reason""-heavy philosophers. I.e. the relations between the philosophies determine their position. Seen in an isolated manner, a single philosophy can express all 4 categories. In order to place it somewhere, it has to be compared to other philosophies. Additionally, the other schema that helped me with the classification is: How much of an importance did this philosophy place on the passions? Are they essential to the individual? Are they redundant? Are they viewed as an obstacle to be overcome and etc.

Materialism - This category is increasingly harder to define in our modern age, with quantuum physics shattering the barrier between the perceptible and the imperceptible. What was called materialism back in the day of the Enlightenment (and before it) and what we call it now is more or less different. Thus, in a vain attempt to remain consistent, I shall define Materialism as the doctrine that places more importance on the physical reality and it's properties, and the insistence that what is important to society, can be determined by physical clues and achieved through physical means.

Idealism & Spiritualism - This is where things get a little confusing. I assume that many of you will wonder why I regard Idealism and Spiritualism as the same category. I admit, they are not completely identical, but I find that there are more similarities between them than differences, and that, if separated, without Idealism, Spiritualism would not be important enough to merit a category of it's own (and even if it did, it would further confuse the chart and it's placements). In addition, I am of the opinion that any kind of occult/esoteric teaching heavily presupposes Idealism and frequently makes use of ""idealist"" arguments. This is why I regard them both as intimately connected. Now, of to some definitions:

Idealism - The belief that reality as we perceive it is shaped and permeated by what is mental and that our psychological efforts (or the efforts of metaphysical beings) can bring substantial changes to this reality.

Spiritualism - Unquestionable belief in a ""transcendent"" realm and a relegation of great importance to ritual and magic of any kind.

The presupposition that some kind of immaterial substance influences our being, existence and perception.

I assume parralels could be drawn between my distinctions and the MBTI theory. Of special importance are the xSFx, xSTx, xNFx and xNTx types. Nevertheless, I rarely used MBTI to help in my classification (instead, preferring to focus on the philosophy instead of the person, but still trying to consider both)

It will be noticed that, while most placements are of specific philosophers, there are ""general"" placements like Hinduism, Christianity, Islam and etc. An army of thinkers, each deserving his own placement, stand behind these summarized schools, and indeed subsuming all of them into one general ""ism"" is not entirely fair. However, for the time being, this will have to do.

Now off to some specific explanation of the placements

The Romanticists notoriously placed great importance on ""feeling"" and Herder & Hamann were quite critical of the cold rationalism of the enlightenment. I'd consider placing them closer to Materialism, due to their emphasis on Nature (i.e. the natural) but they, along with the American Transcendentalists and Dark/Gothic Romantics were primarily preoccupied with the ""mystical"" and the inexpressible. Their reverence to nature is only an aftereffect of their astonishment with what is unexplainable.

Thelema - The Thelemites are just as ritualistic as their other occult peers. However, they are unique in that they place a greater emphasis on ""sex magick"" but not for material purposes (as do the Cyrenaics) but as a way to cultivate their greater selves.

Empedocles & Schopenhauer - My understanding of Empedocles is largely Schopenhauerian, in that the Love/Strife duo is an aspect of the will. Both regarded animals with great compassion and Schopenhauer specifically was clear that the Intellect is a servant of the Will. However, the close proximity to ""Reason"" indicates that, after all, with Schopenhauer salvation largely depends on the Intellect's rebellion over the Will. Yet, Arthur is ultimately in the ""Passion"" category for he explicitly criticizes the Stoics for ""hardening their hearts"" and thus being unable to grasp the true suffering of the world.

Jainism - Admittedly, this is a weird placement. Jainism is an atheistic philosophy and their close proximity to Idealism/Spiritualism might appear odd. They are epistemological pluralists, which (for me) places them more towards the centre. But ultimately, I've relegated them in the ""Passion"" camp due to the fact that many would find the Jain aversion to killing microorganisms/nigoda as straight up unreasonable and their overall emphasis on asceticism (and belief in achieving a transcendent state of/in Moksha) means that they fall within the Idealist/Spiritualism realm.

(it is interesting that, if this placement is correct, Schopenhauer is closer to Jainism than he is to Buddhism, which is a shame as he regarded them as the same)

Jung - Jung, along with Freud's recognition of the unconscious impulses in determining human behaviour places them in between ""Passion"" and ""Reason"" (due to their insistence on them doing ""scientific research""). Yet Jung focused his attention more on the ""mystical"" aspect of the human psyche and the means towards it's realization (contrast this with Freud's emphasis on sexuality).

Hinduism, Buddhism, Stoicism, Judaism, Zoroastrianism - I had great problems in placing these because they all blend the ""physical"" and the ""metaphysical"" in their own unique ways. Hinduism is some kind of panentheism (at least the Advaita Vedanta school) with it's claim that our world and Brahman are essentially one. Stoicism, similarly, espouse a pantheist philosophy, despite believing in a ""soul"". Judaism recognizes that God will bring Heaven on Earth after judgement day, which is once again a weird mix-up between the material and the spiritual (in all of the Abrahamic religions, the soul and body are intimately connected). Buddhist is also vague with it's terms. Is Nirvana a psychological state achieved in this life or is it a transcendent realm that has to be attained but that cannot be spoken of? In Zoroastrianism, the battle between Ahura Mazda and Ahriman is happening not only on the spiritual plain, but in this life aswell. Nevertheless, I decided that all of these schools lean slightly towards ""Idealism/Spiritualism"" due to their doctrines of ""materialism + something else"".

Mystical Christianity, Kierkegaard and Islam - This is the category of orthodox hesychasm, franciscans, fideists, sufi, dervish, voluntarists and others that place the ""feeling of being with God"" as central (contrast this with Christian Scholasticism's intellectualism and emphasis on ""contemplation of God"". Interestingly, Meister Eckhart is a curious example of an ""intellectualist mystic"". For Islam's version of scholasticism and intellectualism, Averroes may be cited).

Buddhism is closer to ""Passion"" than Stoicism (due to Buddhist emphasis on compassion) but in the end, I still find them to be a very cold and rational philosophy. A testament to this is Buddhism's aversion towards art and it being espoused by a number of modern day scientists (contrast this with Schopenhauer's melancholism and pessimism and him being espoused by a large number of artists.)

Aristotle - His philosophy of the ""golden mean"" makes an honest attempt at walking a ""middle path"" towards virtue, yet when compared to other philosophies, Aristotle comes across as  rationalistic and a bit materialistic (although, of course, not entirely).

Duhring - I assume that not a lot of people know about Eugen Duhring. I added him to the list because he is a rare example of a positivist that places a greater emphasis on feeling. Because of his valuable position, I wanted to demonstrate it on the chart

Leibniz & Fichte - Leibniz is one of the first, if not the first philosopher that pondered over the ""unconscious"", which means that he was receptive toward the influence of ""feeling"" on our behaviour. As for Fichte, his emphasis on emotive action which leads to the self-consciousness of the ""I"" means that he also recognizes the importance of ""feeling"" in human behaviour.

This is a rather short explanation for the placements, with many philosophies being omitted an explanation. I will give more in-depth answers if specific questions arise for specific thinkers. And make no mistake, I am by no means an expert on all of these (ahem... any of these) thinkers. These are all just my opinions and they are entirely falsifiable, so do take this with a grain of salt and a healthy dose of criticism.

Open to all forms of feedback and thank you for your time!

Edit #2: Some updates on the placements (with Berkeley posing a great problem for me, as I am never entirely sure where to place him)

Edit: And here is a visual representation to make perception easier:
