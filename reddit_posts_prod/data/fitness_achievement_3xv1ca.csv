Any advice to achieve the splits?,happygetaway,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3xv1ca/any_advice_to_achieve_the_splits/,7,1,"I'm a 25 y/o, 195lbs male looking to do the splits, why you ask? Well I've always wanted to do the splits, idk why but just a goal I've wanted to achieve; Also, I play a sport(rugby) and in a position where I need flexibility in my legs and hips, cutting, sprinting and tackling.

I work on my flexiblity a lot already, I take a good 10-15 mins of stretching before and after practices/workouts. I'm currently able to get maybe 50% of the way down horizontally(legs side to side). 

I don't know if this is the correct sub, if you could point me the right way I would greatly appreciate it!"
