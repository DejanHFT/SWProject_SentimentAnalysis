Finding the line between taking inspiration and copying,dyorknine,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/xlacff/finding_the_line_between_taking_inspiration_and/,2,1,I'm currently trying to write a story that I thought of as a mix between a dream and a not-very detailed point in a video game. I'm afraid of going too far to be copying the game instead of just taking inspiration? Where is the line between the two?
