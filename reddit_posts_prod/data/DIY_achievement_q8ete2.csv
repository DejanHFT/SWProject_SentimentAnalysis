Curbless Cement Shower Floor,shopahmor,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/q8ete2/curbless_cement_shower_floor/,43,207,"We are renovating our oversized garage into a guesthouse, which includes adding a bathroom. We are considering polishing the concrete slab, and using that as our flooring throughout. I would love to continue this look into the bathroom, and create a curbless cement shower look. 

I understand a shower relies on a waterproofing system to work efficiently. Would it be sufficient to build a curbless shower pan with mud/mortar mix, apply a liquid waterproofing membrane, then pour concrete over to finish the look? I am anticipating sealing the concrete as well.   


Or what would the best method to achieving a shower like this? I have seen concrete floors in multiple shower inspirations, but nowhere does it list the best way to do it. I appreciate any help or insight.
