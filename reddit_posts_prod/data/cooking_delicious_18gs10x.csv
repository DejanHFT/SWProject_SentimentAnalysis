I ate a sandwich that looked a lot like a Philly cheesesteak. The guy who cooked it was middle eastern and didn’t speak perfect English..it sounded like he called it “sober steak”. Anyone know what this is?,Morrisinthemiddle2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/18gs10x/i_ate_a_sandwich_that_looked_a_lot_like_a_philly/,176,586,Edit::: it was “super steak”. I had it again last night. Delicious.
