New found taste for turn based Strategy. Where to go next?,lvet000,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10ggn74/new_found_taste_for_turn_based_strategy_where_to/,47,1,"I know it's kind of a strange place to start but in 2022 I discovered Mario Rabbids (!), and I absolutely devoured the game, all it's DLCs and extra stages.

Following some advice I have tried and absolutely adored:

- Mario Rabbids Sparks of Hope (is there a DLC already?)
- Fire Emblem 3 Houses
- XCOM (1) and it's DLC, heard there is a fan made expansion called the Long War, is it worth replaying?
- Into the breach

I also tried XCOM 2 but I didn't like that one, felt a bit overwhelming. There is just to much stuff to focus on (yeah, this about the level of complexity where I have to draw the line :) )

I have acess to a NSwitch, an Xbox series S and a potato Laptop (Ran the first Xcom well enough).

Any recommendations? Thanks in advance.

Edit: r/gamingsuggestions was the correct place for this as some have pointed out. I'm sorry, didn't think of looking."
