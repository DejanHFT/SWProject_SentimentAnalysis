"Does anyone regret writing stories inspired by sadness, heartaches or trauma?",kodi_kai,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/16tmsme/does_anyone_regret_writing_stories_inspired_by/,61,91,"I was watching a video of an artist on stage once, who seemed deeply disturbed that he had to keep singing this song he had written, about a sad moment in his life. The crowd was cheering and he told them to hush, as if he seemed to hate that they were celebrating this moment that he had to keep reliving.

Do you ever have a similar experience or regret when writing (especially fiction) stories which have their roots in some deep heartache? The way it will remind you again and again?

I know life is often our biggest muse, but wonder sometimes if any of us regret blurring the line too much."
