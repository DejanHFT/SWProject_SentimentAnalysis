"Girlfriend's grandfather passed, and with him, a lot of family history. Found a Japanese sword her great-grandfather got in WW2, but do not know any of its history.",DorkusMalorkuss,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2vws7n/girlfriends_grandfather_passed_and_with_him_a_lot/,89,543,"As mentioned, not exactly sure of any of this sword's history other than the fact that great grandfather received it while he was in Japan. He was a POW from May 1942 to August 1945. Hoping someone might have any insight on region, type, or what the swords purpose may have been (officer, display, etc).

Edit: thank you all so much for the information! I'll try to cross-post this to /r/swords when I get home - on phone now. Really appreciate all of the info. Wonder how he got his hands on this if it's from Burma and he was on Japan as a POW."
