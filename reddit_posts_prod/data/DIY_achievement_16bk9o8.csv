Anchor Torque,Randyd718,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/16bk9o8/anchor_torque/,1,1,"I have some Hilti HLC-HX 5/16x2-5/8 anchors that say I should tighten them to 5 ft-lb and over-tightening will reduce their strength. I would theoretically use a torque wrench for this, but they all seem to bottom out around 10 to 20 ft-lbs. Is there a good way I can achieve or at least approximate this? My neighbor let me borrow a very old ""analog"" torque wrench but wondering if there is a better alternative.  


FYI my project is mounting a TV on 5/8"" drywall over 3/4"" fur strip over concrete. The TV is relatively light (35-ish lbs) but I usually watch with the arm extended forward all the way out, so I wanted to get into the concrete. "
