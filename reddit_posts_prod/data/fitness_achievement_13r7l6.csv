"Am I vain? I'm hesitant to believe any Hollywood workout plan, but what did Tom Hardy do to achieve this look? I want it so bad.",quackkhead,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/13r7l6/am_i_vain_im_hesitant_to_believe_any_hollywood/,118,119,"You always see a workout plan submitted by a [website](http://www.cagepotato.com/check-out-tom-hardys-warrior-workout/) or [magazine](http://www.menshealth.co.uk/building-muscle/fast/tom-hardys-warrior-workout) following a big movie like *Thor* with Chris Hemsworth or *Dark Knight Rises* with Christian Bale but I'm reluctant to take any of them seriously. My limited knowledge of fitness tells me that these publications can't be trusted.

I've never seen *Warrior* but I just came across this picture of [Tom Hardy](http://i.imgur.com/fHmzw.jpg). I would like to, as Mr. Hardy has, become one with the sexy swole. I'm on that path already, having already lifted SS for 6 months, and recently moved over to a 5-day split. At 5'10"" I went from 160 lbs in January to 201 lbs currently. I've got satisfactory strength and good mass, but sculpting is becoming difficult. It's winter, so I keep eating and lifting. But I'm afraid when I cut I'll be big in all the wrong places. How can I be sure I'm doing it right?

TL;DR - I got a man-crush"
