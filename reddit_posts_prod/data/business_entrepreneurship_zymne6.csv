"I'm a teenager, and want to earn money.",Party-Eggplant5524,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/zymne6/im_a_teenager_and_want_to_earn_money/,145,54,"Hi, I'm 16 and want to earn money. Is there anything outside of fast food or typical retail that can earn me money? I'm really interested in businesses and entrepreneurship as a path in life, but for now, SOMETHING needs to exist!!! Does anyone know what I can do?  


I am also into art, so Adobe Illustrator is something I know. Hell me and my brother have made money from a roblox game, but something more worth my time is in my interest. I will do anything."
