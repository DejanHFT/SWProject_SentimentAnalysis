"Me [22 F] with my mom, she is demanding I buy all the adults in my extended family a nice gift as a ""thank you for being supportive and now I got my first big girl job"" kind of thing. For several reasons, I think her demands are ridiculous. Are they? Or am I being too tight on the purse strings?",amibeingscrooge,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3slsb7/me_22_f_with_my_mom_she_is_demanding_i_buy_all/,300,836,"So background, and oh my god this is so specific I hope nobody guesses my real identity but it's relevant. I started modeling at age 13. I did a mix of everything from high fashion things like Vogue to commercial Macy's ads. I haven't spent a dime of what I made except for ""personal investments"" like academic training camp. I was lucky my parents didn't make me pay for my own college tuition/living expenses until I got my first job (no kid in my family does/did.) Although I did buy things like textbooks but small in the grand scheme of things.

Anyway, my modeling jobs and insane saving/investing discipline let me save a great nest's egg that I now have put in emergency funds/retirement accounts/investments. It's in between 50k and 80k range. I don't plan to spend it even now, it's my investment into my future, perhaps buying property or when I'm 30 and wanting to start a family. Who knows.

I didn't make as much money as I probably could have if I took full advantage of a modeling career because I took school *very* seriously. I don't mean to sound like I'm tootin' my horn, but I was easily the most studious (although not the most naturally intelligent) in my generation of my extended family and made great grades and did the best in college academic/career wise.

Most of my extended family is very comfortably middle class to pretty wealthy upper middle class. We are Asian, so maybe my problem is related to culture. We are all also very close, closer than any other extended family group I know. I am the 8th youngest out of about 15, so middle range. I have fourteen aunts and uncles and three grandparents. Big family! They're awesome for the most part.

When I graduated from college I decided against pursuing modeling (bad career long-term and a waste of my degree) and go into corporate life instead. I landed a job as an assistant planner for a major luxury retailer (think Bergdorfs/Neiman's/Saks/Barneys... like expensive as fuck shit). I now live in NYC and make 50k which frankly isn't great money considering the insane living expenses. I've been at my first job for a month. I live like my nest egg doesn't exist really, I'm very low maintenance and so I'm living pretty below my means. Bagged lunches, lower than usual rent in a not ""glamorous"" neighborhood, the works. I've already used my job perks to get my mom and two grandmas gorgeous high-end wallets (think Louis Vuitton) for Christmas and my dad a nice shirt or something as a thank you. I've already dropped about $550 on this. Way out of my means (minus the egg's nest) but worth it considering how nice my parents were to pay for things like college. My siblings/cousins asked to pitch in for the Christmas gifts since it's the nicest gift my grandparents/mom would have ever received, so maybe I'll end up having spent less.

Onto the actual problem: So my mom called me a week ago (and has nagged me about it since) that I NEED to buy all 16 aunts and uncles plus my grandparents separate gifts as a ""thank you"" for treating me well when growing up (I wasn't given any special treatment... we were all treated well equally). She demands I use my own money, says because of my nest's egg I can afford it, and it's custom to do so. She also demands all the presents be ""small but nice"" gifts from my company's store. And that I need to do this by Thanksgiving when I come back home.

Ok, first of all, I'm fine doing this gifting thing as a thank you. BUT, regardless of my nest's egg or not, I have FOURTEEN aunts and uncles and three grandparents. And if you have ever been to the stores that are like where I work.... it's VERY expensive. I asked her what she means by ""nice and small"" and she says she expects maybe $80-100 for the grandparents and $40-50 for each aunt and uncle. I did the math, that's around $800 to $1000 total. Yes, I have a nest's egg, but I still think that's an INSANE amount of money considering I don't make much anymore. I'm trying to use my money for investment purposes and this is why I've been frugal as fuck with it since I was a child. 

Plus, I'm not the first kid to get my ""adult"" job. Several of my siblings/cousins who are older than me landed jobs too, some a year or two before I did. No kid has ever had to do this. I don't get why I'm the only one getting this demand. Now because of my ""glamrous"" job, my nests egg, and my corporate discount (which even post-discount it's still insanely expensive stuff at this store...) *I* have to?! And only me?? My cousin who has been working full time four years ahead of me never had to, and he lives at home! I have rent and shit to pay and I really don't want to dip into my savings to do this. Plus, I think if anyone really deserves gifts in that price range, it's my parents who paid for my shit during my college years. Which is why I bought those nice gifts already for Christmas. 

I called my sister to ask if what my mom was requesting was reasonable, and she said it's perfectly reasonable and equated me to being a ""scrooge"". She says ""you're rich"" and that I need to loosen the purse strings a little and that $1000 is perfectly reasonable considering I'm only to do this once. Then she goes on that modeling was handed over to me and I never had to work hard for it so what's the big deal?

Yes I was born with the right height and face. But I also had to compromise a ton of schooling opportunities to work, made far less friends in college because I never had time to, and dieted a SHIT ton since I was fifteen to keep my weight in check. I still networked the shit out of my school and worked very hard to get to where I am now, so I'm a bit insulted that she says it was all ""handed"" to me and now I should give back as a thank you.

Maybe I am Scrooge, but I think the best compromise is that I do the gift thing (fine, I'll be the only kid that does it but whatever...) BUT I will buy very small things like household decor or Christmas ornaments for each couple (aunt & uncle). I might buy something more reasonably priced, like cosmetics, for my grandmas. Maybe a hat for grandpa. I don't know, I need to check out the store. My absolute max for everything will instead be $400 or $500. I can pull this off if I don't do this at Thanksgiving but Christmas instead, since my job will allow for even bigger discounts on the same items anyway. 

My sister proceeded to call me uptight and my mom said she's disappointed in me. I have to deal with their bullshit at Thanksgiving... am I a cheapskate?

TLDR: My mom is demanding I spend  $800-$1000 on gifts for my extended family adults as a ""thank you"" and claims its a customary thing to do since I now have a grown up job. I'm the ONLY one being demanded to do this, possibly since my job seems more ""glamorous"" with perks and I can technically afford it. I think she's crazy, but what about you?
