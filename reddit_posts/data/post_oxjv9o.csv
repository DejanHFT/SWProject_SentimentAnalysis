What does high level mathematical study give us?,comet0y0ursenses,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/oxjv9o/what_does_high_level_mathematical_study_give_us/,9,20,May sound like a stupid question to some but I’m having trouble understanding how new advanced mathematical study is used to explain things like how AI works. Is it kinda like if simple addition didn’t exists and a farmer was struggling to know how many apples he had. A mathematician would discover “hey if you add one apple and another you have two apples” which revolutionises apple stock taking?
