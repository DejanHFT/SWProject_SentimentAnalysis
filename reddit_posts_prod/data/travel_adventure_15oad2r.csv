Colombia: Couple compromise between an adventurous traveler and a resort traveler,Conscious-Love-5903,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15oad2r/colombia_couple_compromise_between_an_adventurous/,5,1,"I'm a very adventurous traveler, and I'm comfortable traveling to remote locations with just my backpack and basic accommodations. I usually slow travel for about a month. My partner has limited travel experience, has only stayed out of the country at large resorts, and hasn’t been out of the country for more than a week at a time. 

I’m trying to plan a compromise beach vacation to Colombia for 10 nights this January or February. Here is what I have so far:  

* 2 nights in Medellin (one on the way in, and one on the way out) 
* 2 nights in Cartagena (culture and food) 
* For the remaining 6 nights I'd like to relax on a beach within a 1-day journey from Cartagena 

I'm looking for a destination that is on the tourist trail enough to have nice hotels (comfortable accommodations, pool, etc.) but not so busy that it feels overcrowded and/or like a cruise ship destination. Good food, nightlife, and outdoor activities are a bonus – but having a beautiful white sand beach and a nice hotel are the priority. I’m thinking honeymoon vibes. 

Thank you in advance for any recommendations!!!  "
