How can I (27F) better support my fiancé (32M) after he was laid off?,Every_Mortgage_1369,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1965821/how_can_i_27f_better_support_my_fiancé_32m_after/,9,3,"
Hi all! Burner account but some basic information: fiancé and I will have been together 7 years this March and got engaged June 2023. 

 My fiancé was laid off at the end of 2022 in a large RIF in the tech industry. He has been able to find contract work for some temporary projects but not able to find full time permanent work. So far I have encouraged him to start his own business with web design and management for small businesses as we know several people who have requested his services but he doesn’t seem motivated to do that as it’s not what he does in the corporate world. (Capable, just doesn’t want to do it) 

Finances are not a concern (for the household) as I make 6 figures and we have no children at this time. Our mortgage and bills are taken care of but of course it would be more comforting if we were both working. At this time he does food delivery (DoorDash and other platforms) and teaching a boot camp in the industry. Making some money but not what he wants. 

I’m starting to get weary because he doesn’t feel comfortable getting married (do not want a wedding so not concerned about financing that) until he has a job and doesn’t want to start having kids until we are married, have a rental property and $15k saved. I personally think that is unreasonable and I’m not interested in checking all those boxes to begin having kids. (I do realize that sounds selfish)

My issue is, there does not seem to be motivation on his part to change his financial situation yet he has all these stipulations on us moving forward. He recently had his phone shut off for a day because he missed a phone payment but purchased weed, which he does often. He says he keeps applying for jobs and not hearing much back but the man has a masters degree. I don’t understand how he is not able to figure how to elevate from here. 

I’m not sure if I’m being too harsh or not supportive enough with my patience, but what do yall advise I do to support or motivate him? I am not a a stage of leaving him (so please refrain from saying that) as these issues have only come up since he was laid off which I know was a tank to his spirit. I’ve never been laid off before so I am trying to be empathetic to his emotional needs from that but emotionally I’m getting tired because what I want feels like it’s on pause. I have asked him this directly and he says there’s nothing I can do… Thank you if you read this far. 

TL;DR - I am requesting advice on how to support fiancé who was laid off but doesn’t seem motivated to change situation after over a year of inconsistent employment."
