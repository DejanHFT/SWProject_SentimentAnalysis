Inspiration/Advice on creating a goal for my protagonist,GordopV,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18n6eij/inspirationadvice_on_creating_a_goal_for_my/,11,2,"Hello, I have started writing a protagonist. And I am really unsure about what goal I want him to have. The setting is in a Fantasy world that takes place in it's own universe. I have not really set any limitations for my world yet since I want to get into the specifics after figuring out the general plotline. I want his goal to be very grand and important. Something similar to luffy in one piece becoming joyboy/king of pirates or Aang in avatar the last airbender being the one to unite all the nations (the avatar). But I do not want it to be the-chosen-one trope/fate but more of a self-written legacy. Are there any mythological figures or historical figures you know that I could look at for inspiration? Or any tips on how to tackle this?"
