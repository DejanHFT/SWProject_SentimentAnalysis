Help with finishing wood,NoMeasurement7979,https://i.redd.it/xd5zpfk3578c1.png,4,4,"Hi all! Total newbie here to the woodworking wold. I'm trying to finish off a piece of furniture that has a red oak veneer. I was playing around with swatches but I'm running into problems with finishing the piece. The goal was to get a consistent dark brown color. I initially tried some stain (varathane dark walnut) but found that it soaked into the grain too much. I played around with other stains as well, but still having that issue. It's just the way that red oak behaves with stain I guess. I then tried using just plain acrylic paint from a kids painting kit (spur of the moment idea) and achieved the exact look that I was going for....I hate the idea of painting (prefer staining) so I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions? Is painting the only way to achieve this look given the open grain of the wood? TIA!"
