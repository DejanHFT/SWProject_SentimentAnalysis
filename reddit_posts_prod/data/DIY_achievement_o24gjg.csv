How to add wheels to a storage shelf.,caligirrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/o24gjg/how_to_add_wheels_to_a_storage_shelf/,68,221,"I have a metal storage shelf in my garage.  It sits right in front of the breaker box, probably not the safest option but that's what I got.  While I can drag it away from the wall for breaker box access its heavy.  The legs are skinny and round and would fit in to some type of sleeve attached to wheels but my google skills have come up empty.  Does something like this exist?

It was suggested I share a link of the leg. [Leg](https://imgur.com/Q5tsnUl)"
