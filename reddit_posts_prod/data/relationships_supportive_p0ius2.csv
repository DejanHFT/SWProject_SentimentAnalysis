My father is not supportive of me getting a new job and it's heartbreaking,Torbuttone,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/p0ius2/my_father_is_not_supportive_of_me_getting_a_new/,9,2,"My father gave me (24m) a job in the reaseach industry when I was 17. I am so thankful for it, but he doesn't want me to go away from he old job. Don't get me wrong, it's a well-payed, chill, open and proceprous job, but it is I feel like a loser that I'll spend all my life working at my dad's and living at his place.

The new job has a similar wage, is in a different city, is and international company, has a new team forming and my soon-to-be girlfriend and friends work there.

I'm not sure. Is it time to move out of my nest?

TL;DR my former employer - dad - is not supportive of my wants to get a new job. I want to get it to move out and stay with my girl. What do you think?"
