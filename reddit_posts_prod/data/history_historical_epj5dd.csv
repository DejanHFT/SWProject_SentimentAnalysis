"There are many movies about wealthy, debonair individuals who concoct elaborate heists and/or commit similar forms of larceny mostly for the thrill and allure of doing so rather than because they need the money. Are there any historical figures who fit this model?",miscellonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/epj5dd/there_are_many_movies_about_wealthy_debonair/,269,2386,I was thinking about movies like Oceanâ€™s 11 or The Thomas Crown Affair and how this model of the upper-class individual who engages in high-stakes theft for fun seems pretty unrealistic. But are there real-life historical figures who could be said to be the basis for this mold?
