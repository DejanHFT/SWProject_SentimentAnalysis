Who is your Literary Love?,uglybutterfly025,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6qpf8c/who_is_your_literary_love/,61,12,"I was thinking back on all the books I've read and come to find that there are still come characters that I still have warm fuzzy feelings for. I searched the sub to see if anyone else had asked this question to the group and only got results from anywhere between 1 and 5 years ago so I figured I'd give it a shot again lol 

Personally, I find my heart wrenching toward Percy from *The Lightening Thief* series, Ren from *The Tiger's Curse* series, and Four from the *Allegiant* series. It's really been a while since I've read any of these books, but for some reason when I think about that time when I did read them and the way I felt about those characters, feelings definitely linger.

Who was/is your literary crush? 

Has it changed as you've aged? "
