Mastery Learning & Autonomy,Caaarrlll27,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/q8g4p0/mastery_learning_autonomy/,0,0,"I teach 11-12th grade Chemistry and Environmental Science. I have always been one to advocate for student autonomy and the ""self-driven learning is the best education"" pedagogy, which has lead me to the mastery learning tactic. This year (2.5 months in) I have seen the obvious and expected issue of student negligence and lack of motivation. For those familiar with the mastery learning strategy, how does an instructor turn this attitude around? Is full autonomy strictly out of the equation (i.e. is scaffolding required given the inherent failings of the American education system)? Any assistance is greatly appreciated."
