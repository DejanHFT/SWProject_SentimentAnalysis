Hi! We're a group of students from the University of Washington entrepreneurship class, taught by Alan Leong in Bothell, WA. We're working on an innovative business model in the Christmas industry and need your help! For our project, we need to interview 100 people from the United States.

**Would you dedicate 10 minutes of your time to help us understand how you celebrate Christmas and if our approach serves your pain points?**

Ideal candidates are the ones who:

&#x200B;

1. Celebrate Christmas  
 
2. Are willing to take a short 10-minute interview  
 
3. Put up a Christmas tree during the festive season  
 

We really need the support of the Christmas community and count on volunteers to help us!
