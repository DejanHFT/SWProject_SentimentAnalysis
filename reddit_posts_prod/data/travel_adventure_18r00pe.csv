Hostel stay with G Adventures?,Thatothergayguy94,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18r00pe/hostel_stay_with_g_adventures/,6,1,So I’ve heard a lot of good things about G Adventures and I’m planning on going on a 30ish day trip to SE Asia. I’m just wondering what hostels with G Adventures would be like? Are they mixed dorms? Single sex? I’ve never stayed in a hostel before and I’m kinda nervous at the thought of. I feel that doing a hostel would force me to be more social and make more friends. Just need some advice lol
