Entrepreneurship or business?,nnathanalexander,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/pbmjqx/entrepreneurship_or_business/,1,1,I’m 15 years old and aspire to be a successful entrepreneur. However i’m stuck on what to do at uni. I’m not sure whether i should do a degree in business management and entrepreneurship or just business management itself. I’ve read a few articles but haven’t come to a conclusion. Could somebody please help?
