"Do we have ""scent detection"" technology?",wreckoning,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1glgw6/do_we_have_scent_detection_technology/,16,12,"We have binoculars, microscopes, devices that amplify hearing, sonar, etc. Do we have anything that enhances scent, or devices that can read scents for us? Is that something that's in development? - I don't mean something that can tell if the milk's gone bad or not. But precision instruments that with time could rival the power of a dog's nose."
