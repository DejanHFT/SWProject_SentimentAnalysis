"In 1979, just a few years after the U.S. withdrawal, the Vietnamese Army engaged in a brief border war with China that killed 60,000 soldiers in just 4 weeks. What are some other lesser-known conflicts that had huge casualty figures despite little historical impact?",stratohornet,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/cvz6c8/in_1979_just_a_few_years_after_the_us_withdrawal/,1092,6239,"Between February and March 1979, the Chinese Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army launched an expedition into northern Vietnam in support of the Cambodian Khmer Rouge, which had been waging a war against Vietnam. The resulting border war killed over 30,000 soldiers on each side in the span of a month. This must have involved some incredibly fierce fighting, rivaling some of the bloodiest battles of World War II, and yet, it yielded few long-term strategic gains for either side.

Are there any other examples of obscure conflicts with very high casualty figures?"
