What is your favorite historical period and why?,Yellow_Watermelon_,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/nowjnb/what_is_your_favorite_historical_period_and_why/,72,41,"Itâ€™s late and I feel like nerding out, indulge me. Tell me your favorite historical periods, or the most interesting and why.

Personally mine is the Song Dynasty. The rise of Confucianism and Buddhism. The reinstatement of the civil service exam and a new reformed government. I find it so fascinating because of how different it is from American history. Like a whole new world of unique fashion and traditions, foot binding, superstition, emperors. A scene I can study for the rest of my life and still have yet to fully understand. A beautifully complex yet simple time period which my ancestors knew practically nothing of."
