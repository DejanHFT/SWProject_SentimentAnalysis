Is it possible to focus natural light into a high density solar beam with modern technology?,cptncivil,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7733md/is_it_possible_to_focus_natural_light_into_a_high/,82,411,"1. I've read John Ringo's Try Rising Series. The starting point for this question. (P.S. I'm saying beam instead of L.A.S.E.R)
2. I also caught a decent [xkcd](https://what-if.xkcd.com/145/) on the subject of focusing natural sunlight into a tight beam and *basically calling it complete BS*. 
*3. I'm wondering if there's any way you can use fiber optics or any other material to collect a large amount of naturally occurring light to condense it into a tighter beam.* I realize beam may be subjective, but understand it to have minimal diffraction/loss of energy over long distances and the spread to be less than .001% type of thing. 
4. Could it be possible to use highly confined magnetic-fields to bend the directions of light into tighter beams, sort of like a solenoid? 
5. Finally, (stepping into a bit of Sci-fi), **If** we could master creating highly localized gravitational fields, would it then be possible to take large amounts of light from a source like the sun and focus it into long continuous beams, since we know through gravitational lensing that we can seriously affect the trajectory of light? 

Thank you, "
