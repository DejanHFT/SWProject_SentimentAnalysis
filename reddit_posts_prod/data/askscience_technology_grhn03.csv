AskScience AMA Series: Hello Reddit! We're a group of climate researchers and engineers working on new technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Ask us anything!,AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/grhn03/askscience_ama_series_hello_reddit_were_a_group/,452,4325,"We're Nan Ransohoff and Ryan Orbuch from the Climate team at **Stripe**. Our work to mitigate the threat of climate change focuses on an underexplored part of the problem-removing carbon from the atmosphere directly, which is essential if the world is to meet its warming targets. Last week, after a rigorous search and review from independent scientific experts, we [announced](https://stripe.com/blog/first-negative-emissions-purchases) Stripe's first purchases from four negative emissions projects with great potential. We hope this will help create a large and competitive market for carbon removal. 

**CarbonCure**: I'm Rob Niven, Founder and CEO of [CarbonCure Technologies](https://www.carboncure.com/). Our technology chemically repurposes waste CO_2 during the concrete manufacturing process by mineralizing it into calcium carbonate (CaCO_3)-reducing greenhouse gas emissions, lowering material costs, and improving concrete quality. The technology is already being used at 200+ concrete plants from Miami to Singapore to build hundreds of construction projects from highrises to airports.

**Charm Industrial**: We're Kelly Hering and Shaun Meehan, founding engineers at [Charm Industrial](https://charmindustrial.com/). We have created a novel process for converting waste biomass into bio-oil, which we then inject deep underground as negative emissions-creating a permanent geologic store for carbon. 

**Climeworks**: I'm Jan Wurzbacher, co-CEO of [Climeworks](https://www.climeworks.com/). We use renewable geothermal energy and waste heat to capture CO_2 directly from the air, concentrate it, and permanently sequester it underground in rock formations. 

**Project Vesta**: We're Eric Matzner and Tom Green from [Project Vesta](https://projectvesta.org/). Project Vesta captures CO_2 by using an abundant, naturally occurring mineral called olivine. Ocean waves grind down the olivine, which captures atmospheric CO_2 from within the ocean and stabilizes it as limestone on the seafloor.

We'll be answering questions from 10am Pacific / 1pm Eastern (17 UT). Ask us all anything about our work!

EDIT: We've now closed the AMA. This has been a lot of fun. Thanks so much everyone for the incredibly thoughtful questions! Apologies that we didn't have time to get to them all. You can read more about the projects on their websites (linked above). You can also find all of Stripe's source materials – including our criteria for choosing the projects and all project applications – here: https://github.com/stripe/negative-emissions-source-materials. Please reach out to us if you'd like to work together on this effort or to give us any feedback - we're at climate@stripe.com."
