Travel Insurance and Experience with G Adventures,samwisegg89,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/110n7od/travel_insurance_and_experience_with_g_adventures/,5,3,"Hello Travelers, 

I am planning a Costa Rica trip with G Adventures and wanted to check if anyone has used them in the past and how your experience has been? Additionally, where do most people purchase travel insurance from? I generally plan my own travel, but this is the first time i am considering group travel, so looking for tips from travel fam. :)"
