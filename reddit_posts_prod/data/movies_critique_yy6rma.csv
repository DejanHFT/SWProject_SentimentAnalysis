Favorite Tarantino dialogue?,Alcatrazepam,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/yy6rma/favorite_tarantino_dialogue/,238,69,"Obviously there are so many great choices but gun to my head I probably have to choose Bills lines about Clark Kent being Superman’s critique of the human race. It really fits in that pop culture element Tarantino does so well while making a cool observation and developing character 

Tied with that I probably would say the whole opening interrogation of inglorious bastards

What about youse? There’s no shortage (and lines from movies he didn’t direct are welcome too)"
