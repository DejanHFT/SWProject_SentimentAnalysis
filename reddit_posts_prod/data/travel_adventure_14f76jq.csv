Has anyone here done a G adventures tour?,Fun_Secret_2069,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/14f76jq/has_anyone_here_done_a_g_adventures_tour/,12,3,"I know this question has been asked in the past, however I'm more interested in a couple more direct questions since I'm already booked for a tour this August travelling from Nairobi to Johannesburg.

&#x200B;

Has anyone done a trip with g adventures before that is tall? By tall I mean really quite a bit taller than average (I'm 6""7).

I enquired about the lengths of tents and they said that they are 2.4m long which is absolutely fine for me however I'm also interested in certain other things such as will I be alright with the leg room in the majority of the vehicles that they use? And will my height be an issue with any other parts of the trip?

&#x200B;

Also I know that obviously this will change very much from trip to trip but for people who have been on a '18-39' year olds trip which direction was the age generally skewed in? I've only just finished school (18) and so I'd hope that everyone won't be at the top end of this range, although I do get on with anyone and I'd imagine it wouldn't be too much of an issue.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any other recommendations or feedback from their trips which could be beneficial to me, do share please! Thank you "
