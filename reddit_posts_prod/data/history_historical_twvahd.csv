Is the common “merry medieval inn” trope historically accurate?,spark8000,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/twvahd/is_the_common_merry_medieval_inn_trope/,32,97,"By “merry medieval inn” I mean the stereotypical inn you see in fantasy movies or books, a place with rooms to rent and a public tavern full of life, drinking, and dancing. 

I was watching a video breaking down some medieval history when the narrator, in passing, mentioned how the idea of inns being places like “The Prancing Pony” from Lord of the Rings, places with rooms available and a public common area serving drinks and food, was a fabrication. This surprised me as it doesn’t, on the surface level at least, seem to be a completely unbelievable concept. The narrator didn’t go on to explain further, so I was curious if there is any historical accuracy to this common trope or if it is truly a pure fabrication?"
