The most chaotic cinema screening of E.T. in history happened last night,dorgoth12,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/11ivwwf/the_most_chaotic_cinema_screening_of_et_in/,89,2295,"In my city in Brazil there's been a month of Spielberg films showing at the cultural centre. Me and my wife went to the screening of E.T last night. 

So it was meant to be original English audio with Portuguese subtitles. And for maybe 20 minutes all was well...

At a point the subtitles stopped. Then when they came back they kept going from where they had stopped, about 5 minutes behind the film. This was already funny enough but then the audio track started to lag behind the video.
Just slightly at first but slowly it kept getting more out of sync.
At this point we had video, then audio a second later, then the appropriate subtitles 5 minutes later!! Then the subtitles changed to French!! 

But wait there's more!!!

The film stops and someone tells us they're trying to fix it.

They rewind 20 minutes and away we go. WITH FRENCH AUDIO.
The audience reaction was up until this point mixed. Understandably parents who brought kids were annoyed, and people who couldn't understand English were just confused without knowing what was happening. All the while us and a number of others were having the time of our damn lives and guffawing loudly.
But at the French language portion of the film we all about got the joke.

The English audio returned in normal sync with subtitles stuck 5 mins behind still.
This continues for a few minutes and the lights come up and the film shuts off. The cinema literally gave up on successfully showing us E.T. today.

As an extra delightful detail... The film was being played on VLC player! At one point the film was in a small window being dragged around the screen, little Elliots face zooming around like an old DVD screensaver.

We went into the film thinking we'd end up in tears. We didn't expect them to be of laughter.
Magical. Thank you Spielberg!"
