Who/what inspired you to start writing?,LoveyDoveySkills,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/19bj7bt/whowhat_inspired_you_to_start_writing/,69,36,"It could be a famous author, a family member, a book you read and really liked, it could be anything!

For me, what inspired me to write was school. I had started writing fanfictions for a while in middle school I believe, because I wanted these characters to have happier endings and more romance. I didn't really write anything that was my own. 

In 7th grade, I wrote about thinking I had appendicitis for my English class. I got to be a little creative with it, and I got a good grade. 

What really really inspired me though, was when I had to write a fanfiction chapter to a book as an assignment in 8th grade. We had just finished reading the book, Unwind, and we needed a writing assignment to go with it. The teacher came up with the idea of writing a chapter to it from the perspective of one of the characters who hadn't already been the narrator of a chapter (for those who haven't read Unwind, all of the different chapters have different narrators, there are definitely reoccurring ones, but if I remember correctly I don't think any of them narrate for more than one chapter in a row). I really liked this idea, I already had some experience in fanfiction. I went over the word limit a little bit, but I talked to the teacher and she said it was okay. So, I turned it in, and she told me she really liked it, a long with some other stuff and mentioning that I had good writing potential. 

So, I started to write some stories that were completely my own. I never finished any of them, but I've got great ideas. I'm 17 now, and a junior in high school, and my goal is to at least finish (maybe even publish) a book by the time I turn 18 in October."
