Uplifting Punk?,of_mice_and_meh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/4rwd6s/uplifting_punk/,26,6,"I'm looking to put together an Uplifting Punk playlist on Spotify and could use some help with song ideas. So far I only have ""Never Walk Alone"" by The Adicts and ""Fall Back Down"" by Rancid. I appreciate any suggestions."
