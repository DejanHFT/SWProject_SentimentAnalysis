"Thanks to whoever recommended ""Lonesome Dove""",ExtremeTEE,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15hgwnh/thanks_to_whoever_recommended_lonesome_dove/,226,861,"In fact it was someone thanking someone else, so let me continue this chain!  
I had this in my collection for while but resisted reading it because I don\`t really like westerns and it sounded sort of like a love story but WOW once I started it I couldn\`t stop. It is incredibly well written with well rounded, flawed characters and a driving narrative. Not to mention a believable setting and recreation of forgotten time.   
The story is full of surprises, some of which left me shocked and avoids any predictable beats or tidy resolution.   
Right now I can\`t wait to watch the TV adaptation, they seem to have got the casting just right, eventhough Gus definitely had flowing grey hair!"
