"Me [24 F] with my boyfriend [25 M] of one year, I want to finally take an overseas trip in March after years of not being able to travel; I can't believe how un-supportive my usually supportive BF is being.",Wantt0travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wwrdd/me_24_f_with_my_boyfriend_25_m_of_one_year_i_want/,286,183,"Some background: I have really, really wanted to travel out of the U.S. since I was 18, but I've never been able to go. I've tried to plan several trips, but they have all fallen through for one reason or another. When I was in college, I was signed up for a study abroad trip to Italy that fell through less than a month before I was supposed to leave. A few months ago I was supposed to go on a trip to several European countries with my cousins, but ended up having to pull out because I got offered an amazing job that was very rigid on my start date.

My boyfriend, on the other hand, is very well-traveled. He took several trips abroad while he was in college. He's been to Denmark. He's been to Jamaica. He spent three months traveling around Italy, France and England.

I should probably note that my BF and I have been LDR since September, but we've been able to see each other several times since then.

Time keeps passing, and it really bothers me that I haven't traveled despite having a great desire to. I'll admit, I'm probably unreasonably upset about the fact that I've never been able to travel. I feel like the best way for me to solve this discontent - rather than just accept the fact that I've never traveled and hope something works out for me eventually - is to plan a trip and **go**.

I have to get my vacation time submitted to my boss by the end of this week. I get five days of vacation, which isn't a whole lot, but I figured I could make an international trip in that timeframe.

I started researching trips I could take on my budget, allotted vacation time and travel situation. I found a week-long Contiki trip to two European countries that seems perfect for me. (I know, I know ... say what you will about Contiki, but from my research I think it's the best option for me traveling solo).

I brought this up with my boyfriend a couple days ago. Usually, he is very supportive of any endeavors I want to take on. But this time, I got the feeling that he didn't want me to go. He got really quiet, and just said, ""Well, do your research ...""

I brought it up with him a couple hours ago, since I have to get my vacation request in soon. I told him that I am really interested in this trip, that I can afford it and that the dates would work out perfectly with how many vacation days I get.

The conversation up until that point had been lighthearted and pleasant. But after I brought this up, he again got really quiet. When he spoke, his tone had changed and was more monotone.

I got quiet and tried to end the conversation. He asked if something was wrong, and I said, ""You sound like you don't want me to go on this trip."" He immediately countered, ""Did I ever say that?"" I replied that no, he didn't say those exact words, but that he was acting incredibly unsupportive.

So he begins telling me all the reasons why he thinks this trip is a bad idea. He says I should wait until I have more vacation time and am less stressed to take an international trip. That I should save more money. He says a week isn't long enough to take a truly ""full"" European trip.

I tell him that this is something I'm tired of waiting on. He says he thinks I'm just making a rash decision because I'm fed up with never having traveled out of the country.

I could recount everything we said, but that was the bulk of it. He also said I need to ""think this through"" and ""do my research.""

I said, ""What makes you think I haven't thought it through? What makes you think I haven't done my research?""

Finally, we hung up, both of us not in the best mood, because I had to go to work.

I'm really upset and haven't even gotten much work done.

He texted me and asked how work is. I replied, ""work is fine,"" and then sent this:

""I'm feeling really stupid. I don't understand why you're being so cynical about this trip I want to go on. It's not a decision I'm making on a whim, and it's something I've researched. A week might not sound like a long time, but I know people who've done it and you probably do, too. Yes, I'll use up most of my vacation time, but September is less than a year away and I'll get much more time then.

""But whatever, it doesn't matter because I probably won't go, anyway.""

He hasn't responded and I don't really expect him to.

So, Reddit ... Am I being incredibly naive and stupid by wanting to go on this Contiki trip? How do I move forward with this? Now I'm not so sure about going on this trip ... Ugh I just feel really dumb about the whole thing.

Thanks

   
**tl;dr**: I want to take a week-long solo trip to Europe in March. Traveling out of the country is something I have wanted to do for years, but have never been able to. My BF knows this and knows how much it would mean for me to travel. However, he hasn't been supportive of me going on this trip, and it's making me really upset. Not sure what to do."
