"Atheists, help me understand you",what_gives,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i78qz/atheists_help_me_understand_you/,4014,440,"So Christians get the satisfaction that the people they convert are being ""saved"". They believe they are called to spread the Gospel, ""the good news"", to everyone. This saves their soul. What is the mission/purpose of these atheist organizations i see every now and then? Is it more of a social club? And if so...what the hell do you discuss? How stupid religious people are? I find it similar to not believing in Santa Claus. Of course i don't believe in Santa Claus, but i don't see anyone starting a non-santa claus club and making it their mission to ruin a bunch of 5 year olds' day. Why not just leave the 5 year olds alone and not have a club?

I know this is gonna get downvoted to non-existent hell but i'm honestly just trying to understand the atheist mission some of you are so passionate about.

Edit: Punching self in the face for using Santa Claus analogy BUT on that topic, do you celebrate christmas? if so, why perpetuate an event stemming from the birth of christ?

Christmas comes from the winter solstice...got it. Been said, been heard.

I've never felt so afraid and as a part of Reddit as i do right now haha. Yay for *most* of us sharing civilized discussion about such a controversial topic :)

Edit: okay, maybe not ""stemming"" but celebrating rather

Edit: This thread has been EXTREMELY enlightening. Points have been made and i have been made aware of several perspectives/ideas/thoughts i've never encountered. I definitely have a lot more respect for everyone's views on this subject. Thank you for responses. I apologize to the poster's claiming this is just a post for old questions phrased in a new way to be clever. Obviously, I had no idea this thread would reach front page. I also apologize for my lack of rebuttals and replies, i've been taking it all in. I made the mistake of editing in some new phrasing and questions and seem to have insulted people further, NOT my intention. I sincerely want to be exposed to a group's views that i haven't quite understood until now. 

One more question. A lot of you are unaware of these mysterious atheist organizations i speak of...do you think that's the problem(with politics/government)? Religious groups are very organized therefore can get a lot their beliefs imposed on everyone. It would make sense(or at least to me) for there to be a huge atheist/anti-theist/whatever organization. Why isn't there and also why aren't you in an organization as such? Do you think atheist's organizational skills are due to a general apathy? It doesn't seem so as i'm reading all of these comments. 

My comments are more me playing ""devil's"" advocate to get some good discussion going than anything.<sarcasm>I appreciate a lot of you calling me a moron/idiot and saying nothing else in your post. Thank you for your contribution</sarcasm>"
