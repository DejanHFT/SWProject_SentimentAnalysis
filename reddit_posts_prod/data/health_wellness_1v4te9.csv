Well this is embarrassing.,assissue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/1v4te9/well_this_is_embarrassing/,5,2,"How do you tell the difference between an Anal Fissure and Hemorrhoids?

I've been experiencing this for about a week and half. Pain / blood when taking a bowel movement. The pain and bleeding isnt strictly when I have movements now, it has become very uncomfortable. All day yesterday I had pain, It hurts to pass gas, it hurts when theres a slight amount of pressure. The bleeding comes and goes, not strictly following a bowel movement.  Saturday night I had a bowel movement, then sunday morning there was bleeding. 

 I've had some issues with bleeding and some pain in the past, but its usually gone within a day or two. 

I'm not constipated, I usually go a couple times a day. 

The blood is very bright red. Sometimes there is blood on the stool, sometimes it is just on the toilet paper. 

Should I visit my doctor, or try a home remedy first?
