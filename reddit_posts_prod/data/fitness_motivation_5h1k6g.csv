How do I help motivate my SO to workout with me?,JeskaLouise,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5h1k6g/how_do_i_help_motivate_my_so_to_workout_with_me/,75,29,"I'm having a hard time with getting my husband to work out and I'm wondering if there's some simple things that we can do together at home. long story short when he was a freshman in high school his appendix ruptured and it was so bad that they had to open him up and it's left him with a giant scar that is through his belly button all the way down to his pelvis so he's convinced that he's not able to build muscle since they cut right through muscles there. He knows that his family has a history of weight issues so he wants to be better at working out but I think that mentally he's dealing with some self conscious issues? 
 The other issue is that he came from a none athletic family and I am very athletic and physically fit from 6+ years of cross country,track and now as a dance teacher I stay in decent shape-but that doesn't mean I'm at my peak physical shape that I want to be at but he still thinks that we aren't evenly matched to work out together .

I'm wondering what are some simple things that would put us on the same playing field and get him more comfortable with working out with me? I've worked out alot in the past so I know a lot but he isn't going for the simple lets do crunches together thing. Thanks!
