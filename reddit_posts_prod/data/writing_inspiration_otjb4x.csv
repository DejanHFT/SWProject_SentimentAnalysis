I discovered an interesting way to gather inspiration!,MCKtheMan,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/otjb4x/i_discovered_an_interesting_way_to_gather/,16,56,"I walked into a Barnes and Noble today, bored out of my mind. All my plans were canceled and I wanted to do something. I walked into Barnes and Noble thinking of what to do, when it became clear that I wanted to write. But what? So I had an idea:

I grabbed five books off the shelf. Random books. I turned to page 14 with each one (although it can really be any page. I just chose 14 because it’s my lucky number) and looked for the first complete sentence. I’d write each one down and used those as the basis of my inspiration for figuring out what to write. Here are the sentences I gathered:

“Perhaps they’re having such a good time they stayed on.”

“Are you there?”

“Again- we are much obliged.”

“I’m dressed as spring.”

“Sutter couldn’t find his way from Big Sandy to Little Sandy.”

And I started writing. I don’t use those sentences exactly but I use it as my inspiration

Figured I’d share this with y’all. Maybe you can give it a shot.

Edit for clarity"
