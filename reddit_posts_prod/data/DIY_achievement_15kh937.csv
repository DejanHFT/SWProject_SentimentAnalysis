How do paint/dye this bracelet white? (already dyed leather),sleepingbedbug,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15kh937,5,2,"Hello, please help me find a way to permanently dye/paint this leather bracelet white. Is this achievable without ruining it? The seller said it's not possible. What would permanently stick to it? Paint, dye, spray paint? Thank you!"
