Best single movie frame to help sell a home cinema.,jezzac_2000,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/184zqno/best_single_movie_frame_to_help_sell_a_home_cinema/,498,350,"Hey Guys..

UK Estate agent here....I am selling a house with an in built cinema with a large screen.  I want to include a photo of the room with a movie playing.  So the question is...

What is the best single movie frame that can impress buyers?

As this will be for general public viewing, nothing gory or gratuitous....but something iconic!

My own thoughts are...

1. Opening of Star Wars with the the underside of the Destroyer.
2. The Man with No Name staring through the camera.
3. Buzz & Woody flying through the sky."
