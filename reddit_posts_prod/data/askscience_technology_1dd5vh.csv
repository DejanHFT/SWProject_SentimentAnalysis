Would it be possible to build a lava boat that is able to carry passengers with current technology?,wats8976,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1dd5vh/would_it_be_possible_to_build_a_lava_boat_that_is/,34,32,"Engineering Question:


Would it be possible to construct a boat with today's technologies that would be able to carry human passengers across a sea of molten rock without destroying the boat or killing the passengers?


Would the molten rock freeze to the bottom of the boat and progressively make it heavier and heavier until it sank?


What would such a boat look like? Would the design be significantly different from its water counterparts?


Could the ship be powered by a heat-pump between the hull and the surrounding air?"
