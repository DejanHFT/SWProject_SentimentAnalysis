"Lost 35 lbs. so far, my thoughts on diet soda, as well as low-carb dieting [before and after pic inside].",Lard4Breakfast,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/jl0fl/lost_35_lbs_so_far_my_thoughts_on_diet_soda_as/,193,119,"Hey r/fitness, I will start out by thanking this great community for giving me the information and motivation to get fit and stay healthy.

[Here is the before and after picture as promised.](http://i.imgur.com/T89O3.jpg)

I still plan to lose another 10-20 lbs. over time. I lost all of the weight over about 3 months (roughly 2.8 lbs. a week, slightly faster than what is recommended). 

What I did:

**Diet:**

I initially started by counting calories, and lost around 10 pounds that way. At the beginning I cared little about what *kind* of food I ate and more about *how much* I ate. This worked for a while but I got bored with it, and tried switching to a low-carbohydrate diet. I personally liked this a lot more. I ate anywhere from 20-50 carbs a day, and the rest was mostly cheese, chicken, beef, and bacon (protein and fat). I also ate plenty of vegetables. I would recommend trying this diet if you aren't too keen on counting calories. Most people on this diet say that its better to eat mostly fat rather than protein, I personally mixed it up. Some days mostly protein, some days mostly fat, some day ~50-50.

This is not the only diet that works obviously, but I did work for me. So did counting calories. There are plenty of options out there, pick what works for you. 

**Cardio + Strength training:**

I did mostly weight training during the day and occasional high intensity cardio at night. Stair running is excellent if you have access to a local football field or something similar. As far as strength training, I'm no expert but I've seen progress. I trained roughly 3-4 days a week, targeting 1-3 muscle groups each time. I also got some home dumbells with adjustable weight. Kind of like [these.](http://bowflex-dumbbells.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/d38a5_Bowflex_Dumbbell_41ks803mx4L.jpg)

**My opinion on Diet drinks**

Personally, I think the idea that diet drinks will make you fat is ridiculous. They contain 0 calories. During this process I drank anywhere between 1-5 diet drinks a day, and had no problem losing weight. It's probably better to just drink water or tea, but I definitely wouldn't say you need to avoid them completely. This is just my personal opinion based on experience. I'd be glad to hear your differing opinions on this matter =).

Anyways, thanks again guys, keep up the good work.
