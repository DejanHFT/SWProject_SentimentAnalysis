What are some effective strategies against horse archers like mongols and paratians?,kingofthehill5,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7kt5sb/what_are_some_effective_strategies_against_horse/,843,3060,"I can't think of any formations that can defeat the archers particularly infantry. So what kind of infantry with what kind of weapons have the best chance at defeating the horse archers, and also makes me wonder if horse archers were the most effective type of army, everyone who used it were highly successful the mongols almost conquered the known world even though coming from a wasteland, the paratians defeated the mighty romans and the huns too.

Edit - thank you everyone for providing such an insightful answers, i learned a lot today. "
