What is your favorite movie of all time ?,FireFox9916,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/cjjh1k/what_is_your_favorite_movie_of_all_time/,121,19,Currently my favorite movies is Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. Even though I wouldn't consider it the best film of all time because you can't really critique art objectively and everyone has their own opinion. Also among other things I think the way Coppola shows the relationships is imperfect and flawed as there isn't really too much depth in them. I would love to hear your own favorite movies and if possible why they are your favorite movies. I hope I haven't made too many grammatical errors because English isn't my native language. First post here hope I am doing everything right.
