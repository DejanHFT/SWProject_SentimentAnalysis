Why did many expert musicians of the 50s and 60s dislike rock and roll?,coolnavigator,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/18dutp5/why_did_many_expert_musicians_of_the_50s_and_60s/,271,308,"I was watching [this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX5BCgmr7tg) about studio musicians in Los Angeles who were at the top of their field, producing music for almost every major band or talent in the region. One common theme was that these musicians were primarily in it for the money (and they did work extremely hard for it), and several of them even said that the music they played (largely rock) was not their favorite type of music. One guy called himself a jazz musician.

What was the early perception of rock music from a musician's perspective (ie, not from a reactionary ""it's satan's music"" perspective)?

Was it the simplicity? The lack of improvisation?

Was it less melody, more rhythm? Was it that melody was previously carried by an instrument, but rock and roll turned music into a vocal art, where melody was generally led by vocals (with the exception of occasional solos, which really didn't happen until decades later anyway)?

edited: added some additional suggestions inspired by comments

***Note: this is not a commentary on why pop culture liked or disliked rock when it was new. I'm asking about expert musicians and what it means for their craft.***"
