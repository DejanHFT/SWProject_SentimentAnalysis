My team and I have just released the first wellness-based planner on iTunes and would love for you to check it out. We wanted to make planning fitness goals visual and intuitive, so you can plan activities with icons. The icons are based of the five pillars of preventative health as recommended by the American College of Lifestyle Medicine: eat right, exercise, get enough sleep, spend time with friends and family, and decompress (i.e. meditation, yoga).
