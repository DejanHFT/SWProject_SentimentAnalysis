Civilization is the original cause of ecocide,janos-leite,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/jhebrg/civilization_is_the_original_cause_of_ecocide/,52,12,"I recently read a text called [It’s Not Capitalism that’s Driving Ecocide; it’s Civilization](https://macskamoksha.com/2019/12/not-capitalism), written by Kollibri terre Sonnenblume, and I decided to write something about it. I agree that it is not only capitalism that is driving ecocide and that colonialist society has been doing this since long before. By the title, some people may think that he is saying that capitalism is not a problem, which would be wrong since the text states that “capitalism cannot be reformed and must be dismantled”.

The central point of the text should be read as a question: is it possible to reconcile Marxism and environmentalism? Although eco-socialists guarantee it is, there are some complications to be solved, especially when considering concepts such as “human supremacy”, or anthropocentrism. And with that I am not saying that movements like Earth First are more coherent. I am not in a position to make this assessment.

The problem is that much of ecology and socialism is anthropocentric. Most ecologists and eco-socialists do not criticize civilization. Part of eco-anarchism understands this criticism because it has opened up to other ecological perspectives. The State also cannot be reformed and must be dismantled. The ecological crisis makes capitalism even more contradictory, but the civilizing contradiction has been present since the foundation of class society: the opposition between human beings and other beings.

The question is: how far can eco-socialism go in its critique of the human domain over nature? To reflect on this, we can start by thinking about the [words](https://www.correio24horas.com.br/noticia/nid/vida-sustentavel-e-vaidade-pessoal-diz-ailton-krenak/) of Ailton Krenak : “I put in question whether there is anything possible to think of as sustainable in the urban and modern way of life that we share in various places (…). What activity can be sustainable within such a system? ”

If civilization started ecocide long before capitalism, how can the end of capitalism itself put an end to ecocide? Is a socialist, ecological and sustainable civilization possible?

Continuing with Krenak’s reflection, “food production is certainly not sustainable”. The agricultural revolution (also called the Neolithic revolution) is considered a major advance in human history, as well as the green revolution (use of new technologies to increase agricultural production, starting in the 1960s). But both were disastrous for nature and human life. Biotechnology represents a next step in the same direction, while agroecology promises to reverse the devastating effects of these “revolutions”, turning agriculture into a sustainable practice.

But let us consider sustainability as a myth, or “as a narrative that was created by corporations to continue winning over consumers with the idea that what you are consuming is produced in a sustainable way, but it is a lie”. In this sense, how to know if agroecology is really sustainable?

Even with the most ecological agriculture in the world, it is possible that “the numbers don’t match”, as Krenak says. This is because the needs we have now do not correspond to the naturally sustainable needs for human beings. These are needs created by civilization, which would never be possible without a way of life based on patriarchy, exploitation, accumulation, expansion, invasion, slavery, genocide, epistemicide and ecocide. If in fact “the infrastructure that exists in cities is going to collapse” and “all the attempts in the world to regulate consumption, production, distribution of goods are unsustainable”, what to do?

Well, we know what not to do. We cannot continue to assume the same premises that it is enough to end the waste generated by capitalism, or invest in scientific and technological advances that aim at the common good (of humanity) instead of the profit of companies. This may still be insufficient. Technology gives us extraordinary powers. Can we use all these great powers produced by our techno-scientific “advancement” for the good of all species and the planet as a whole? Is this humanly possible? Is this possible without anthropocentrism or human exceptionalism?

It is necessary to understand that “we are making wrong choices”. Not just capitalists, but we have all been making the wrong choices for a long, long time. Can we assume all the responsibility that comes with the powers granted by technological development? Environmentalists in general do not criticize the technology or the urban way of life itself. On the contrary, they are talking about sustainable cities and green technology. But what if an urban and technological way of life is actually a “trap”, something inherently unsustainable?

Krenak’s proposal is a human society that leaves no trace of its passage through the land. “We leave too much trace and every culture that leaves a trace is unsustainable.” The heart of this idea, for me, goes unnoticed by most people: that we are only passing through here. Not only us as individuals, but humanity as a whole is only here temporarily. That is, humanity needs to have an end. Civilization is, in many ways, the denial of an end. Our culture didn’t lose it’s way, it didn’t become unsustainable due to change in it’s course. It has been unsustainable since the beginning.

We are alienated “in relation to the origin of everything we eat, drink, wear”. But we are also alienated in relation to disposal, that is, the final destination of everything we eat, drink, dress, and even our own final destination. Our way of life, our consumption and our very existence has become unsustainable. That is why trying to be individually “more sustainable” is a “personal vanity”. We won’t change anything if we don’t change everything.

The idea that you can save the planet by doing your part creates “a psychological environment that hides the real reason” of the ecological crisis. The way we are living, in a more fundamental sense than just the economic system, is the cause of the ecological crisis. But we are led to believe that there is no other way to live, since we are in the most “advanced” way, and since we cannot “go back” or “revert time”.

There are other ways to live, but as Krenak says, some of them are “racist and elitist, they suggest that the rich are the ones who know how to live in the world”. This phrase can be reinterpreted in several ways: they suggest that whites are the ones who know how to live in the world. Or the people who created the industrial revolution. Or the people who have created empires. They are the people who created a way of life based on the intensive use of animals and soil. You see? Civilization invented class and poverty.

Can we prevent industrial processes from draining our water? In other words, can we prevent civilization from destroying the world? To cite one of the most difficult problems: how to abandon the use of fossil fuel? As Krenak says, “fossil fuel should have been abandoned in the 1990s”. We knew we had to stop, but we didn’t. Why is it going to be different now?

The hope for a sustainable civilization holds a belief, a modern mythology, which is the “idea of ​​self-sufficiency” of humanity. We believe that everything is possible if we strive. A better system is enough. “With the advancement of what has been called civilization, and with the advent of globalization, this thinking has taken over the entire planet,” says Krenak. Civilization has always tried to be sustainable, and it has always failed to do so. I repeat: why would it be different in a post-capitalist civilization?

The urban experience took us away from nature. The simplicity of this phrase is misleading. Being away from nature is not just not knowing how to live without a refrigerator and a stove. It means, first of all, not remembering WHO you are and what you are doing HERE. “Many values ​​that we have, that we think are fundamental to humanity, have been created and have been instilled in our culture, in our mentality”. They are not values ​​of humanity, they are values ​​of a culture that denies humanity, because it denies nature. Just as it denies life, because it denies death.

This “memory loss” is a central concept. When the poet says “people are not bad, they are just lost”, he reflects an ancestral idea. When someone happened to do something wrong, the other members of the community would come together to REMEMBER that person of the good things they did, that is, make them remember WHO THEY ARE.

Thus, the central question for criticizing ecocide is not: “how to be sustainable”, but “who are we?”, or even, “what is the human being?”. It doesn’t seem like a very pragmatic question, you can protest that we need more action and less philosophy. However, adherence to this silent and unquestioned philosophy of civilization is what brought us to this nightmare.

That is why I consider it so important that Krenak decides to talk about “worldview”, and more specifically, the worldview that “the Earth is a living organism”. This should not be interpreted as a metaphor. It is not about treating the Earth “as if” it were a living organism. If the Earth is really a living organism, everything that civilization has understood about the world is wrong, because all civilized knowledge is based on the objectification of the natural world.

Global warming is just Earth’s fever. It is not the disease itself, but a symptom. Traditional environmentalists focus on treating the symptom, but how to treat the disease? How to diagnose the disease?

The human being is able to survive if left naked in the forest, but is not capable of causing much damage to the environment. To destroy its habitat, it is necessary to create special tools and techniques for this, which have nothing to do with the need for survival. The cultures that did not create these devices “are not engaged in planetary consumption”. If these peoples are the “medicine”, in Krenak’s words, who or what is the disease? As he says, “there are people left outside this civilizing circle who still know, still reflect on a worldview, are protected by this memory and are still capable of thinking other worlds and building other world perspectives”. This suggests that we, civilized, like those who have forgotten who they are, are stuck in a single way of thinking and building the world. Our vision is restricted. The weight of the technical system that we created to change the world as we see fit can be impossible to carry, unsustainable in a deeper sense of the word.

Civilizing techno-culture “is fascinating”, but also “a poison”. “Everyone becomes dependent on this great embrace of the world for apparent human needs.” It is an addiction, as Kollibri also says. Now imagine how difficult it is to get rid of a collective addiction that has dominated us for thousands of years… Of course it seems utopian. But at the same time, nothing could be more unrealistic than staying in that addiction. As it should be clear, the greatest damage of this addiction is not exactly to the Earth, but to the human spirit. In the same way, he who weighs heavily on the life of his own family does more damage to his own self-esteem than to his family.

We have not been able to remove this burden from our conscience. We are experiencing a “dissociation” between human experience and the planet. However, we do not destroy the world without knowing what we are doing. We use all our intelligence in this project. Necrocivilization, to make a parallel with necrocapitalism, placed us in a simulated world, in which we like to be. It makes us pretend that everything is going to be okay, when it obviously isn’t. Obviously the damage we do to the world cannot be simply erased. Like a lie that has been kept at all costs, the consequences of admitting the truth are now necessarily disastrous for us.

“We were converted to an idea of ​​humanity that is not real. It is a post-humanity ”, says Krenak. The humanity that we try to realize cannot come true. The attempt to realize this ideal, running over others, is the civilizing process, “it is the core of colonial thought”. The concepts of civilization and humanity that we use are impregnated with coloniality. “Colonialism says: let’s modernize, let’s civilize, let’s humanize”. The way out is not to colonize other planets, but to know yourself.

How far have traditional critics of capitalism dared to go on the journey “into ourselves”? How much have you questioned what has been considered humanly necessary, and how much have you simply accepted the civilized historical process as if it told the story of mankind?

The heart of the criticism of anthropocentrism can be summed up in the following sentence by Krenak: “The problem is when we think that we are the only life here, to the point that, when the basis for this continuity here is not enough, we will reproduce elsewhere”. This leads me again to the denial of the limit, the inevitable end of life. Everything that begins has an end. But the anthropocentric concept of sustainability does not see an end for humanity. Even when the ecological perspective considers itself ecocentric or biocentric, it does not think about human existence within a cycle with a beginning, middle and end. It wants to bargain for the continuity of the scheme.

New minds, on the other hand, no longer want the scheme to continue. “This is what boys and girls are doing, they are telling the world that adults falsify a narrative about the world, and they don’t want to.” Mild autists have an advantage in realizing this. As a friend recently made me think, civilization created an exclusive language to think the world, a neurotypical or “normal” language, which excludes the natural diversity of ways of thinking, because this diversity is not efficient for the production of a civilizing project. It is common for people with neuroatypical mental structures to have difficulty understanding social and communication rules, as they do not seem to make any sense. We are forced to repress a part of ourselves in order to become “functional”, and this usually comes with a feeling of acting like a robot. In a way, it is exactly how anyone feels in civilization, in some degree. This only goes unnoticed when their performance is more easily accepted by society. “Normal” minds forget what it is like to think outside the box that civilization puts us, but “different” minds cannot forget, because they are terrible actors.

That is why tolerance or living with the different is not enough. An “alternation” is needed. Alternation implies knowing how to pass the ball, and also knowing when to leave, rest, stop, give up. Come back later, who knows. The majority of men who feel threatened by feminism have difficulty precisely in this point: they do not know how to lose. They believe that all the weight of a ancient oppressive structure can be dissipated with a policy of women “participation” in the same schemes that the patriarchy created, without displacing or disturbing them in any way. In other words, they believe in the “continuity of the scheme”. As if things need not to weigh for men. This would only be possible if patriarchy had not produced privileges. It is never easy to lose privileges and comforts, but sometimes it is necessary.

This should not be read as an apology for catastrophism or paralyzing pessimism, or worse, a connivance with a system of discarding people. But it’s hard not to look like a sadist when you have bad news to give. I do not intent to “tell the truth and run”. I intent to help whoever is receiving the message to be able to bear it. It takes courage to give up certain addictions. But perhaps what is holding us is of a different nature, something much more difficult to abandon.

I return to the main question here: are environmentalists willing to lose in the name of alternating with the Other? Judging by the mainstream ecological discourse, the answer would be no. I could cite an example: “I do not agree that more progress will be made by appealing to people’s hearts than to their wallets,” says ecological economist Robert Constanza, founder of the International Society for Ecological Economics, the main reference in ecological economics. It seems too romantic to say that it is precisely the heart, and not the reason, that can save us now. If it is true that human action always seeks comparative advantage, the worldview presented here has no chance. However, if it makes any sense, the economy as a whole needs to be questioned, not just the liberal economy, but our whole self-image as “rational beings”.

Eco-capitalism wants to put a price on nature in order to protect it. Eco-socialism wants collective ownership of the means of production (as a final objective) and more effective state regulation of the economy (as a more immediate objective) to protect nature. As Kollibri suggests, eco-capitalism is much easier to refute. Eco-socialism, however, is much more complex to answer. This is because, although it can be properly ecological, it is not exactly “sustainable”. How so?

The answer, for me, begins in this speech by Krenak: “In some cultures, the idea of ​​falling is within the cycle of existence. It articulates with the idea of ​​the seed, which buries itself, dies and becomes the tree and gives more seed, and fruit, and becomes seed, and buries again. Cycles”. Our Judeo-Christian culture, however, sees the fall as a problem. We do not want to fall, we are special, we are destined for a special place, where no one else dies and no one else falls. And because we don’t want to fall, we can’t be really sustainable, because we deny alternation. The life cycle includes death. We do not want the end of civilization, we want to avoid the collapse of this economic model based on cities that contemplate eternity. We want to use the techniques, knowledge, science and technology created in and for civilization to prevent the fall and build a supposedly advanced, and supposedly human, world. Instead, we should accept the consequences of an immeasurable accumulation of wrong decisions. Decisions so wrong that they can no longer be corrected. We need to learn to drop and fall. Can we do it, or is civilized power too tempting?"
