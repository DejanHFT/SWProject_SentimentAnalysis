Birthday present for my father -- some delicious sauces for cooking,stopeats,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/186dv3g/birthday_present_for_my_father_some_delicious/,4,2,"My mother recently died, and as she did most of the cooking, my father is still learning how to manage by himself. He's mentioned a few times that he loves the various sauces that Hellofresh provides, so I was thinking of getting him a present of a six-pack of various sauces, ideally with relatively low sugar content.

Does anyone have recommendations for sauces that you can put on a variety of meats and vegetables to make a quick dinner? Ideally not so big so if he doesn't like one, it doesn't live in the fridge forever. "
