"If John Steinbeck had a literary successor, who would it be?",YourLovelyMan,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jk1tea/if_john_steinbeck_had_a_literary_successor_who/,480,1926,"Itâ€™s been said that Cormac McCarthy is the literary successor to William Faulkner, as both wrote dark, southern gothic fiction in a stream of consciousness style, McCarthy a generation after Faulkner.

If Steinbeck had a successor, someone who came a generation later and wrote about tragedy, loss, and the struggle and will to survive in Monterey County or thereabouts, who do you think it would be?"
