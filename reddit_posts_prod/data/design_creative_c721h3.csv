Creative Cloud alternatives?,braith_rose,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/c721h3/creative_cloud_alternatives/,6,0,"Hello All,

Thank you for your time, and hope your day goes well. Is anyone frustrated with the pricing of Adobe apps? Same discussion, different day. I doubt there are any decent ways to rip the programs now, have not found any ways of obtaining a free subscription. If you don't have a way, how have you stayed relevant and boycotted the programs? What are your tricks for avoiding the costs?

Thanks,
