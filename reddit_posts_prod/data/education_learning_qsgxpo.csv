Proficiency Based Learning - any other middle schools doing this?,VTMomof2,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/qsgxpo/proficiency_based_learning_any_other_middle/,11,1,"I'll admit I came from a very traditional high school and graduated 20+ years ago. I dont get the things they do in school these days - reading whatever book you want? Back when I was in school the whole class read the same book (usually a classic that wasnt an easy/interesting read for a teen) and you were TESTED on it to make sure you read it. (had to write an essay or whatever). Now it seems like kids are reading easy books and getting to pick whatever book they want. How can teachers even be sure they read the book if they can pick from an infinite number of books? Or another surprising thing is that they are allowed to retake tests and quizzes until they get a grade they are happy with? I sort of get this a little because you learn what you did wrong (say in math) and get to retry it. But still...whatever happened to just studying before hand?

So my 8th grader's school has moved to Proficiency Based Learning this year. Gone are As, Bs, Cs, Ds, etc...and now they get ""Beginning"", ""Developing"", ""Achieving"",  or ""Extending"". I just dont understand the point of this. How is this getting them ready for high school where they will get As, Bs, Cs, etc...?? My son is now only interested in doing his best work if its a graded assignment. For homework they hardly have it first of all, 2nd of all you could get every answer wrong and get the same grade as a kid getting every answer right. They just want you to ""try"". I have a smart kid but he just doesnt even care this year because none of the assignments even matter. 

I'd love to be enlightened about how this type of grading is a good thing, because to me it just seems like a reason to let kids slack off. I'm hesitant to complain about it since I dont really understand the point of moving to this system - it seems like a way to get the kids who werent doing good in school to look better, and the kids who were doing good before to stay the same.

Sorry for the rant!"
