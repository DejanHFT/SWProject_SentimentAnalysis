"A Microsoft employee thinks there may soon be huge deflation in medical costs, as the company is close to commoditizing doctor's expertise & making it cheap and freely available.",lughnasadh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/15quaie/a_microsoft_employee_thinks_there_may_soon_be/,472,2112,"[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/15pskoo/i_had_a_several_hour_conversation_with_the/) in r/singularity is very interesting, and is an account of a conversation with a Microsoft employee working on their AI development.

The pertinent bit I'm referring to is - *""He claimed that they were working with the technology from their Nuance (the company) acquisition to develop tools to assist in healthcare diagnosis and automation, and that they had gotten frequency of the model hallucinating down to 1-0.5% of the time, and that remaining major obstacles have to due with liability.*

*If/when they release versions of it for use, they say it will be important to have professionals actually handling the use of the suggested diagnoses and medications to remove the possibility of lawsuits, and while a future bigger role is possible they would need to be backed by medical insurance companies who would only insure them when their risk of malpractice is below that of doctors. Despite the resistance and difficulty, they do think that healthcare will be a major field for so to revolutionize especially because “the US medical system is a big legal cartel, that makes healthcare cheap elsewhere by gouging their R&D costs at home,” and the opportunity to disrupt and streamline that market has big possibilities for innovation and profit especially because “90% of their job is automatable according to doctors I’ve talked to,” and resolving rampant administrative bloat with AI may save billions of dollars in burden on patients.""*"
