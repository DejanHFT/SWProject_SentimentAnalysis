What is your favorite literary junk food?,Burngis12,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2uo12e/what_is_your_favorite_literary_junk_food/,99,32,"Like a bag of chips or a box of doughnuts, some books have little to no real meaning or depth. They won't make you a better person either but they are just irresistible. And maybe a person or two would furrow their brows at you or look at you with an ""Is he really reading that?"" look if you were to read it in public. But you don't care. It's fun. 

For me right now it's the Star Wars books. Currently reading Shadows of the Empire and I'm having a blast.

What's your literary junk food, /r/books?"
