My wife has continued to be unhappy at her new job.  I’ve tried my best to tell her to look at the positives, and try to focus on things that make her happy outside of work, but it’s not going anywhere. In the interim, she reached out to her old supervisor to catch up and inquire about doing some part time freelance work for them. In these conversations, her old boss shared with her that her old org has had some major changes in management (including ousting the CEO), and they recently received a large donation.   


With this information, DW is seriously considering leaving her current job for the old one. To be fair, I’m starting to come around to the idea of her looking for another job because I see how unhappy she is, although I’m not thrilled of the idea of giving up the long term benefits/job security that come with her current role. However, I’m dead set against her going back to her old job. I saw how miserable she was there, and while she says now that “maybe it wasn’t so bad in comparasion to my job now,” I just have this terrible feeling that in a month or two, and the bad things about this old job will rear their ugly head. Also, and I hate to say it, I feel that she’s being a tad immature, espicially when you consider the benefits she’d be giving up at the govt job. If she was 24 I’d say “yeah, go back to the old job, and if your job gets cut in a year or two, we’ll manage,” but that’s not the case; we’re in our 30s, have a mortgage and are looking at getting pregnant  likely sometime this year. It’s frustrating that she can’t seem to see the bigger picture through her day to day unhappiness. 

Anyways, we sat down last night, and I said, ""I'm not against you looking elsewhere, because you're so unhappy at this job, but I strongly feel that going back to \[old job\] isn't a good idea. You were just as unhappy there as you are here, and I saw for five years how that unhappiness affected you both in and out of work, and I don't want you to go through that again. Ultimately, it's your decision, and whatever you decide, I'll stand by you, but just know this is how I feel.""

Well, that didn't go over very well with her. She claimed that I haven't been taking her feeling seriously, and that I'm just brushing them off by saying, ""oh well, just find something fun to do outside of work."" I told her this isn't true, and that because I *do* care about her feelings, I'm voicing my concerns about het going back to her old job, where she was in tears on a weekly basis due to her unhappiness, and I don't want to go back to a job that, as few as two months ago, made her unhappy. She then continued with, ""how do I know that I won't go to a different job, and I'll be unhappy there?"" I responded, ""how do you know you won't?"" It went back and forth, and eventually she said, ""going back to \[old job\] is really going to be the only thing that makes me happy, and if you don't support that, you don't love and care about me.""  She stormed off, and we haven't spoken since.

I'm just at a total loss over this. I know how unhappy she is in her current job, and I want her to be happy more than anything, but she seems so fixated on going back to her old job, that also made her miserable, so I'm not sure what I should do here.

TL;DR Wife wants to go back to old job that made her unhappy. I voiced my concerns about that, and she got upset."
