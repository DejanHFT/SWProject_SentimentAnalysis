What's the most heroic scene in cinema?,borislugosi,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/94iihb/whats_the_most_heroic_scene_in_cinema/,485,286,"The first scene that pops into my mind is (spoilers) When Sam carries Frodo up the remainder of Mount Doom. The big ""But I can carry you!"" moment from Return of the King. So much emotion, so much heroism and true friendship.

But, there must be many others, and not just action based. It could just be a depiction of a heroic decision. And of course, male or female! 

What do you think?"
