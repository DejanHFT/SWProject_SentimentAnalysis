How well can running help with toning?,duskyslayer,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9ca0eo/how_well_can_running_help_with_toning/,8,0,"Hellos, im a teen who's father is focing todo cross country for the 3rd straight year. I really dreaded it and would not stop arguing with my dad but half of me was actually okay with it because it could potentially help me with mt body goals. The other two years i ran cross country, i was a long stick. I had no muscle and i had sortof a flat belly.this year however, i have a really flat stomach(but no abs) and am less of a stick and also plan to eat correctly(currently understanding the correct amount of calories to eat; tdee). Im asking how well it can help me because the other years, i came into it expecting a good change to my body if i took my shirt off but it didnt really change exept for a small slim."
