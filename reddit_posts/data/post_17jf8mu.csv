Explanation for physical reaction to certain noises?,Educational-Pay-284,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/17jf8mu/explanation_for_physical_reaction_to_certain/,67,210,"Like the classic intolerance to nails on a chalkboard, mine is squeaky rubber. Like wet shoes on a tile floor, balloon animals being made, and absolutely worst of all, my toddler chewing on his pacifier. 

It is excruciating. It causes a horrible physical sensation in my ears, teeth, and brain. Like being electrocuted, vibrating, and kinda tickles in a horrible way. Itâ€™s intense and comes in waves for at least a minute after the sound stops. 

Anyone else experience this or know why this happens??"
