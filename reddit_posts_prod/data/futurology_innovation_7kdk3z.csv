Scientists don’t get the credit they deserve in modern society,cosmusedelic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7kdk3z/scientists_dont_get_the_credit_they_deserve_in/,335,4688,"Throughout human history we have had the innovations that have furthered us as a species. This has been occurring since the days of the Neandrethals; first discovery of fire, discovery of the wheel, formulation of language, the first tool etc. It is intrinsic to our nature to be scientists. Before we even knew how to communicate with each other we knew how to be primitive “scientists” and use our curiosity to make discoveries. Thinking about it I realized that our nature of curiosity is what has molded the course of humanity. Everything around us has been advanced through innovation and technology. Making discoveries about how the world around us operates is not something that should be forgotten about in modern era. It seems as if people have forgotten how to be curious. Distracted by the society we live in today, we are bombarded with more information than ever before. 

We are now approached with more questions than ever about how far humanity can go. Our knowledge of the universe is only just beginning to be understood and is approached by more questions than we have answers. We still have no understanding of how the universe is expanding faster as time goes on or what 95% of the universe’s composition(dark matter and energy) is, just to name a couple. We are only beginning to understand the quantum laws of physics and the rules that dictate subatomic particles. We still have minimal understanding of time beyond Einstein’s general relativity. 

We are on the cusp of an evolution of human understanding. Technology is taking us to places never thought to have been possibly conceived. A computer-brain merge could be a reality in the very soon future. Think of how far we have come and how lucky we are to be alive in the most exciting time in human history. Thank you to the scientists and future scientists who keep the wheels of human evolution spinning.
