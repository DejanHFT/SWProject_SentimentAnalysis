Which historical event (battle / war) which was recorded and believed by most people to be a victory was in fact misrepresented ?,redsteal1,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3i0jm0/which_historical_event_battle_war_which_was/,654,710,"IMHO until the digital age and instantaneous news, history was for the most part written by the victors: For example, Ramesses II (the Great) and the battle of Kadesh. From the Egyptian side depicted as a great victory. However, from the Hittites side it was at best a draw.

Edit: Thanks people , I have some new reading and listening to do !

Edit 2: 1812 American / British / Canadian conflict, thanks to all those that mentioned this , from one side or the other. As is stated in Wikipedia this 'war' is largely overlooked by the British. I have to agree because before today I never even gave it a thought. That is not to demean the other contributions but this is something I will spend some time looking at! "
