Are there any residential scale carbon capture technologies available?,wdapp89,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/uxm09j/are_there_any_residential_scale_carbon_capture/,32,16,I’m considering adding an non-grid tie solar system to my home.  As solar is somewhat variable in energy production the system would need to be sized for poor production times of year/days.  Are there any electrically based carbon capture technologies that could be run with excess electricity production?  I’ve seen some diy solutions but by the time I’ve purchased and had shipped the needed chemicals then disposed of them I’ll have spent all the carbon I would have captured.
