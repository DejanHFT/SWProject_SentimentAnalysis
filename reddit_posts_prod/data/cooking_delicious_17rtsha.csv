any delicious alternative whole turkey recipes?,NigerianPrinceClub,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/17rtsha/any_delicious_alternative_whole_turkey_recipes/,7,0,"i'm going to be given a turkey this year but i'm tired of baking turkey. Not only is it a lot of work, but no one ever eats the leftovers the following days lol. 

Are there alternative dishes where i can perhaps cut up an entire turkey and stew it? or pan fry the cut up pieces? no deep frying please. thx"
