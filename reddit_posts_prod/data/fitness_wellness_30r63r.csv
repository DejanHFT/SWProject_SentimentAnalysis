Eating well in Japan.,JSmithWriter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/30r63r/eating_well_in_japan/,9,1,"Hey guys,

I'm in Japan right now. Unfortunately, I can't read kanji very well, so I have no clue about the ingredients in most of the food. I'll be here for another month and a half, and I'm trying to eat a bit healthier and less fatty than I have been so far, focusing on high protein. Does anyone have any specific food recommendations? I'd appreciate it!"
