"If it were made accurately, what is one historical TV series you would like to watch?",Elissa_of_Carthage,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6y0zim/if_it_were_made_accurately_what_is_one_historical/,3583,11346,"I'd love to watch a TV series based on the Romanovs, how they came to power and how they fell from Michael I to Nicholas II. I think it would be very interesting to see it developing through the centuries. If it were like the Crown in quality, and we had one season per monarch, I would watch the hell out of it.

EDIT: Wow, RIP my inbox. Thanks for your answers guys!

EDIT 2: This blew up. Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!"
