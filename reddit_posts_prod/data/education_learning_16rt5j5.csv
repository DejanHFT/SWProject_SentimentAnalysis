9-year-old boy wants to learn guitar/Ukulele,acriticalpanda,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/16rt5j5/9yearold_boy_wants_to_learn_guitarukulele/,11,0,"My 9-year-old son wants to learn the guitar, so I decided to buy him a Ukulele as a starting point. I thought the small size of the Ukulele would be easier for him to handle, and he can transition to the guitar later if he wants to. The only issue is that neither of us knows how to play any instrument. My son doesn't have much music knowledge, except that he enjoys singing. I’m not an expert but I feel he’s not gifted in music and his pitch might not be very accurate. I'm planning to visit a musical instrument store to inquire about Ukulele teachers. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
