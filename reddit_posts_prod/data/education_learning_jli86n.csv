The Myth of Learning Styles,rmurphe,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/jli86n/the_myth_of_learning_styles/,94,156,"I’ve been toying with the idea of trying to make a series of videos that are based on rigorously peer reviewed research in education.  I’d like to try to get this information out more broadly to the teaching community.  I feel like so much misinformation is out there but there is never any talk about what has been proven to really work and how we can use it in teaching.  

This is my first try.  Future ideas include memory and how understanding its mechanism in the brain can help us in the classroom.  The misconception of engagement equals learning.  Retrieval practice and the testing effect.  The problem with growth mindset and its application into the classroom and more.  I’m open to ideas too.  

Here is the link to  The Myth of Learning Styles.  I already know do a few mistakes but still happy with what I have so far.  More feedback is appreciated.  

I hope this content can be help inform, enlighten, and engage.
