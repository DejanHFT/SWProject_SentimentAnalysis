How do I achieve a 500 calorie deficit?,srad_,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/27uqz8/how_do_i_achieve_a_500_calorie_deficit/,15,0,"I am in my first week of serious training after taking a long time off the routine.

I am looking to cut, i am currently creating a meal plan and following the workout routine linked below.

http://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/20-6-day-weight-cardio-cutting-workout.html

I've started to use my fitness pal to count calories and as you can see the routine i linked calls for 500 calorie deficit.

My meal plan looks like this: http://imgur.com/jUnwhdR

At approximately 1400 calories a day, i need to burn 1900-2000 calories a day.

It says to burn that many calories, i need to jog (5mph, 12 min mile) for 200 minutes (3h20m)

That seems extremely excessive - when I can barely run for 1/2 at that pace.

Will I keep gaining weight? How can I burn more calories without spending so much time on a treadmill?

I should mention that I am a 21 y/o male, also taking hydroxycut and BCAA at this time, my cardio is not great as I used to smoke.

Any help/tips would be greatly appreciated..
