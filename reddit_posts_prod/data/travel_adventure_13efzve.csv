Help me plan a last-minute solo adventure!,Present_Ebb_9569,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/13efzve/help_me_plan_a_lastminute_solo_adventure/,8,3,"Hey Reddit, I'm a woman in my early 30s who loves hiking, trying amazing food, and checking out historical sites. I have a 3.5 week window (including travel time) starting in mid-June and I'm looking to plan a last-minute trip flying out from the US West Coast. I'm hoping to find a destination that's safe and easy to meet other solo travelers while also allowing me to fully immerse myself in the experience. I don't have a strict budget (thinking maybe 1-10k?) as flights are already pricey during high season. Any suggestions for a great adventure? For reference, I've traveled in the Americas and Northern Europe before.

I've been considering a few options so far:

* Portugal (including Azores, Madeira)
* A section of El Camino de Santiago
* Tanzania (Safari / Zanzibar)

Would love to hear your suggestions and experiences if you've been to any of these places or have other recommendations!"
