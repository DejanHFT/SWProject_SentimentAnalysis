How communication technologies have progressed?,alexefi,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3gosv2/how_communication_technologies_have_progressed/,10,14,"I remember when i was a kid(1995 i believe)  in Russia, Moscow, my dad went to business trip to Houston, TX. He called me from there via land line. And i clearly remember there was roughly 5 sec delay after i stop talking and he start talking. Which i contributed for time to signal get from Moscow to Houston and back. Now I skype with my friends in Moscow, myself being in Toronto, ON and there no delay at all. I stop asking question they start answering right away. What has changed?"
