I miss Bugs Bunny cartoons playing before Warner Brothers movies at the cinema,captainbluebear25,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/s3ric5/i_miss_bugs_bunny_cartoons_playing_before_warner/,464,3623,"Does anybody else remember classic Bugs Bunny (or Merrie Melodies) cartoons playing before Warner Brothers movies in the cinema? I just remembered it all of a sudden and I haven't seen it happen in years. I remember loving it, like a little cherry before the ice-cream. I'm not sure why they stopped, I couldn't find anything when googling.

Edit: seems the consensus is ""OP is old and starting to lose it"" but a few great clues have emerged! Seems it was not just a WB thing. It ended in most markets in the 60s or 70s, but for some reason lingered in Australia and New Zealand. I remember seeing them here in the 90s. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_of_American_animation"
