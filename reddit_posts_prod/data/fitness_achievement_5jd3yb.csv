"Diet and training, will I achieve my goal?",DanSamillo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5jd3yb/diet_and_training_will_i_achieve_my_goal/,10,0,"I've been lifting for about 2-3 years (Fucked around diet wise for a good portion of it) I started about about 252 and got down to about 150. Now back at 170~. 

I'm trying to get back down to the weight I was at before, last time I did it through circuit training and general running/cardio. But I want to keep what muscle mass I have ideally not losing much, but also want to do it as fast as possible. My training at the minute conists of 3, 60 minute runs a week, following by a 5x5 routine I found on here. 

The ""problem"" is my diet, I can't sustain a diet of chicken and rice for very long as I seem to get bored quite fast, but after losing all of the weight I kind of know what I need to eat to lose the weight, it's more keeping the muscle mass I have. On average I'd say I probably have about 60g protein a day, when I should be having 140-160 and around 1900 calories (TDEE - 500 recommends 2300, which seemed a bit high). 

So basically I've got a few questions;

Will not getting high levels of protein affect me that much in the long term if I'm not eating at a surplus since from my understanding I won't gain mass anyway?

Does anyone have a list of recipes that I can cook and take to work, which taste nice and can be cooked in bulk to take to work?

I'm not sure if it's ""broscience"" but I've read that running is bad for muscle mass as it eats at it and LISS is a better way to do my cardio, is this true? Averaging 8km runs 3 times a week, with a 2-4km run after every 5x5 session.

Sorry if this is a little hard to understand, I tried to keep it as simple as possible, any question or recommendations are greatly appreciated! "
