[Request] weirdest tasty food combo,rckrusekontrol,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/5zgr42/request_weirdest_tasty_food_combo/,15,2,"[Request/discussion]
I'm interested in what are the strangest two foods you've mixed- successfully. What sounds disgusting but you tried it for some reason and you found it actually delicious? Of course, taste is subjective, so no harping on people if you think their combo is too gross. 
For example (I tried this when I was a kid, from an episode of "" Doug""): pepperoni and banana. For some reason I liked it and kept wrapping pepperoni around bananas and eating them for a week.
What is the strangest thing you ever concocted that you thoroughly enjoyed?
