Shiplap help - how to shiplap around corner that is not square.,armedwaffles,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/158poyw,9,2,"I live in a house built in the 70s, some of the walls are a bit curve/ warped, it’s not square.

I’m trying to shiplap around the corners of the wall with 45 degree miter cuts. I’ve done it successfully for one corner already - see third picture for reference of what I’m trying to achieve. 

The wall corner is not perfectly square, how do I got about lining up the shiplap so that the outer corner of the shiplap is square and the edges line up? 

Was thinking about adding some wood shims or mudding the wall so it’s even? I’m a beginner DIYer - any advice is appreciated!"
