Moba + Strategy game idea,Prestiyoo_,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/x7h7fb/moba_strategy_game_idea/,7,1,"Hi,

Together with my friend we're in process of designing a new video game which would be a hybrid of moba and sort of tower defense\Rts. 

Players will have a choice to play a Champion (micro scale - like in moba. Multiple players in each team) or a Lord (macro scale - organizing settlements around the map, creating and managing troops which will be roaming around the places, economy, single player / team). So each team will consist of Lord and his Champions. 

It will be all about clash between the teams on different maps, where teams need to acquire neutral settlements (and other places to be captured) obtain resources, boost troops (in case of Lord) & improve items (in case of Champions) to defeat opponent team. 

We know that it is crucial to create as many mechanics as possible to keep the cooperation between champs and lord going on for the entire lenght of match. We have also came up with few ideas how to enchance the game experience and make the game feel like it has to offer something new, but i would like to avoid describing everything here. 

For the moment we're trying to simulate as many of our ideas as we can, noting down all the brainstorming results etc. 

Maybe you have any ideas or opinions on what i have shared with you. Ie. Do you think such gametype will be interesting? I would be grateful for your comments.

Thanks!"
