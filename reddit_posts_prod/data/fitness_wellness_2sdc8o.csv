Any health benefit to using the sauna after a workout?,Badgers1111,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2sdc8o/any_health_benefit_to_using_the_sauna_after_a/,65,72,"I lately have been going into the sauna for 5-10 minutes after my workout. I have heard conflicting reports on whether there are actually any health benefits from doing so. Does anyone else do this after a workout, if so why? Is it just to cool down or is there an actual health/wellness benefit? "
