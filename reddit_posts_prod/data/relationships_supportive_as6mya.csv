My parents arenâ€™t being supportive of my engagement,Bad_decisions08,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/as6mya/my_parents_arent_being_supportive_of_my_engagement/,5,1,"So my boyfriend[25m] and I[24f] have been together for a couple of years now and the other day he proposed ðŸ˜Š my parents lackluster reaction has been getting to me considering literally everyone else has been happy for us.

When I told my mom, she just looked at the ring and told me to show my dad and nothing else was said about it and itâ€™s been a few days. When I told my dad, he just asked me if I told my boyfriend that I wasnâ€™t ready to get married yet and that he needed to be established. My boyfriend doesnâ€™t have his own place but we wanted to get one together and I wasnâ€™t ready to move in until we were engaged so now we are looking at places.

Another thing, Iâ€™m still living at home until I finish school and my mom has said that I canâ€™t leave home until I get married but my fiancÃ©e and I are looking to live together soon and get married next year. I know that this is gonna be another argument but Iâ€™m ready to move out. Iâ€™m just scared that I will be cut off if I do move out before then and then thereâ€™s the fact that my dad is kind of verbally abusive so Iâ€™m worried about dealing with that until I move out.

Basically I need help on how to move forward with this. Feel free to ask any questions.

Tl:dr My parents arenâ€™t supportive of my engagement and donâ€™t want me to move out until I get married so Iâ€™m stuck between a rock and a hard place."
