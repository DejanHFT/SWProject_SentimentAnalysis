Examples of historical figures directing conversation towards a modern audience?,LettuceEnjoyABle,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/m1dihk/examples_of_historical_figures_directing/,87,707,"I was reading the [Dark Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages_(historiography)#Petrarch) wikipedia page, and discovered the following passage, in which Petrarch writes to future readers about the dark ages,

""My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms. But for you perhaps, if as I hope and wish you will live long after me, there will follow a better age. This sleep of forgetfulness will not last forever. When the darkness has been dispersed, our descendants can come again in the former pure radiance.""

It felt really cool to realize that he was directing his conversation to me, essentially, a future reader.  Are there other examples of this throughout history?"
