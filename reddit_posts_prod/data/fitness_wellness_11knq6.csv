I am not recovering well at all. Any suggestions for improvement? Thanks. ,SpankmasterS,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/11knq6/i_am_not_recovering_well_at_all_any_suggestions/,43,14,"Im guessing its age (nearing 40), but my recovery is just not happening. A few details:

Program, volume and progress benchmarks are not aggressive. 

Diet: Caloric surplus and macros is line. Micros indicate no major deficiency. Primarily meat, eggs, milk, cheese, veg. Carbs<30% of daily (mostly from oats and veg)

Supplements (daily): Creatine (5g), Fish oil (3000EPA + 1500DHA), Vit D (5000), Super B complex, Niacin, Now Multi, Psyllium, protein powder. 

Sleep: More then ever and quality is better. Napping has been added. 

I take a week off every 8 weeks. If I feel beat I''l drop to about 60% across the board for a week every so often as well. 

Medically cleared (recent physical). Bloodwork indicates hormones and all else is good. BP a touch high systolically..attibuted to pot of espresso. 

Ibuprofen as needed. 

I think this is it. Anything else I can do? I've been under stress...but thats been going on for a while and will not decrease anytime in the near future. 

Thanks ."
