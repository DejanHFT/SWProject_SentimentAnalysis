What chance of survival did first line of besiegers had in medieval era?,diploms1,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5x4697/what_chance_of_survival_did_first_line_of/,83,692,"Did the attackers in sieges had any chance of somehow surviving with their lives or they 100% knew they will die? I'm talking about he footmen who climbed ladders to attack the castle walls. The defenders could push down the ladders, throw rocks on them, throw hot oil on them, push them down, shoot them with arrows and finish off from up close.
I couldn't find anything on this topic on the internets, so decided to ask here. Hope it's a correct question for this reddit page :)"
