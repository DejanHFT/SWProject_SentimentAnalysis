How to build well-rounded athleticism?,poweroflegend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5vdhg3/how_to_build_wellrounded_athleticism/,15,0,"Current stats: 38 y/o, 5'9"", 205lbs, 30%-ish fat, pretty much sedentary until the beginning of December.

So I've got my diet in shape, I've been doing GSLP, walking a lot with my dog, taking the stairs to my cube on the 5th floor, and hiking for a few hours on weekends.  I'm down 25lbs and a few belt notches since the beginning of December, but lately I've been struggling with motivation/discipline to go to bed on time and then to get up in the morning and get to the gym before work.  I just found American Ninja Warrior on Hulu this weekend and it led to a bit of a eureka moment - I think my motivation has atrophied because the novelty has worn off and I may be training for the wrong goal.

I see the guys who do this show and they're all just athletic in general.  They're the kind of people who can get up on Saturday morning and decide ""I want to go rock climbing today,"" go take a trapeze or parkour lesson, or play pickup games of football/basketball/ultimate frisbee/whatever all afternoon.  It's like what I remember from when I was a kid - if they want to do something, they can just go do it, because they've got the baseline levels of strength, conditioning, and versatility to be reasonably competent all around.

That's really what I want - to be able to live an athletic lifestyle where I can use my body to have fun.  I don't need to be the strongest, the fastest, or have the most endurance, just to be strong, fast, and enduring enough.  And I'm not particularly concerned about the aesthetic side - if I've got my diet in line, being athletic like that will show.  I guess I'm exactly who Crossfit was designed for, but I've seen all the common criticisms of Crossfit and I don't want to go down that road.

So how do I get there?  I have some ideas, but I've never been athletic, so I have no clue if I'm approaching this right, and I'd love to hear from others with more expertise.  I've been feeling really drained lately (probably due to that not going to bed on time thing), so I'm taking this week off from the gym to rest up, fix my sleeping habits, and re-evaluate my training vs my goals.  Here's what I'm thinking for when I get back to work next week:

- Continue GSLP in the mornings MWF, adding in frequency method pushups and chins/pullups (maybe change to the 2 day per week plan in the book MF with bodyweight work on Wednesdays?).  Re-evaluate when linear progress ends.

- Start Couch to 5k MWF in the evenings to build my cardio capacity, followed by 20-30 minutes of screwing around on the neighborhood playground (climb stuff, hang from stuff, run up the slide, etc).  After the program, transition to running and the playground.

- 1 hour walk with the dog on Tuesday and Thursday

- Start doing the kind of things I want to be able to do on Saturdays - I live in a great area, so there are tons of options here.  I'm thinking something different every week, but stuff like hiking, trampoline park, indoor rock climbing, warrior gym, slackline, swing dance, trail run (eventually) etc.

- Rest on Sundays.  And by rest, I mean household chores and meal prep, mostly.  And a walk with the dog.

Am I on the right track here?  If not, what should I be doing?  How do you go from a sedentary to active lifestyle without killing yourself?

TL;DR - I want to be athletically versatile, not just a guy who lifts weights.  How do you get there starting from scratch?"
