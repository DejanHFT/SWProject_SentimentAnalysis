"In the Imperial (HRE) Election of 1519, the King of England (Henry VIII) was one of the three nominees. How common would it have been for a non-German, specifically and English monarch, to have been considered for this role?",MachoRandyManSavage_,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/doejq1/in_the_imperial_hre_election_of_1519_the_king_of/,75,1588,"The election of 1519 saw Charles I, King of Spain win the election against Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England. Was it common for outsiders to have been up for consideration for Holy Roman Emperor? I realize that Charles I, who would win the title, wasn't himself German (despite being Archduke of Austria) and spoke French. Can anyone provide some insight into the election of foreigners to the title?"
