Looking for Strategy/RPG with Playable monsters/evil,ZamorakHawk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/150hmyg/looking_for_strategyrpg_with_playable_monstersevil/,26,1,"I've been in a bit of a slump lately with games and would really like to break out of it. I'm searching for an RPG/Tactics game that has playable evil or monster characters.   


Something akin to Disciples 2; Letting you play as the Undead or demons, or Fell Seal/Final Fantasy Tactics that lets you tame and recruit monsters and use them in your team.   


Open to any and all suggestions, even if it doesn't directly fit the description. "
