Am I [f/35] not being a supportive girlfriend to my boyfriend [m/49]?,Agreeable_Remote9193,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/v40l3w/am_i_f35_not_being_a_supportive_girlfriend_to_my/,12,2,"My boyfriend is an artist and he has events every weekend to sell his things. He wants me to attend with him every weekend for support and I've went pretty much went every weekend for the past 3 or so months. But I feel that I need to slow down and maybe go every other weekend with him but he sees me not going with him as me not fully supporting him.

He says I help keep him focused and he loves when im with him and also that he doesn't want to be left with temptation as there are many women at these events that run into the a.m. He's right there are plenty of women there. He's struggled with sex addiction in his past and I guess he feels that the temptation can get ahold of him and he doesn't want to sabotage our relationship.

I'm sort of a low to moderate energy person, I suffer with anxiety and I'm introverted so these shows while fun can be draining and I need time to recover in addition, I have a 17 year old who I think prefers that I not go every weekend. She is always invited but hardly ever wants to go. Also, he's a lot to take him so just being with him for the weekend takes a lot out of me.

Do you think it's unfair of me to support him every other weekend or do you think to be a more supportive partner that I should go every weekend?

Tl;dr Boyfriend wants me to support him by going to events with him every weekend but I'm getting tired and just want to go every other weekend. Is this wrong of me?"
