Literary/Author/Genre Festival Recommendations?,kron0s80,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/16f6mxb/literaryauthorgenre_festival_recommendations/,12,16,"Hello!

I listen to the Hugo, Girl! podcast and heard them discuss an annual Moby-Dick Readathon that happens annually at the New Bedford Whaling Museum. It made me wonder about other similar/tangential events that, while not as well known, are beloved by their respective fans. 

All that to say, what other literary/authorial/genre specific events do you know of or attend and recommend to others?"
