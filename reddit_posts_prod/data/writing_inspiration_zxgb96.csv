"Writers, what do you think is more valuable to you: Inspiration or technical skill?",Meii345,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/zxgb96/writers_what_do_you_think_is_more_valuable_to_you/,181,182,"Inspiration example: it's a story about a little girl wearing a red hood lost in the woods. The twist is that she's a ghost. I will draw a parallel between the wolf and the girl, it makes my story more unique.

Technical skill example: being able to convey that the little girl is scared, litter around hints that she's actually a ghost without saying it outright, knowing how to start the sentences, ability to just... Write something that is more than just a basic description

For me, I'm kinda split. At this point in time I'm tempted to say I just need technical skill, because I have way too many ideas and I don't know how to start writing them and do them justice. But also... Inspiration is kind of the basis of it all. Without it, no passion, no want to write, no story. Plus, it could be argued that technical skill just need to be worked on and you get better at it? But then, that's also kind of the case with inspiration, you just need to rest your mind for a few days and! Boom! Ideas! But I'm guessing that also changes depending on the person you're asking. But if you have it my way, inspiration is easier to come by and less work overall.

What do you all think? I'm asking for personal opinions here, I don't think there is a ""right"" or ""wrong"" answer"
