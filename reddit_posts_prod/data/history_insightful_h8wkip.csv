Did people drink as much alcohol throughout history as it is portrayed in media/entertainment?,Bigringcycling,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/h8wkip/did_people_drink_as_much_alcohol_throughout/,301,741,"This is a quite broad question since this can go back thousands of years up until more recent history. It seems in media/entertainment (even in documentaries with re-enactments) people drink alcohol often, almost the way we drink water now. Was this accurate? Is it because the process reduced harmful diseases/bacteria? I know the brewing/fermenting/distilling processes were hit and miss in terms of alcohol content so is it the fact it just had low alcohol content? Was more equivalent to people drinking kombucha?

Lastly, if they did drink as often, do we know of health issues linked to the consumption?

Thanks so much for your responses.

Edit: Thanks to everyone for the responses, insight, and discussion. It was a broad topic which allowed for some details about random parts of history. Cheers to you all!"
