Is inspiration good? How do i take inspiration from a way a story has been told and use it or change it into something i can use?,Dread_of_bed,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/wn22js/is_inspiration_good_how_do_i_take_inspiration/,12,0,"I have some media i really enjoy to think about and i would like to create something similar, but is taking inspiration bad? What is the proper way to take inspiration? 

My main goal is not to make another rendition of the original media but to take certain elements and story telling methods and tones/themes and make my own story out of it, how do i take the inspiration correctly so i ultimately create something different from what i was inspired by but with parts in it that are similar to the very thing i was inspired by"
