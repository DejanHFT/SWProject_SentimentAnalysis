What is your literary “one hit wonder” (a favorite book by an author whose other work you find mediocre)?,ImpartialBombs,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/a4oi7i/what_is_your_literary_one_hit_wonder_a_favorite/,176,74,"I’ll start: Michael Chabon for “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.”

I’ve read AAKC twice and loved it both times. When I come across it in a bookstore, I’m tempted to buy it—despite owning two copies—because it’s so good. 

I’ve read Mysteries of Pittsburgh; Wonder Boys; The Yiddish Policemen’s Union; Telegraph Avenue; and Summerland. 

They were OK, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to recommend any of them. 

I can’t count the number of times I’ve urged someone to read AAKC. 

So, how about yours?"
