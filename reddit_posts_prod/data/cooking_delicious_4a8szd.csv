Crockpot + Corned Beef + Date = Delicious meal & First kiss.,Issues420916,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/4a8szd/crockpot_corned_beef_date_delicious_meal_first/,71,262,"As a partially Irish man (30) I decided to make my first Irish meal. [Corned Beef, Carrots, Potatoes, Onion, And cabbage. The standard](https://imgur.com/gallery/bH3aF).





Not only did this [recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/84270/slow-cooker-corned-beef-and-cabbage/) create an amazing meal, it also created a wonderful night. After starting the meal before work I decided to invite a Co worker over to enjoy it, after a night of good food and great laughs I managed to pull off a nice kiss at the end of the evening. 





Current mood: Proud and well fed.




**Edit-** Copy and paste fail, that was a cat, not food...)




**Edit 2** - My day is coming to an end and I wanted to take a moment to thank everyone for the love and feedback you shared on this post. I actually shared the post with my female friend and she thought it was very nice, I am also happy to be top post on /r/Cooking for once!




Thank you all and have a good night!

**2 year Edit -** 2 years later after living together she told me it was over and hung up the phone. It was almost the same exact time as our first kiss."
