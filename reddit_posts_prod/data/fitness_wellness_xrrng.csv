"Get rid of your foam rollers right now! (Well, okay, maybe don't get rid of them...but watch this vid)",shiarua,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/xrrng/get_rid_of_your_foam_rollers_right_now_well_okay/,71,63,"So probably about 2 months ago I joined Top Line Gym in Glendale, WI because I was looking for a better place to train/lift that wasn't geared towards middle aged house wives (*cough*Wisconsin Athletic Club*cough*).

Anyways, the guys who own it bought a Black and Decker car buffer one day and were using it on their muscles. I must say, thing thing is almost 100x better than a foam roller, much faster, and it feels wonderful to use on myself. I bought one for home use and the best part is they aren't all that expensive ($30). I usually use it before and after lifting, making sure to get my quads and hamstrings real well (hamstrings have always been a trouble spot for me). Not only is it great to add to your warmup, but I have found, especially with squats, that the weight just feels lighter after hitting all the tight spots.

Now I can't take credit for this, but I needed to share this with you.
