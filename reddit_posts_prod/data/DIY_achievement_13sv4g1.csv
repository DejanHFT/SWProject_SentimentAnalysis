Using Sprayer on Window Trim?,6thDAY,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/13sv4g1/using_sprayer_on_window_trim/,9,4,"I hired a painter to paint 4 of my window trims with SW Urethane Enamel Trim Semi-Gloss paint and he used just a brush. He only painted one but afterwards, I could feel and see the brush strokes, and didn’t like it. Maybe I should have asked him to back-roll?

Anyways, I ended up using an orbital sander to sand down the semi-gloss and it feels very smooth now.

I’m planning to use the Draco TrueCoat 360 Variable Speed Sprayer to just spray the trim so it gives it a nice and smooth finish. However this is my first time using it. I’ve read so many posts of people advising not to use a sprayer, especially inside.

But I really hate seeing brush/roller marks. Is using a sprayer that difficult if it’s just for trim?

Would I be able to achieve the same smooth result without stippling using a brush and just back-rolling?
