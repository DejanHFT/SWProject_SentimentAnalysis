Personal goal of achieving 20 pullups in one set,1man1motto,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8qk3af/personal_goal_of_achieving_20_pullups_in_one_set/,21,24,"I am currently doing the Fighter Pull-up Program to increase my number of pullups in one set. Currently I can do 13 pullups in one set, so my program consists of 6 sets descending of pullups (The first set I do 13, 2nd set I do 11, then 9, 8, 7, and then 6). After the first 2 sets I usually give myself 8 min rest, and then reduce my rest as I complete more sets down to 4 min. Is there anything I can do to improve my Pull-up program or is it good as it already is? Thanks!"
