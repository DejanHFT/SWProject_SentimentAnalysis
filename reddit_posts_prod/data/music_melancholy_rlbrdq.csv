rebus - Derelict (Piano/HipHop/Electronic/Space/Melancholy),Negative-Interview22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/rlbrdq/rebus_derelict/,0,0,"Hello  
I just started a year ago with producing. Always had a thing for music. Now I really need some feedback. Please let me know your honest opinion.

Here's a poem I wrote for it:  
*Just another form of pain*  
*To know everything's in vain*  
*Don't mind the insanity*  
*Knowing it is clarity*  
*They say, ""ignorance is bliss""*  
*What a hit and miss*  
*For happiness*  
*can only be valuable*  
*Once you realise,*  
*you're not infallible*  
*Sadness and misery*  
*Will it set you free?*  
*Someday it will,*  
*For in the past,*  
*it's but a memory*"
