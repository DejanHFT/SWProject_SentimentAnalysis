Looking for an adventurous Central American honeymoon,AKtheCAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/y3kh4h/looking_for_an_adventurous_central_american/,10,9,"Hi everyone!

My wife and I got engaged in Costa Rica.  We rented a car and went all along the west coast.  It was the best experience of our lives.  

We started down in Manuel Antonio, and spent some time on the beach in Quepos.  After that, the most incredible experiences in Drake Bay and Corcovado National Park.  We took a tour and saw dozens of animals we've never seen before.  Even our hike in Drake Bay we came across spider monkeys in the wild.  Monteverde Cloud Forest was incredible and beautiful and finally engaged at a resort in Arenal.

I'm not sure anything will compare to that trip, but we would love to do something similar, but branch out a bit.

We are leaning Panama or Belize from what we've read, but looking for advice.  Not looking for resorts and touristy stuff.  Beautiful unique environments, animals, and culture is our focus.

Thanks for your help!"
