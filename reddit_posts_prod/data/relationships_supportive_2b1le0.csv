Struggling to be supportive after my [25F] girlfriend [26F] lied about where she was and was possibly raped.,Throwaway113088,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2b1le0/struggling_to_be_supportive_after_my_25f/,111,84,"This is such a long story and I'm so confused right now.  
  
**Background:** In December, my girlfriend (Marie) was doing recreational drugs (**ETA** Vicodin, since it's been asked a lot in the comments) which she bought from her friend (Allen). I'm ok with recreational drugs as long as you're safe and responsible, but it was going a little too far for my tastes, and I asked her to stop. We had some back and forth, but she did stop. She did continue talking to Allen over text, which I didn't like, but they'd been friends for over 10 years, so I understood it. However, both I and Marie's roommate (Lynn) told her we thought this guy was bad news and didn't think she should be friends with him.  
  
**What happened**(I'm going to tell this the way it all unfolded, it's not chronological; I'm happy to clarify anything that I can, but a lot of it I can't): Tuesday night Marie and I hung out, nothing out of the ordinary. Lynn came home, we all had a beer and I left. Lynn and Marie hung out until Lynn went to bed around midnight. Marie and I were texting until around 12:30 when she said she had to go to sleep.  
  
I woke up at 7:15 as usual, to a text Marie sent me at 6am that was completely nonsensical and rambling. Assuming she had sleep texted me, I joked back ""did you have a sleep stroke? good morning!"" She sent another nonsense text. I asked if her phone was broken, more nonsense. By now I'm freaked out and tell her that. I tell her if she's messing around it's not funny, and to please let me know she's ok. By them it's time for her to clock into work where she can't have her phone, so I don't expect a response. I go into a work meeting.  
  
An hour and a half later, I leave my meeting and see a missed call and voicemail on my cell phone. From Marie. A 2 minute long, rambling nonsense voicemail. Her boss asked if she's drunk, she doesn't remember driving to work, she can't read her phone, she can't walk, Lynn is coming to pick her up. I immediately call Lynn and she confirms: Marie is not ok. I leave work, go to their apartment, we start driving to the hospital, and I call Marie's mom.  
  
Lynn tells me that Marie said she went to her mom's the previous night. Makes no sense. She hadn't gone over there until after Lynn went to bed at midnight, and her mom goes to sleep well before that. Now we're concerned.  
  
Marie's mom gets to the ER, we tell her and ask if Marie was there the previous night. She confirms, she never saw Marie, nor her car. A mystery.  
  
I immediately look through Marie's purse, to see if there are any pills. I then look through her phone (yes, privacy I get it, her and I have discussed it, we agree there are no boundaries in emergencies). I find she was with Allen the night before.   
  
I text him from my phone, confirm it's him, and ask what happened. I'm clear that she's in the ER, I don't care what they did, I promise he won't be involved if they were doing drugs, but to just tell me if she took anything. He promises all they did was drink, she slept on his couch, and was fine the last he saw her.  
  
Blood and urine tests come back, positive for marijuana (expected, we just got back from Denver), and benzos (expected, she has anxiety and took a Xanax Monday night **ETA**: the Xanax were/are prescribed, she generally takes either 1 or 1/2 of a 0.5mg pill) The doctor writes it up to dehydration and discharges her.  
  
By this point it's 2pm on Wednesday. She seems better, but confirms she doesn't remember anything from the previous night. We go get her car, and it stalls. All the oil has leaked out. Mechanic says her oil pan is cracked and asks what she hit. She doesn't know, she can't remember driving to work Tuesday morning.   
  
I take her home to sleep, and I go to work Thursday morning. We're texting and she keeps saying she doesn't remember anything. She remembers Allen making her 2 drinks, then nothing else until ~3/4th of the way through her ER visit. She asks me to stop by on my lunch break. I do.   
  
As soon as I walk in, first thing I notice are new bruises on her upper arms. Look like thumb prints. I immediately look at the back of her arms to see if there are matching prints, but there aren't. She's crying, still doesn't remember anything, but her thighs hurt. I take her to her mom's and go back to work (which I felt like a dick about).  
  
I go see her after work. She still keeps crying. She called Allen. He says they went to the casino Tuesday night, she doesn't remember. She flat out asked if they had sex, he says no. She's still sore.  

**ETA**: Casino story, per Allen: they went to pick up a friend of his, they picked him up outside, and never went in. Marie doesn't remember any of this at all.
  
None of us put things together soon enough for her to be examined in the ER, and she's already take a shower. We joke that we watch enough SVU we should know better. It's only kind of funny.  
  
We still have her clothes from Tuesday night in her backpack, she let me take pictures of her bruises, benzos can explain all of her symptoms. I don't want to pressure her into going to the police if she doesn't want to. That's her choice. But I wish she would.  
  
I'm really angry with her. For lying, mostly. And I feel so guilty because I KNOW victim blaming isn't ok, I'm vehemently against it. But in practice? It's so easy to just feel like if she hadn't gone to his house it wouldn't have happened. She's said it herself plenty of times. I keep reassuring her that anything that happened is his fault, not hers. She didn't do anything wrong. She wants to talk about her lying to me, but it seems so trivial compared to the possibilities. I'm angry, but I'm not ready to be angry yet. She just went to work, and her being out of my sight is making me sick.  
  
We're going to her family's cottage for the weekend once she's off work. Turning off our phones and running away. It's what she wants, and I don't know what else to do.



---   
**tl;dr**: Fairly sure my girlfriend was drugged/raped after lying and sneaking around. Struggling to juggle my own emotions and her well being.  
  
  
**ETA**: Since a lot of people have brought it up in the comments: at this point we have no intentions of going to the police. Unfortunately, the window of opportunity for a rape kit has passed, and we realize we don't have enough evidence to potentially destroy someone's life, especially with the doubts of what actually happened that night. Emotionally, to me, this guy will always be 'the guy who might have raped my girlfriend,' but I'm very aware of how false rape accusations can affect things. We're also aware that her history of drug use will simply result in a character assassination, and in her field of work if that we're made public, she would lose her entire career.  
  
I'd also like to point out my intentional use of the word *possibly*. She was possibly raped. She also possibly willing took a load of drugs and partook in a gangbang. She was also possibly abducted by aliens. Right now, I'm choosing to err on the side of caution and follow her lead that she was violated in some way. I would much rather be on her side and find out I'm an idiot than abandon her and find out something this traumatic happened to her."
