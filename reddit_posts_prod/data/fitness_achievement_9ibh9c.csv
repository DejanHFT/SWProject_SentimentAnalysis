Is there any fat loss benefit to cardio that would not be achieved by just eating less?,buzzardsgutsman,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9ibh9c/is_there_any_fat_loss_benefit_to_cardio_that/,62,141,"Ignoring the obvious health benefits of cardio for one second, and just looking at fat loss. Is there any reason why burning 300 cals doing cardio would be superior for burning fat than just eating 300 less cals, all else being equal? Does the type of cardio (HIIT vs LISS) make any further difference if at all?"
