My gym and my job don't mix well... Any tips?,scee117,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4qiqe7/my_gym_and_my_job_dont_mix_well_any_tips/,27,11,"I've been going to the gym for about 2 years now, and I've gained practically no strength.  I think I hit a plateau about 3 months in, and at best I'm on it, at worst, I'm working back up to it.  The reason is definitely my job:

My standard workday is 12 hours long, and it's split between physical labor (carrying things that weigh 30-80 lbs around, miles of walking) and being on standby to do more of said labor at a second's notice.  

Basically, I burn a ton of calories and get worn out at work, but it doesn't help me hit any strength goals.  If I have 2 days off, I'll work out on one of them.... aside from keeping plugging along, and taking the tiny gains I can get, do you fitness gurus have any tips to help me keep my gains against my work schedule?"
