Athrwys ap Meurig = the historical King Arthur?,Particular-Second-84,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/x2epcz/athrwys_ap_meurig_the_historical_king_arthur/,102,839,"A theory about Arthur which I find really convincing is that he was identical to the person recorded in medieval texts as Athrwys ap Meurig.

Athrwys was a prince of south east Wales, and it seems that he eventually ruled over Gwent, Glywysing (basically Glamorgan) and Ergyng (encompassing parts of Gloucestershire and Herefordshire).

Many of the early Arthurian texts place Arthur in South Wales, south east in particular. For example, Caerleon is said to be his main court in some texts, and he is also associated strongly with Kerniw in early Welsh texts, which would match the region of Cernyw in south east Wales (a large region that may have actually been another name for Gwent).

So Athrwys lived and ruled in the same place in which Arthur lived and ruled according to much of the earliest information.

And regarding when he lived, it’s true that most modern authorities place Athrwys in the seventh century, 100 years after Arthur. But not all scholars agree. Some place him in the sixth century.

Here is some evidence for this: The Life of St Cadoc tells us that Tewdrig, the grandfather of Athrwys, was the great-great-grandfather of Cadoc. It is universally accepted that Cadoc was an early sixth century figure. Since Athrwys was two generations earlier in the family line, then even taking into account long gaps between children in the line from Tewdrig to Athrwys, Athrwys cannot possibly have lived later than the sixth century. Therefore, based on this information, he must have been a contemporary of Arthur.

So, he lived at the same time as Arthur and ruled the same location as Arthur. Surely, then, he was Arthur? The name ‘Athrwys’ appears variously as ‘Arthwys’ and ‘Arthrwys’, and these could all quite plausibly be corruptions of the Latin form ‘Arthurus’.

Additionally, the family of Athrwys matches the legendary family of Arthur is various ways: 

- Arthur’s sister Anna (*HRB*) matches Athrwys’ sister Anna.

- Arthur’s maternal uncle Gwrfoddw Hen (*Culhwch ac Olwen*) matches Athrwys’ likely maternal uncle Gwrfoddw, king of Ergyng. 

- Arthur’s sons Morgan and Adeluf (*Le Petit Bruit*) match Athrwys’ sons Morgan and Ithel. 

- Arthur’s brother Madoc (*Dialogue of Arthur and Eryr*) matches Athrwys’ likely brother Madoc Morfryn.

- Arthur’s son Gwydr (*Culhwch ac Olwen*) may well match Gwrhitir, the possible son of Athrwys (he was either the son of Athrwys or the son of Morgan ap Athrwys).

- Arthur’s relative (possibly his maternal uncle) Iaen (*Culhwch ac Olwen*) likely matches Athrwys’ maternal uncle Ieuan. 

- Arthur’s father Uther Pendragon (*HRB*) matches Tewdrig, the grandfather of Athrwys, whose career matches Uther Pendragon in many key ways. And like Uther, he died when Athrwys was young. 

- Arthur’s cousin, an unnamed Irish king (*Life of St Padarn* if I’m not mistaken) matches King Brychan, the Irish cousin of Athrwys. 

The family of Athrwys is also known to have intermarried with the royal family of King Budic over in Brittany, which is the same dynasty that Arthur’s family intermarries with in the legends.

Edit: Most of these familial connections can be found in *King Arthur: The Man Who Conquered Europe*, by Caleb Howells."
