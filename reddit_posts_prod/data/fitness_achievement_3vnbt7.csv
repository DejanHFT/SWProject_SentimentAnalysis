Can flexibility be achieved at 40?,One_Cold_Turkey,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3vnbt7/can_flexibility_be_achieved_at_40/,11,6,"I used to practice lots of sports, was very flexible and fit. Then I stopped for around +10 years to ""discover"" the body has gone very rusty. No surprise really, but I would like to know if I could put my foot back in the air without flexing my knee (karate kick), put my forehead in my knees and all similar stuff.

And if yes, what sort of exercises would help to achieve this the fastest?"
