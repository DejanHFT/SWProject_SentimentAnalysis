How would a deep learning computer be replicated?,BoNTCuresAll,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/d26w64/how_would_a_deep_learning_computer_be_replicated/,1,1,"I recently watched a documentary about AI and deep learning and it made me wonder about how a deep learning computer would be replicated.  As I understand, a deep learning computer isn't programmed; rather, it teaches itself through experience and feedback.  And, in such cases as deep learning systems designed to detect cancers, facial emotions, etc., the exact way the computer learns to make these determinations is really a black box and we really don't know the way the computer 'learned' to determine the output.  This begs the question- could the computer be replicated once it becomes skilled through deep learning.  If we don't fully understand how it works, how could we replicate it?  Like children, would we have to train next computers de novo each time?  Would each computer, therefore, be unique even if taught with the same data set?  How could, say, cancer screening with these systems ever be adopted if you couldn't have multiple, identical machines making diagnoses?"
