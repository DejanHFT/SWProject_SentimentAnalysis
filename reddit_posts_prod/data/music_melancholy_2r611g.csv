Recommendations for acoustic / melancholy songs about addiction / alcoholism?,treehouse_girl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/2r611g/recommendations_for_acoustic_melancholy_songs/,22,2,"Hey guys, I'm recently sober and music has always had such a huge impact on my life.  I've been trying to find some songs that fit my mood right now and I'd love your recommendations.

I've been listening to songs like ""Jen is Bringing the Drugs"", ""Broadripple is Burning"" by Margot + the Nuclear So + So's, ""Hurt"" by NIN, etc on repeat lately.

Right now I'm feeling more melancholy / slower / acoustic music - anything introspective, haunting, etc.  I love most indie / singer-songwriter type stuff and generally really dislike country (sorry) although Johnny Cash etc is awesome.  Just can't stand the twangy Garth Brooks style.  Seems like many of the good songs about alcoholism and recovery are unfortunately country ;)

Any suggestions for me? Thanks!"
