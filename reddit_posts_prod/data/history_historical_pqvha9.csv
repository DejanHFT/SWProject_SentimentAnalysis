Are there any historical records of 'famous' warships from the Hellenistic/Republic period?,DomoArigato1,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/pqvha9/are_there_any_historical_records_of_famous/,58,638,"As the title states, did any individual warships, not fleets or squadrons in the Hellenistic/Republic period get widespread recognition for great feats?

Considering galleys were powered by oars —— feasibly an experienced, well fed and well trained crew could row faster, longer and be more maneuverable. Have any named ships been mentioned specifically in records as being exceptional in one way or another?

Thanks."
