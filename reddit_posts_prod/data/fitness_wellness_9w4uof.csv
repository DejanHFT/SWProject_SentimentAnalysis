Are my goals realistic and well defined? Is my methodology sound?,bashfulbastard,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9w4uof/are_my_goals_realistic_and_well_defined_is_my/,19,10,"Hey all, new here (and really to regimented fitness in general). I've done my best to educate myself via the wiki, but thanks for understanding any of my dumb questions//useless information//basic newbie ignorance. 

My question - as the title suggests - regards my fitness goals and whether they're realistically achievable and well defined. I also have a related question about my dieting & fitness plan to meet those goals. 

**My Goal: By new years 2020, I will weigh 175lbs with a body fat percentage of 13% +/-1%**

**My Stats**

Age: 24

Sex: Male

Weight: 179

Height: 6' even

BF%: unsure

Lift numbers: unsure

**What I've done in the past:**

Mostly non-regimented exercises, following the /r/bodyweightfitness  recommended routine on and off, running on and off, and rock climbing classes three times a week for the past two months or so - although I've dropped those in favor of membership at a crossfit gym.

**What I am doing:**

Firstly, I'm getting my diet in check. I cut out alcohol completely with the help of /r/stopdrinking. With the resources in the wiki I've calculated a diet of:

Calories: 2,550 daily

Protein: 140 grams daily

Fat: 87.5 grams daily

Carbs: 300 grams daily 

As far as fitness goes, I do hour-long crossfit classes five times a week, which tend to consistently keep me breathing heavy and sweating profusely. If for whatever reason I can't make the crossfit class, or class is canceled, I instead run for about 40 minutes (usually getting in about 4 miles). This is my plan until the new year when I come back to the states (I'm currently studying in south america and living with a host family) and have more gym and nutrition options. At which point I will adjust where necessary. 

**So, what do you think?** Where might I need to adjust in my diet and exercise plan? Should I modify my goal at all?

I appreciate you all and this sub a great deal, cheers. 

**Edit:** After using a few different home methods for finding BF%, I'm coming out at 18% +/- 1%"
