Give me some soups with delicious rich broth,Langlie,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/144q8o2/give_me_some_soups_with_delicious_rich_broth/,5,1,"Just in the mood for it. Ya know when you make chicken soup with a whole chicken and the broth becomes really chicken-y and rich. You almost want to drink the broth more than eat the ingredients. That's what I'm looking for. Meat, veggie, easy, hard, doesn't matter.

Ideally not with any super exotic ingredients though. I live in Maine and they can be hard to find here."
