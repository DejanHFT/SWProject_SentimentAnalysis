My boyfriend is kind and supportive but I find him annoying sometimes,copyrightedsilence,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14nenj3/my_boyfriend_is_kind_and_supportive_but_i_find/,4,0,"I (27F) met my boyfriend (29M) about 3 months ago. He is kind and supportive, we share similar views and interests, and our physical chemistry is strong as hell. But I never laugh at his jokes, I sometimes find him annoying, and I find myself nervous to leave him alone with my friends bc I’m afraid he’ll embarrass me. As a result, I find myself having to breathe a lot to avoid being mean to him. I sometimes fail too; I’ve certainly snapped at him before. I have the urge to break up with him for these reasons, but I also am pretty sure I have ROCD, which complicates these feelings. I think I love him, but I can honestly say I don’t always like him. I have shared all these feelings pretty openly and he’s handled them well and maturely, but it’s also confusing bc if I were him I’d leave my ass. I know he really loves me and wants to enjoy every moment he has with me. I’ve already told him I’m planning on moving in September and that our relationship is temporary and he accepts this too. Should I cut him loose now or see this fling through? I enjoy his company a lot of the time, but feel like he deserves more. 

TLDR: debating breaking up with my boyfriend because I’m not sure I like him as a person"
