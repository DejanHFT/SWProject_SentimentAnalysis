Science AMA Series: We are Moore Investigators and We Utilize Data Science to Make New Discoveries. AUA.,MooreFoundation_DDD,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2teeeg/science_ama_series_we_are_moore_investigators_and/,166,988,"We are 14 scientists who recently received Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Investigator Awards in Data-Driven Discovery.  We use data-driven techniques, data science methods, and of course data, to make new scientific discoveries in a variety of fields, including biology/genomics/genetics, physics/astrophysics, computing and mathematics/statistics.

We are joined by the Moore Foundation to answer your questions about what we do, how we do it, and why being data-driven is important for making discoveries in the natural sciences.
