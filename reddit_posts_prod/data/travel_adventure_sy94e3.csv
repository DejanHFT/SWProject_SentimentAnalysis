Help planning a 50% adventurous and 50% relaxing honeymoon!,glittersparklestars,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/sy94e3/help_planning_a_50_adventurous_and_50_relaxing/,19,8,"My husband and I are finally taking a honeymoon(!) in April. We're hoping to stay in 1-2 cities for a full week. We're located in Colorado, USA but would like to go out of the country. 

We'd like to go somewhere that:

\- Is warm

\- Has a beach

\- Has some adventure  


I'm more of a ""lay on the beach"" type, but he definitely is a little more extreme. He's into dirt-biking, hiking, etc. I don't think he could last a full week just on the beach. I'm ok with doing some adventurous stuff as well.  


We've considered Costa Rica, Mexico and Belize. However, just can't nail down an actual city we want to be in! Everything sounds amazing! I'd like to stay in a nicer hotel/resort, if that helps any.  


Budget is around $500 per night (not including flights.)  


Suggestions? Specific cities help a lot."
