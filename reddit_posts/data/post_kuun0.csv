Why do atheists spend so much time thinking about religions?,tooArgentinian,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kuun0/why_do_atheists_spend_so_much_time_thinking_about/,90,3,"There's something I do not understand about the whole atheist movement, I myself am neither religious or atheist, I just don't have enough time to think about that, but every now and then I find myself curious and I check out what wether religious or atheist are up to. I found out that atheist are constantly judging and looking upon other religions, where other religions are looking at themselves.   
Shouldn't them be embracing their atheistic nature and dedicating to science/history/facts, instead of wasting their time trying to disprove things that are based on ""faith""?  
I know that some will say ""Hey! Trying to demonstrate that religions are based on ""bad data"" is what bla bla bla"" That's something obvious, and it's also obvious that religious people won't mind it.  
But in fact I found that it's more about making fun of them. I don't get it."
