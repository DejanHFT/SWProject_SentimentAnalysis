How well can dips replace bench for strength?,epicerik5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2kqp1n/how_well_can_dips_replace_bench_for_strength/,41,48,"Hey fitit, Im wondering if you guys can answer a quick question for me. My sterno-clavicular joint has a growth plate fracture. So with that, I can't' bench. The technical term for it really doesn't matter for the question, I'm just putting the information out there. Bench is the only exercise I can't do because of it. Rowing, Pull-ups, floor press and dips are just fine. (Push-ups have the same effect as benching, but is less pronounced because it's less weight) 

My question is, Should I do floor press or should I do dips? I'm about to do starting strength and I want to make sure my ROM is alright.. Personally, I feel like dips would be better but I want a little more incite onto this. I'm thinking that the range of motion for floor pressing might not be as beneficial, as compared to just doing dips. But I'm also thinking that dips might have a different effect because it's upright instead of on your back.

Thanks for any responses, I apologize If im overthinking this.


EDIT: Thanks for the responses guys!
