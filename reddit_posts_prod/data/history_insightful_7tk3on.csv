"In the 60s Hippies where considered rebellious, in the 70 to 80s is was punks and rockers in the 90s it was ravers. But what did ""rebellious youth"" groups look like through different points in history.",SirAceBear,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7tk3on/in_the_60s_hippies_where_considered_rebellious_in/,754,4361,"I'm not really looking for a specific point so go wild. What did the ""bad"" kids look and do in the in the late 1800s, maybe the Renaissance, what about the middle ages. I just like to know what what considered breaking the ""norm"" back then.
