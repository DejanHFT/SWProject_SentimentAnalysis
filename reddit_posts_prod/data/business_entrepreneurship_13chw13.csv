Best Business/Finance Books To Read?,NightEscaper,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/13chw13/best_businessfinance_books_to_read/,1,5,"
Hi everyone, I’m fresh off college this summer and would be joining my father’s manufacturing firm which specialises in production of toffees and candies. 

I did my bachelors in business administration with focus on marketing but I won’t lie, I studied majorly for grades and I can’t say that I really learned much. 

If you can recommend me best books on marketing, finance, management and entrepreneurship, it would be great. I just bought Rich Dad, Poor Dad and Zero To One and am looking forward to reading them. 

Thanks."
