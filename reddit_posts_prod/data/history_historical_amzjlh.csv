What are some under-appreciated or obscure historical weapons?,BluEch0,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/amzjlh/what_are_some_underappreciated_or_obscure/,1317,2959,"Everyone knows about swords (in general). But less people know about the sword breaker (the European version, the dagger with the ridges on its back). Similarly, most people know about spears in general but most probably don’t know about the fletched javelin. 

What do you think is an obscure or under-appreciated historical combat weapon? 

Answers do not have to be weapons of war. Dueling weapons, cosmetic weapons, hunting weapons, police “weapons”, and to a certain extent ceremonial weapons are a suitable answer. Question is also not region locked so please talk about weapons from all corners of the world, but you may want to consider that I as well as many of the others are most likely a western audience and our knowledge of historical arms is probably limited to tabletop games, video games, cartoons, anime, books, TV shows, and movies. 

Under-appreciated and obscure, for the purpose of this post will be defined as not commonly known by the modern general populace, not portrayed sufficiently in popular media, or just so rare most people never even realized it existed. 

If you have multiple answers, please share!!!

Thanks guys! "
