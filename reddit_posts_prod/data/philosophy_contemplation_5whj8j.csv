What Schopenhauer means when advocating 'asceticism' as the solution to human suffering,Johnblegen96,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/5whj8j/what_schopenhauer_means_when_advocating/,18,83,"
Schopenhauer coined his assertion, 'the human is the phenomenal expression of the will to life' in an effort to gauge the bounds of our human capacity for understanding. In other words, all human endeavor is derived ultimately from the instinctual urgency; 'I must live.' Whatever thoughts we have, no matter how complicated they may seem, would not exist without this encouragement to work from; a will.

The implications of Darwinian studies seem to Bolster this notion. We know that natural selection is factual, thus, we know that the creatures with 'wills to life' best suited to their environments are invariably those inhabiting them today.

 While this explains well enough the implementation of emotions-such as fight or flight, and love, in pursuit of longevity-one might wonder what uses the will could have foreseen when equipping us with abstract concepts such as philosophy, or mathematics. Perhaps, it is a form of self appraisal; whereas the peafowl will grow their extraordinary feathers, the human will learn to philosophize. Otherwise, it may simply be a byproduct of the implementation of rationality.

Either way, though strained, these practices must ultimately be in keeping with the will to life. We may distort our wills to remarkable, beautiful lengths, but ultimately, this is the substance from which all subsequent contemplation relies on; the end of what is contemplatable. 

However, this has not stopped humans from at least attempting to transcend these bounds. The vein of absurdist existentialism rests entirely on this premise; that the world exceeds our attempts to explain it. The complexities of quantum mechanics, and human consciousness, in particular, come to mind when considering so. 

But for Schopenhauer, there was one such quandary resulting directly in the bulk of human suffering; our awareness, and subsequent incapability, to understand and explain the phenomena of death. 

This should not be surprising. How could 'the will to life' ever fathom it's own antithesis? So pervasive is it, even, that the majority of human theology has consisted in this pursuit; an enterprise in asserting that the human will, as opposed to every other will in the universe, is immune to eventual destruction. 

For many religions, this pursuit has resulted in death being perceived as some sort of ultimate Judgement. Expecting so much from ourselves, however, as if we were meant to do anything other than live, is where I believe so much suffering originates. We are 'the will to life',' not 'the will to righteousness' or 'the will to a stellar social life.'

The primary cause behind this suffering then, would have to be monotheistic religion. To suggest that there is some transcendent being judging our every move-that there is any purpose inside of us-other than 'the will to life' is a betrayal of the human spirit. This is not pointed out to bash religion; cultural expectations are equally at fault.

For Schopenhauer, the answer to this dilemma was a rejection of the will; he proposed asceticism. If the will to life is denied, then death won't appear so obscene.

I believe this step here, is where Schopenhauer goes astray to so many. He himself notes that the human is fundamentally 'the will to life', so, even if it did 'appear' that we were rejecting our wills, fundamentally, it would be merely the will engaging in hypocrisy. We can't deny the will, because it is substantially what we amount to. 

We can, however, use the greatest product of our wills-our rationality-to fully examine the universe, and our objective position within it.

What I believe Schopenhaur intended when advocating asceticism, is simply to not expect too much from ourselves. There is no transcendent being, no judgement awaiting us, so, to strive to live a 'meaningful' life, is absurd. This should not be met with disappointment, but rather, with unrelenting pride.

If God is dead, then that leaves we humans as the most extraordinary phenomena in the known universe. There may be neutron stars, black holes, and countless other overwhelmingly incredible phenomena to observe, but without the human, there would be no complexity to speak of, only monotonous happenings.

Yes, we will die, and this is a pretty substantial bummer, but while we are alive, phenomenally expressing our wills to life, we are the epitome of the universe; the most extraordinary phenomena it can possibly speak of; so, at the bare minimum, life is rather quaint."
