AskScience AMA Series: We're misinformation and media specialists here to answer your questions about ways to effectively counter scientific misinformation. AUA!,AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/j1x23h/askscience_ama_series_were_misinformation_and/,111,734,"Hi! We're misinformation and media specialists: I'm [Emily](https://twitter.com/saltzshaker), a UX research fellow at the Partnership on AI and First Draft studying [the effects of labeling media](https://www.partnershiponai.org/partnership-on-ai-first-draft-begin-investigating-labels-for-manipulated-media/) on platforms like Facebook and Twitter. I interview people around the United States to understand their experiences engaging with images and videos on health and science topics like COVID-19. Previously, I led UX research and design for the New York Times R&D Lab's [News Provenance Project](http://newsprovenanceproject.com/).

And I'm [Victoria](http://www.twitter.com/victoriakwan_), the ethics and standards editor at [First Draft](https://firstdraftnews.org/), an organization that develops tools and strategies for protecting communities against harmful misinformation. My work explores ways in which journalists and other information providers can effectively slow the spread of misinformation (which, as of late, includes a great deal of coronavirus- and vaccine-related misinfo). Previously, I worked at Thomson Reuters.

Keeping our information environment free from pollution - particularly on a topic as important as health - is a massive task. It requires effort from all segments of society, including platforms, media outlets, civil society organizations and the general public. To that end, we recently collaborated on [a list of design principles](https://medium.com/swlh/it-matters-how-platforms-label-manipulated-media-here-are-12-principles-designers-should-follow-438b76546078) platforms should follow when labeling misinformation in media, such as manipulated images and video. We're here to answer your questions on misinformation: manipulation tactics, risks of misinformation, media and platform moderation, and how science professionals can counter misinformation.

We'll start at 1pm ET (10am PT, 17 UT), AUA!
