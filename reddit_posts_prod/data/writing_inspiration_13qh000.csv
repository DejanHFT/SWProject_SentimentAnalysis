It is okay if i take inspiration from the place i am from?,Fit-Acanthaceae-4604,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/13qh000/it_is_okay_if_i_take_inspiration_from_the_place_i/,10,0,"I am beginning to write some stories, and I am mostly taking inspiration from the place I am from and its history. I am not gonna say the name of the place I am from, since it's pretty specific, and since there not many people in this place, it will be too revealing to tell its name.

I am a little insecure about that since, I am thinking that it may be revealing too much, or be awkward for the people where I am from. Do you think that it will be a good idea to take inspiration from what I am from, or should I search inspiration elsewhere?"
