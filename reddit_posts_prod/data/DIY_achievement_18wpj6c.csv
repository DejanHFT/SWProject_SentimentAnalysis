Refinish/replace wood floor - DIY or hire out?,Tactical_Terry_,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/18wpj6c/refinishreplace_wood_floor_diy_or_hire_out/,14,0,"I have roughly 1200 sqft of hardwood floor (including a staircase)that is in need of refinishing or replacement. 

It’s 20 or more years old now and showing its age and wear in high traffic areas. 

I’ve never refinished a floor before but I understand it to be fairly labor intensive. My wife and I have two kids and four pets in the house so our normal day to day is hectic, to put it gently. 

Taking on the task myself I think would require a couple weeks effort in my free time outside of work hours. My main concern about going the DIY route is achieving a uniform finish. 

Alternatively, I’m considering replacing the flooring. Current floor is oak plank and I’d look to replace it with something engineered to be more durable against the two- and four-legged wrecking balls running around our household. 

Looking for feedback from folks who have gone either route, pros/cons, things you wish you would’ve done."
