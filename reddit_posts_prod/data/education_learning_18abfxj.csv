Exchanging education for learning,JohnstonChesterfield,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/18abfxj/exchanging_education_for_learning/,10,0,"Education is a systematic, formalized, and mechanistic learning process. It silos information into topics and disintegrates the learning mind - drawing lines between what is related and what is not. The education system is not broken. It is just no longer fitting for the current conditions. Our world moves too fast to cram our children into a predefined 16-year learning path that doesn't accommodate any sense of individuality. Academia will die if it doesn't evolve. Academia is beautiful and I hope it can become more fluid.

Every human learns differently based on their experiences and perspectives. Digesting history may be better understood if taught in conjunction with music for those who are musically oriented. Understanding the mental models and ways of seeing that students hold is central to elevating their learning capacity. Teachers don't have time to do this. Teachers should have the ability to speak specifically about what they want, and are knowledgeable about, and have a system intelligent enough to integrate their knowledge with others into personalized learning paths for each student. Teachers are just as crippled by Education as students are. 

I want to see a future where the best minds can simply practice what they love, speak about it how, and when, and where they want, and have the information carried to those who wish to learn it how, and when, and where they want to learn it.

I know this is possible. I hope to be part of making it happen. I would love to connect with others who are passionate about building the next evolution of learning. I love learning and love helping others learn even more. I love this community and wish I could contribute to it more. 

I believe that  AI and LLMs will bring unimaginable change to how we learn. I fear those who fear it will delay its invaluable adoption. We need self-play and exploration to learn how to better learn.
