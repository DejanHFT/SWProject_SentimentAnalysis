Can you help me with this form for my college entrepreneurship class?,nathan_m_smith,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/mh5239/can_you_help_me_with_this_form_for_my_college/,1,0,"Hello! I was wondering if any of you would be willing to help me with this form for my college entrepreneurship class. It's all about conversations and speaking to those with experience.

I'm trying to measure how comfortable people feel with such a topic, and I was hoping to get your opinion.

Also, I know it is an outside link, but it's just a google form. I totally understand if you feel uncomfortable with an external link."
