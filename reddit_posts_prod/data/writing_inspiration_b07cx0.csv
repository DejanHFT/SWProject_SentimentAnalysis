What story or book series was your first inspiration to become a writer?,SnowyMacie,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/b07cx0/what_story_or_book_series_was_your_first/,53,30,"I was talking to my girlfriend last night about books and mentioned one my favorite book series as a preteen/teen, The Shadow Children series (Among the Hidden, Among the Betrayed, etc.) It's the series that inspired me to write my first short story as a freshman in high school. IT SUCKED, but it was the first time I wrote something purely for my own pleasure, the first world I built, etc.

What was yours?"
