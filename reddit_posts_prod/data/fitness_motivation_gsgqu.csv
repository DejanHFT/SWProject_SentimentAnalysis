2. I am incredibly enraged right now about the man tits. I hate them so much.

3. I'll be able to walk around without thinking about my body. 

4. I am already good looking. If I had a nice body I would be sexy. I would barely have any insecurity left. 

5. Once I have the body fat cut from my body, doing the preliminary gymnastic exercises will be a lot more practical. 

6. In social situations I won't have body fat to worry about, I won't be constantly shifting my posture or thinking about my fat/man tits. My thoughts will probably flow more easily enabling better conversation. 

7. I can eat more liberally while bulking.

8. Having a strong and fit body will alleviate much of the anxiety of living in a monetary society because I will be able to easily do laborious jobs without much misery.

9. I would feel extremely joyous.

10. I would feel more confident and more willing to approach the wilderness survival skills.

11. Losing fat wouldnâ€™t be a preoccupation anymore.
