Creative block??,28sizzlinbandit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/j9k1v2/creative_block/,4,2,I’m having a creative block and was wondering if any of you guys can maybe give some ideas or inspiration. I’ve got an art assignment due this week and I have to showcase how I’ve always been “blended” in an environment so like walking through life just like anyone and sharing same experiences. I was thinking something along the lines of painting a forest but now I’m hesitant as I think it’s too cliché. So yea I would appreciate any ideas that you guys may have!
