Question on DIY Floor Renovation and How to Achieve Desired Color,vagabondnature,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/186kh4r/question_on_diy_floor_renovation_and_how_to/,6,1,"We recently bought a house and the bedrooms have what I believe to be pine floors (you can judge for yourself).  Happily a friend has lent me his floor drum sander and I would like to sand the floors.  Some of the flooring presumably had furniture on it and is a lighter color.  This it the color we would like to achieve for the whole rooms.  A lighter, almost beech, or natural light wood look.  I welcome advice on how to achieve this.  That is, how can I maintain a freshly sanded look rather than a stained look?

I tried posting this on r/flooring but didn't get any responses.  Apologies for cross posting.
