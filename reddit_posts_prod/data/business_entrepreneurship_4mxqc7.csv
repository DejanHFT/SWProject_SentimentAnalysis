Tips on books for business strategy / internal development / entrepreneurship within major corporations,JohannesBrun,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/4mxqc7/tips_on_books_for_business_strategy_internal/,0,1,"FYI, there is a TL;DR at the end :).

Hey there Reddit. I've done some googling on this topic, but figured that with the vast amount of people in this sub-reddit, I figure I'd ask here. So basically, here's whats up:

I work in a major pharma company, within a business support function for an area consisting of about 500+ people (and growing). When my former manager took over the job, the department was not working well at all (this was about 3 years ago) and his task was to build up a stable organisation that could support the area with business related things (Building balanced scorecards, business plans, capacity planning, budgets et.al.). 3 years on, and we have come a long way, built a department which functions very well with its basis delivery and become known for high quality.

However, we recently got a new manager. Our new manager wants to continue developing our department by becoming more practice in our approach. So far we have mostly focused on working with issues which arise; know we want to be better at finding areas of improvement and bring attention of these areas to management, and start our own initiatives instead of just solving tasks for others.

For this purpose, I have been tasked with planning and executing a strategy day for our department, where we discuss and figure out how we can reach a point of, for lack of a better way of putting it, increased entrepreneurship within our area. I would therefore like to ask people here for tips on books/articles/blogs that could serve as a source of inspiration. I was thinking something along the line of:

- Organisational development
- Entrepreneurship within major corporations
- etc...

Any and all tips will be highly appreciated!

If none of what I wrote makes no sense, or if you just need more info, please feel free to write that to...

TL;DR - I have been tasked with planning a strategy day for my department and need tips on books/blogs/articles regarding the topic mentioned in the title. I work in a business support function in a pharma company, within R&D. "
