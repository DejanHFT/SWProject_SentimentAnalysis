Condemned,David12N,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1psw2u/condemned/,2,3,"Condemned to be free comes from Jean-Paul Sartre. It means if there is no god then there is no infallible moral code to live by. Of the moral codes we have like do the greatest good for the greatest number or do not treat people as a means to an end all these can be questioned disputed disagreed with. So we are left with  the responsibility to create our own code the freedom the responsibility to choose how we are to live in this world.   

For someone who is happy to live day to day working then going home to prepare for the next day the responsibility may not seem that great. For someone who is content to do incidental good such as helping someone up whom has fallen {if by chance you happen to be going passed at the same time} then the responsibility may not seem that great.   

Condemned to be free can have a far greater meaning though and can have a far greater meaning than even Sartre may have argued for in his work. If you consider the fact you are alive while billions have died or are not yet born you are here and now is significant and significant opportunity. If you consider the power of your mind far more complex than any computer that enables you to do more than just take out the trash.  

A mind and body that enables you to help solve some of the biggest problems in the world or enables you to learn a musical instrument to read philosophy to understand the world better. To decipher a dead language if you chose to or help save a dying language or help save an endangered species from extinction to help crack an unsolved case likes the Golden State Killer cold case. 

To create great works of art like one of Norman Rockwellâ€™s paintings celebrating the four freedoms to write a classic like Emile that tells us how to raise a kid to be honest in a dishonest world. To help bring medicines to those in need which through VillageReach we can  do with a quick online donation.  

We may no longer be able to say that with great power comes great responsibility only refers to a politician or a rich person but it now refers to us all. With being human comes great responsibility. Surely it would be wrong to be a type of superman or woman but not use our powers for good for anything.   

So what moral code should we choose what is our potential?  
Is there a code that is universal and right always or does it depend on the time or place in history when it comes to right or wrong as ethical relativists would argue? There does seem to be few codes that can be found in all religions in many cultures and that is to help those in need. 

It would be hard to claim to be a good person if you do not give regularly to charity for those arguments against giving have long ago being answered, like how will I know if my donation is really going to help. The group Givewell for one can answer that.    

The amount of suffering in the world warrants more than just incidental good. Surely charity should not be viewed as an afterthought only to do if the money is there and view as a recurring cost like the rent or the gas bill. It is after all a donation that given to an effective charity can alleviate some of the suffering in the world we inhabit.     

Perhaps an obligation to learn about philosophy to understand the world differently like the philosophy to view everything and everyone as if it were the first time you saw them. The 100 year old tree outside your door the million year old rock formation you walk pass the partner next to you  that once lite up the room but now take for granted.   

Learn about history and all we have achieved and learn and doing something about the things we have yet to achieve like ending global poverty. We should climb our mountains not because it is there or because we can but because we are obligated to. It can become much more important to live a full life when the impermanent nature of that life is regularly remembered.   

The question is often asked why does a loving god allow people to suffer there is no god is the best answer so far. The question however remains and then some like how does people who say they are good not give to charity? Why do humans who can do some much good so much more than go to work and come home choose not to do more? 

How does someone get bored when they can 
imagine any world in the mind and have an actual word to live in? A giant Disneyland to see and explore called Earth if one understands the responsibility the freedom a chance that questions can be addressed.   

One does not need to know anything about metaphysics to understand that not everyone has five hours a day to philosophize about the Golden Rule to do on to others as you would have them do onto you. Not everyone can read for themselves about the myth of Sisyphus if they were never taught to read. Read about a man destined to push a rock up a hill only to see it roll down again for eternity {and contemplate like Albert Camus did that it was possible, that even this laborer in the story could still be happy}.    

One cannot try to find out if Kant was right saying that we should judge an action on the intentions of the person doing it as oppose to the consequences. For if I choose to push a person out of the way of a moving bus which causes the person to hit three people killing them should I be held morally liable for that? One cannot learn the answer if your 9-6 job {and some weekend shift} does not give you the time. So what to do?  

Aristotle argued that we should do things in moderation. If one is too brave they can become reckless if one is not brave enough a coward and so everything in moderation. So read a chapter of a philosophy book or choose a random historical date to read about on Wikipedia take up a new language start to give more to a charity such as the Against Malaria Foundation or just start just by contemplating condemned to be free.
