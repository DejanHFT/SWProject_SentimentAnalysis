Need new creative hobbby,FindingFearless1106,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/ns21xe/need_new_creative_hobbby/,0,1,I have applied to many graphic design jobs as a graduate but no one has come back to me so I am giving up on that dream because I can't take the rejection anymore but I do want to keep my hobby of painting and drawing and anything creative I can create just to keep me sane. This can include making an outfit out of nothing and anything really. Any suggestions of what my next assignment can Be?
