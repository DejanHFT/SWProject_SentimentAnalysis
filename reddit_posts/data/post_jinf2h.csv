"We’re the NASA researchers hunting for water ice and other resources on the Moon, and we’re excited to take your questions! Ask us anything!",nasa,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/jinf2h/were_the_nasa_researchers_hunting_for_water_ice/,225,456,"Please post your questions here. We'll be answering questions on Tuesday, October 27 from 10:00-11:30 am PT (1:00-2:30 pm ET, 17:00-18:30 UT), and will sign our answers.

NASA’s flying telescope SOFIA recently discovered water on a sunny surface of the Moon – an exciting finding, as water could be much more widespread than previously thought possible. 
 
But how much water is there? Where is it? And could it actually be extracted and used by astronauts on future space missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond?
 
These NASA researchers are using rovers, orbiters, telescopes, and other technology in pursuit of answers as NASA sends the first woman and next man to the lunar surface under the Artemis program to prepare for our next giant leap – human exploration of Mars as early as the 2030s. One thing’s for certain: the Moon’s water and other resources could be a game-changer for future explorations into deep space!
