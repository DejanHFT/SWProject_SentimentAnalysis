What author is your greatest literary hero?,who_really_cares,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mk918/what_author_is_your_greatest_literary_hero/,130,42,"What author's writing and themes have most profoundly influenced your worldview or thinking? Whose writing just blows your mind?

Why?

Edit: Awesome input, guys! I think only one person has mentioned him, and I'd have to agree: Murakami. Favorite author doesn't always equal ""hero."" But Murakami is both for me. He brings beauty and meaning to little things and his protagonists always resonate with me. You can just tell that he's an interesting person based on all the pop culture and knowledge he weaves into his works. Genius. Also, after I read ""What I Talk About When I Talk About Running"" he mentioned how he sort of just ""picked up writing."" That blew my mind and made me believe that maybe someday I could do that. Also he runs marathons every year, which is something I want to do at some point myself. In short, I WANT TO BE HIM. "
