I can't feel muscle contraction well on triceps,Nickeh30s_schlong,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/128z6yj/i_cant_feel_muscle_contraction_well_on_triceps/,10,2,"When doing tricep exercises I don't feel the contraction, unless I go significantly past the ROM. It feels more like pressure on the elbow/tricep area, but it doesn't feel like a contraction as it does for other muscles. Also, it's not because my core is too weak since I'm watching in the mirror as I'm doing the movement and I don't use momentum when near failure and don't feel it in my core or other muscles."
