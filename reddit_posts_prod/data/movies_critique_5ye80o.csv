Films with promising concepts that were executed poorly?,discipleofdoom,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5ye80o/films_with_promising_concepts_that_were_executed/,498,176,"This is something I see a lot, especially in science fiction, where an interesting idea is presented to the audience but executed poorly. With science fiction films the interesting idea is usually downplayed in favour of a more action orientated story that studios think will be more appealing to a wider audience. 

Some examples:

* **In Time (2011):** What starts off as an intriguing critique of capitalism and wage labour quickly descends into generic action set pieces and hackneyed romance. Oh, and it also stars Justin Timberlake. 
* **Surrogates (2009):** The premise of _Surrogates_ is probably more relevant today than it was when it was filmed, in a world where almost everyone exists behind an carefully curated version of themselves crafted via social media, a film about people living vicariously through robot bodies could of been an interesting piece on identity and authenticity. Instead it is used as an excuse for explosions and mindless action. 
* **Repo Men (2010):** Not to be confused with the far superior _Repo Man_ (1984), this film had an interesting message about the commodification of the human body buried somewhere in there. The only redeeming feature is it's twist ending which will make you feel equal parts confused and angry at the same time. 

What are some other examples of films with interesting premises that were executed poorly? They don't need to be science fiction. "
