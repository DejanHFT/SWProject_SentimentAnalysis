"What is your favourite book, that is at least 100 years old?",VengefulMight,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12kw5x2/what_is_your_favourite_book_that_is_at_least_100/,2229,2560,"For me it is Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Stevenson didn’t just create an amazing literary work but the metaphor for the hidden depths of the human soul. It touches into science fiction but the possibilities are endless.

It was highly innovative at the time and the stage play that came of it was so impressive that actor who played the role was falsely accused of being Jack the Ripper, because people couldn’t believe someone could be that diabolical."
