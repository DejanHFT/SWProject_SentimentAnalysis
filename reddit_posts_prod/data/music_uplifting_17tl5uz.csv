Why do some people consider happy/uplifting songs less serious compared to sad songs?,-greek_user_06-,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/17tl5uz/why_do_some_people_consider_happyuplifting_songs/,22,21,"This is a question that has made me puzzled for some time. Why do some people consider happy/uplifting songs less serious than sad songs? Is it because of the vibes? The structure? The meaning? And what is ""serious"" music anyway? 

Don't get me wrong, I obviously know that some songs have deeper meanings compared to others. But I still don't think that a song about partying with your friends, for example, should be diminished compared to a breakup song."
