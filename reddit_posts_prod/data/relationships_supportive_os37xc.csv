How can I (28f) be supportive to my high maintenance (33f) friend who isn't taking care of herself?,sultrysad,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/os37xc/how_can_i_28f_be_supportive_to_my_high/,16,7,"I've known this friend for a little over a year-- she's someone I met through my wife, who met her through the festival scene. Trouble is her behavior, and typically I'd just cease to spend time or energy on someone with these behaviors but I genuinely enjoy her company when she's taking care of herself. 

Little back story, this friend used to work a seemingly cushy job in the tech industry and some genuinely terrible sh\*t happened to her (was dealing with an emotionally abusive ex, got hit by a car while on foot and had high medical bills, job wouldn't allow for her to miss work despite having staples in her head) and so she quit that job in pursuit of her mental well-being. Our friend group was really supportive of this decision. But this was months ago. To my knowledge she isn't looking for other work still and actually doesn't even have an ID right now (it's expired and though I've offered multiple times to help her obtain a new one as I do that for work she's declined). This has given her ample free time. She has a boyfriend but he works a stressful job and she doesn't see him often. I've never even seen her apartment because she reports it's too dirty for company and she's ashamed. She also reportedly has an auto immune disorder and spends a lot of time getting tests done at the doctor (my medical knowledge is next to nothing so I cannot elaborate any further here, even though I've inquired multiple times about which disorder and how to support her). Because boyfriend is busy, it feels like she has pretty high expectations for our friend group in terms of supporting her. Trouble is, she doesn't seem to be supporting herself and we are all busy adults. I myself have a wife, a job in social services, and am in graduate school. Not trying to be a d\*ck here but point being my time and energy are limited at the moment. When I do see her (which is about once a week) she complains endlessly about her situation; to the point where no one else in the friend group can get a word in, sometimes. Tbh it's pretty draining but we care about her and want to help.

Yesterday, I invited her to come floating on the lake with my friends and I. She doesn't have a car and expects rides everywhere and every time we do anything, but I can often not accommodate this due to proximity and time. She says she can't afford ubers due to unemployment and refuses to use public transit (it's very streamlined and affordable in our city). Naturally she asked for a ride and I explained my car was full so she didn't come. She messaged me and asked if I could hang after floating but I explained I have an early morning at work and also had some homework to do. She responded as if she understood but then made a melodramatic feeling post on her instagram story that seemed pretty obviously targeted at me-- something about how even when she expresses her needs friends don't come through and she's tired of of friendships not being reciprocal. 

I want to support her, but am finding it damn near impossible to do that when for me it feels like she isn't supporting herself. I've tried suggesting help with the ID, insight as to how to use public transit, job openings I hear about, and as much emotional support as I feel I'm able to give. I know my personality is kind of rigid with boundaries at times and very independent, so I'm asking for advice on how to maybe handle this in a more sensitive way? I need to respect my own boundaries in terms of time and energy especially because I also have a lot on my plate but I can tell she's feeling as if I (and our friend circle) don't care about her. Also, selfishly, I sometimes dread her company because again and as mentioned above, it feels pretty draining lately.

TLDR; friend (33f) who is high maintenance and not caring for herself well is expressing dissatisfaction with myself (28f) and our friend circle. We are a little unsure as to how to help her but care about her and are seeking advice."
