"Let's play a game. List a food/ingredient that you absolutely hate, and someone else replies with a recipe that might change your perspective on that food/ingredient.",Scarlet_Highlander2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/u79f2e/lets_play_a_game_list_a_foodingredient_that_you/,7225,10827,"For example, I hate liver. To me, it has a nasty bloody, mineral-y flavor and the texture is akin to an eraser. Surely there's some dish out there that might make me like it?

Also, if you can't eat a certain food due to allergic or religious reasons, don't list it. Making shrimp 50 different ways will still kill you. But it will be delicious no doubt.

edit: If you have the cilantro soap gene then thereâ€™s nothing we can do for you. Sucks to suck I guess. Use parsley if you still want the greens without that offensive cilantro taste."
