It seems like nobody is embracing real innovation and would rather live in the 1970s or something from all these commercials you see.,Euqinueman2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/rdskl4/it_seems_like_nobody_is_embracing_real_innovation/,21,3,"I just keep waiting and waiting and waiting.  I shouldn’t have made the mistake of watching old commercials on YouTube, because I compare this year’s commercials to those, but even if I hadn’t, I’d still notice.  First, I’ll describe some of those ads from the ‘90s to show how technologically forward-thinking they were, how they advertised things that were ahead of their time, that I didn’t even know they had then.  In late 1992, a voice-activated car phone!  A 1993 Magnavox ad concerning... unbelievably, a remote-like device with a screen that could actually type what you say by voice recognition, like you’d say, “record this show at 10:00, and then you put this near the VCR and it instructs the VCR to record the show!  You see what I mean?  What?  Homelink, whereby the lights would automatically switch on in one’s house when their car approached, in a mid-1995 commercial!  You see?  Now, let’s compare that to this year’s commercials.  There are multiple truly innovative things that I read about over two years ago now, that they STILL say nothing about!  Smartphone control of appliances, voice control of appliances!  WHERE IS IT?  They said they were making countless devices with Alexa and Google Home recognition in 2019, over two years ago!  What of progress?!  What of the magic of technological device innovation, where the true innovation is!  What of being able to say, “Back in my day, we didn’t have this snazzy stuff.  We’ve come a long way!”  Don’t you care about that?  These ads..  Turn the page, the future, new era!  No, no, no.  Instead, this!

For one example, Google, a tech company with all this state-of-the-art technology.  What do they show in their ads?  How about searching Google to buy CANDLES!  AND... drum roll... a Turn Table!!  @#$#@#$#@  Of course!  EVERYone just loves those fantastic turn tables now in 2021!!!  So Google, instead of EVER talking about their smart display anymore, which itself can play music, encourages people to reject innovative devices and re-adopt anachronistic technology.!  Come on people.  Why are they so scornful and opposed to true innovation, to entirely new revolutionary capabilities like voice control of appliances and so forth.  No, turn tables!  Seeing all these turn tables and records in commercials is maddening,  I can’t take any more!  That was outdated by 1980, if not even earlier, 42+ years ago, and yet all these people younger even than that have re-adopted it!  That’s a great example of what I’m talking about.  Touch of Modern .com always showing that turn table.  So turn tables are modern I guess!  THAT’s what they showcase.  “modern”!  Turn Tables!  Always with the turn tables!!!!  Please.. please stop.  Is it 1900?  What about smart displays!  Google won’t even advertise its own technology!

Dinosaur eye-sore CRT TVs shown in commercials, Sprite!, IMDB, etc., dinosaur eye-sore cassette stereos as old as the aforementioned TVs in too many commercials, one is too many, let alone that many!  Intentionally making ads look like they’re on Super 8 film!  Famous Footwear, more.  STOP.  IT. NOW!!!  That one’s kind of new.  They’ll probably have to ridiculously predictably and maddeningly do more like that even in 2022!  Don’t follow the stupid infuriating trend for once!  NO MORE of that!  Yeah yeah, go ahead. Argh!  Super 8 film!  Of course!  You see what I mean?  Outrageous.  NOT in 2022!!!!  Just watch, you’ll see.  As if the picture resolution weren’t already bad enough.  They have 8k now, yet they’re making commercials look like they’re on Super 8 film!  And look at Licorice Pizza!  It’s set in the early ‘70s and look at how poor the picture resolution is!  And that’s another thing.  At least 70% of the movies this year have been set at least 3.5 decades ago!  There are still many more examples, but I think that‘s enough."
