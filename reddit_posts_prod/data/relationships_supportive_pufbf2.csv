My (28F) boyfriend (30M) is not good about being emotionally supportive.,DarthInvadeHim,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pufbf2/my_28f_boyfriend_30m_is_not_good_about_being/,11,45,"
My boyfriend (30M) and I (28F) have been together for almost two years. We also live together. I’m mixed (half-white and half-black) while my partner is white. This is relevant in the context of the post.

An incident happened today where I stumbled upon the recent brutal homicide of a man I knew in high school. This touched me deeply for a number of reasons I won’t get completely into, but my grief drew a degree of introspection related to my race, the state of affairs of the black community in my city at large and what it means to be a black woman.

While I was experiencing this, I was reluctant to tell my boyfriend about my thoughts initially. I have a hard time being emotionally vulnerable, but I just had a feeling that he wouldn’t respond in a supportive manner to my feelings. 

When I mentioned my reluctance, he thought that I wouldn’t speak to him about it because he’s white. This is not true as I have a reached out to a few of my close friends (also white) to bend their ear a little and have received support or at least condolences.

When I opened up to him later today, I put into words how this was touching me (the feelings of ostracization I sometimes feel, my perception of my lack of duty to the community and the tragedy his loss represented). Other than to counter me on an opinion I had (the media doesn’t give a shit about POC going missing) and can you talk a little louder, it sounds like your whispering, I got no feedback whatsoever. No questions, no statements, just silence. At the end, I awkwardly told him I was going to lie down and shuffled away. 

Reddit, I feel like I’m overreacting. He asks me to open up, but I always feel lonelier after the fact, particularly now. I’m lying awake feeling worse for having shared these types of feelings with him.

TL:DR: I shared some race related feelings about a homicide incident where I knew the deceased and my boyfriend barely reacted."
