What is the most recent goal you set and when do you want to achieve it?,plasticbills,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3f9858/what_is_the_most_recent_goal_you_set_and_when_do/,128,23,"Maybe you even already achieved it. If you did, congratulations. 

I want to join the 1000lb club by the end of this year, and if not, I want to atleast achieve a 2/3/4 plate bench/squat/deadlift, one of which I've already achieved (the squat). 

So what are your goals?"
