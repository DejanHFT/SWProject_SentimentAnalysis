Re-doing porch posts,xyz17j,https://i.redd.it/cmng2mt3pe8b1.jpg,6,5,"Want to re-do these wood posts on my porch as the paint is chipping and showing it’s age. Wife wants them to have a natural wood look. I’m kind of a DIY noob, what kind of products would I need to successfully achieve this? Should I start by applying a paint stripper? I plan to sand them down and see how the wood looks. Then would I just use an exterior stain? Would I want a deck product or is there something else? Thanks!"
