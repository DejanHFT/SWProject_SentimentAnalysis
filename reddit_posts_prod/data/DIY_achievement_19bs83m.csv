Chalk Paint Help,mrdonni,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/19bs83m,2,1,"Hi All,

Wanted to give my bedside table a refresh. I had sanded it back with 80grit, applied 2 layers of Rust-oleum chalk paint. I’m not happy with the texture, I sanded the paint back with 600 grit, however some parts were stripped too far and expose some wood.

I’m learning, and open to suggestions to achieve a smooth surface."
