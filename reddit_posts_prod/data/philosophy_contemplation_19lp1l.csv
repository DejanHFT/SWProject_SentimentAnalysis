Question on Epistemology/Existentialism/Analytic A Priori,Daniel_Yusim,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/19lp1l/question_on_epistemologyexistentialismanalytic_a/,10,11,"Hi, Reddit (first post here!!) So I'm taking Epistemology with Peter Klein himself and have an essay I'm writing now where he wants us to come up with an original, well-supported claim about something in the reading (I have no doubts that he has high standards so I need my essay to be damned waterproof). Anyhow, I'm writing on one of Conee's and Feldman's essays on Evidentialism (I believe it's the most recent one, it's simply entitled: Evidence). In section 2.2, they discuss A Priori evidence and I was sure that they were going to list Analytic A Priori as evidence for the propositions they entail (and he seemed to suggest that I would find them supporting this conclusion). Not so. To my amazement, they write ""It is also possible to argue that some propositions are self-evident, in the sense that mere contemplation of them necessitates one's having justification for them. On this view, necessarily if one adequately considers one of these simple propositions, one is justified in believing it. (I would argue that this MUST be true for all tautological truths) We believe that sometimes when a person contemplates a proposition, the person acquires evidence supporting its truth. It is not the case that everyone gets this sort of a priori evidence by contemplating the same propositions. Just as some people may have more acute visual faculties, some may be better able to get the evidence for some truths than others (I assume here they mean other people) in this a priori way."" Then, they say that ""a priori evidence for the principles supports them in a broadly inductive way.""

CLEARLY, they must be talking about synthetic a priori and forgetting about the analytic... right? I know that Kripke and Frege would say that Hesperus and Phosphorus ""The Morning Star"" and ""The Evening Star"" (which are both actually planet Venus) both referring to the same object would be a case of synthetic a priori where inductive reasoning is required and sure, a rational thinker may not have the doxastic belief that they are one and the same but I want to argue that the same does not go for analytic a priori.

No rational thinker would, knowing the definition of a triangle, be unjustified in believing the proposition that a triangle has 3 sides.. These things are true by definition. The definition of a triangle is ""a polygon that has three sides"" so anything that falls under the definition of being a triangle has to meet the conditions of being a polygon and having three sides, otherwise it's not a triangle. I wouldn't think that we needed anything besides the definition of a triangle to justify our belief in the proposition that an object has three sides when we are given the premise that it is a triangle. We can fail to do that only because we lack the definition or because we don't understand the meaning of entailment. Such reasoning is deductive and not inductive, as they suggest.

I also don't know whether or not this is a point against the notion that evidence is necessary for justification or not. I could see how some things are true purely by definition but I can also see how you can argue that we infer beliefs (say, that all triangles have three sides) from the definition and use those (or just the definition) as evidence for the beliefs themselves.

Any help would be appreciated. And if I'm misunderstanding something, PLEASE tell me because I'd rather fix that now than submit a paper based on a misinterpretation."
