kind and supportive bf is cruel and vindictive in my dreams,throwRA670543168,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/edb0gj/kind_and_supportive_bf_is_cruel_and_vindictive_in/,12,2,"hi everyone, i hope this is the right subreddit to turn to! coming at you from a throwaway account.

my (23F) boyfriend (27M) of 2 years is probably the most supportive, gentle, and sensitive person i've ever known, but for some reason, almost every time he shows up in my dreams, he becomes \*awful--\*verbally and emotionally abusive, either already cheating on me or making obvious plans to, manipulating me or being cruel in myriad ways. in my dream last night, i must have pissed him off in some small way, because he spent a long time telling me in detail how he would cheat on me and why so many people would be so sexually interested in him.

we both share the same stance on cheating, which is that it's unacceptable, and i can say with confidence that he would never do or say any of these things in real life. further, i've spoken to him about some of these dreams before, and it was deeply disturbing to him that my subconscious portrayed him in such a negative light. it's disturbing to me too. sometimes the dreams are so vivid and upsetting that i wake up feeling physically anxious, and a couple of times i've actually woken up crying.

does anyone have any ideas about why this might be happening, and why so consistently? (i would guess that these dreams have been happening for at least a year, probably longer.) of course we have our problems like any couple, but he's my best friend and such a great person. and as far as my relationship history goes, i have my suspicions about an unfaithful ex, but i don't think i'm carrying around any deep-seated, unresolved trauma about it. i also come from a loving family and as far as i know, there haven't been any traumatic experiences that might lead to this.

thanks everyone for listening.

tl;dr wonderful and supportive bf becomes awful, unrecognizable person in my dreams."
