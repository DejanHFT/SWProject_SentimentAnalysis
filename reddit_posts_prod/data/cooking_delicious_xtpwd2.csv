"What's a dish you originally hated because you had only had bad versions, but now love because you have had it done well?",Pumpernickel7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/xtpwd2/whats_a_dish_you_originally_hated_because_you_had/,1700,4936,"For me, it's chicken pot pie. My husband is from the Midwest and I have been teasing him about his people's food for a decade. When I was a kid, when my parents didn't want to cook they would give us frozen mini chicken pot pies and those are so gross. Fast forward to this weekend. I wanted to do something very nice and surprising for my husband so I made him The chicken pot pie recipe from the barefoot contessa using ingredients from our local farms. It was perfection-- I cannot tell you how delicious it was. I stood over the pot repeatedly ""tasting"" the rue before it went in the oven. The crust was so flaky and delicious, I couldn't believe what I've been missing all these years. I'm now going to try to make other dishes that I thought were awful when I tried them initially. What's the dish that's like this for you?"
