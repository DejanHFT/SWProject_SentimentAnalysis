Do you also take inspiration from people around you? How do the people around you react to it.,Mobile-Struggle9867,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18uyqwb/do_you_also_take_inspiration_from_people_around/,5,0,"Hi Everyone.

I am an amateur writer and I usually write short think-pieces. I take inspiration from people around me and usually directly pick up quotes which my friends or family have said. Their words trigger a thinking process in my head and I usually write about it. 

For eg: If my friend has an opinion about LGBT rights, then I will use their opinion, put it into my think piece and then write on the topic.

I just wanted to know if your friends and family feel offended or feel like their privacy is breached. I don't write anything with malicious intentions. Once my friend shared a family issue with me and I wrote about her situation as an example in my think-piece. She was anonymous but she asked me to take it down because it felt too personal. 

What are the ethics of writing about such things. What do you guys usually do and how do people around you react to it. "
