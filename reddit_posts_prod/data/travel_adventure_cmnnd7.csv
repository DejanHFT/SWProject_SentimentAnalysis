What would be your ultimate bucket list trip/destination/adventure be?,posu68,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/cmnnd7/what_would_be_your_ultimate_bucket_list/,47,2,"Saw a post not long ago from u/palaiologoiBismark about their horse riding trip to Mongolia and it sounded incredible.

It got me thinking about if I could do 1 trip right now what would it be (if money, time etc. Wasn't a factor). I really love the idea of travelling by boat down the amazon River, in reality I probably wouldn't be able to deal with the spiders and insects but the idea of it really intrigues me. 

So yeah, I was just curious about what other people would love to do, maybe your dream adventure could inspire someone else?"
