Historical firing squad question,superherohunt,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/68jf4o/historical_firing_squad_question/,288,734,"I seem to remember seeing or reading somewhere that back in the day (and maybe now, where applicable) when a firing squad was executing someone, one of the riflemen had a blank round in the chamber. The rifles were distributed immediately prior to the execution so nobody knew which one was the blank one. Apparently this was done so that no single man had to carry the guilt of having killed someone all their lives, because they could always believe that it had been them with the blank.
Does this sounds familiar to anyone else? I don't remember the movie or show but something explored this with some more detail. If anyone has any thoughts or info I'd love to hear it! "
