What has been your experience with Creative Circle?,scorpion_tail,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/1253hk5/what_has_been_your_experience_with_creative_circle/,24,2,"I’ve tried finding work through CC several times. It seems the process goes like this: Get that first interview with the recruiter to talk about what you’ve done and what you’re looking for. Get matched with a client that maybe does a phone screen. Then nothing. 

Except this most recent experience. I was scheduled for an in-person interview with a client based in a city I don’t even live in.

And when I emailed the recruiter to alert them to this, I was told her email about it got stuck in a Draft folder. I don’t know how that addressed the situation in any way. 

Has ANYONE had any luck with this agency?"
