Supporting my boyfriend has gotten me into debt and he can't pay me back,maximus_capacity,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17znmay/supporting_my_boyfriend_has_gotten_me_into_debt/,50,53,"Hi everyone!

I'm (25F) a full-time student and small business owner and I've managed to rack up some credit card debt. It's not an insane amount, but it still hangs over me every day and brings me a lot of stress.

I got myself into this debt because I was supporting both myself and my boyfriend (23M) for about 6 months. We've been together for just over a year. He agreed to pay me back when he got a job. He's been working for 4 months now and has paid back a little bit of the money, but then doesn't have enough to fund himself until the end of the month. I still find myself needing to help him out financially. The debt on my credit card just keeps on increasing.

I'm not really sure what to do. It's debt in my name so it's technically mine, but as per the agreement with my bf, he's the one that needs to pay it off.

Can anyone offer up some solutions or insight into this issue?

TLDR: Financially supporting my bf has caused increasing credit card debt and I don't know how to pay it off."
