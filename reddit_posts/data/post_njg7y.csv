"I had a question regarding the brain, and neurotransmitters... ",BoggleHead,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/njg7y/i_had_a_question_regarding_the_brain_and/,4,2,"I was having a conversation regarding AI the other day, and qubits vs. bits came up, we figured we wouldn't see any real impressive AI until qubits were feasible; due to the almost insurmountable challenge of programming sentience. And so we wondered which type of transmissions the human brain worked with. On one hand, a 'quantum-computer' brain seemed absurd, while on the other a brain working in 1's and 0's seemed archaic.  

Is it known whether the signals between neurons in the human brain more closely resemble bits, or qubits? Or, is it that neither one is an accurate description of the phenomena?

Thanks!"
