Best Clear Coat Spray on Bare Steel,chagawagaloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/pckhg0/best_clear_coat_spray_on_bare_steel/,36,25,"I have a large steel casting that I want to remain without any coatings that cover up the fact that it is steel, but it's started to rust. I'm looking for a good clear coating (Spray preferred) that I can apply to it. Ideally looking for a low gloss finish so it's not too distracting.

I've had a look online but there are a lot of options available and mixed feedback for this particular application.

What are everyone's preferences for clear coat sprays that might achieve this effect?"
