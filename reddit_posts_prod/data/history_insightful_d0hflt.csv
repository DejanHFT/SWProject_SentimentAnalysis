Was salt always used as a food flavorer? Was there ever a time or culture that didn't use it?,palmfranz,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/d0hflt/was_salt_always_used_as_a_food_flavorer_was_there/,687,3333,"Salt seems universal in cuisine these days. I try to eat/cook a lot of international foods and the only constant is salt (even in minuscule amounts). 

So I'm wondering if *everyone* always used salt. If not, was the lack of salt because they didn't have access to it? I'm guessing the most common way to get salt was to boil down seawater, or find salt deposits. But I may be wrong about that.

Any insights into this would be appreciated! Thank you!"
