How did early humans overcome hunger before mass agriculture and other similar technologies?,Potato_Salesperson,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/18zla03/how_did_early_humans_overcome_hunger_before_mass/,27,29,"It seems like we can’t go more than 7 or 8 hours before we start to get hungry for food and I imagine constant hunting would be a drain on the surrounding ecosystem no matter where you are. Even if a boar, or whatever, could feed a village/tribe on its meat alone, that is only going to stay good for consumption for so long and has its own risks for hunting it.

I’m seriously amazed we as a species managed to survive in the wilderness with our caloric requirements, assuming there wasn’t a massive shift in those between early humans and now."
