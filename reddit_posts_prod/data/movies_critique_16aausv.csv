Can anyone please explain Vampires Kiss to me?,GroundbreakingAd93,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16aausv/can_anyone_please_explain_vampires_kiss_to_me/,8,1,"I know that it is supposed to be almost a critique on loneliness and one night stands and relationships but how? I donâ€™t understand how him believing he is a vampire and he himself feeding into his own delusion relates to that. People online say that he is emotionally lonely and he creates this sort of fantasy for himself but where are the clues that he his lonely?

What is the meaning of the bat that flies in at the start and is that why he wants to become a vampire?"
