Help a noob at tactical strategy games,Plockertop,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/y7bnvm/help_a_noob_at_tactical_strategy_games/,11,5,"There is something about tactical strategy games that I really want to love. Im drawn to the art styles and isometric views, the stories, and the idea of optimizing moves for satisfying combos. But no matter how many times I try, I totally suck at them and can barely make it past the first couple missions. I genuinely have fun for a few hours before I inevitably get beaten down and demoralized haha. I want to give it one more fair try before I decide that the whole genre is not for me.

Any tips, videos, basic concepts, or any resources that can help a noob like me learn how to get into tactical strategy? And are there any “easy” games for starting out? For reference, I have tried a bunch of games over the years like Fire Emblem, Jeanne d’Arc, Front Mission 4, Final Fantasy Tactics, and Advance Wars. I own a bunch more but I can’t bring myself to try them until I get a more solid foundation. Any help is appreciated!"
