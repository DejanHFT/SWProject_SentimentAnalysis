"The ""explorer outfit""",mile-high-guy,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/10l5ykc/the_explorer_outfit/,18,7,"What are your thoughts on wearing this type of outfit while traveling? I am talking about an outfit that includes hiking pants, khaki nylon button-down hiking shirt, bucket hat or wide brimmed hat. I love wearing this when I go hiking in some new jungle or mountain. But I have been called out for it (in a friendly way). I know it's a tourist thing, and it seems like locals never wear special clothes when on some trail. What do you think? Is it cringy?"
