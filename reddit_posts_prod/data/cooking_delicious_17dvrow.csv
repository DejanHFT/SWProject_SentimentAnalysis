I want to repurpose unappetizing but delicious leftovers.,-WhoWasOnceDelight,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/17dvrow/i_want_to_repurpose_unappetizing_but_delicious/,10,3,"I've been trying to reduce food waste, I had some apples and a sweet potato that were on their very last legs last week, so I cut them into large-ish chunks and roasted them until they were caramel-y sweet. They were (and are) very good. 

It was probably never an attractive dish, but time and refrigeration have not been kind to it, and while I know in my head that its good, I don't want to eat it when I look at it. The butter (which will melt, I know) is congealed, and both the potato and apple chunks still have the skin on. Leftover vegetables in tupperware were sort of a horror to me in childhood, and I apparently haven't gotten over that. 

I am wondering if I can run the leftovers through a food processor and mix them with (something?) to make small cakes I could fry. Does this seem feasible? If not, do you have any other suggestions? (Please don't suggest just heating and eating. I want to take these as part of my work lunches this week, and I do not have the moral fiber to eat food that doesn't look good over the cookies, cakes, granola bars and etc that are readily available in the work rooms and other friends desks. To say nothing of door dash.)"
