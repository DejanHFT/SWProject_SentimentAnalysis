Why internet critique became this ?,alboxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/g4im5e/why_internet_critique_became_this/,23,2,"I remember a time when ""obnoxious guy nitpicks about a movie plot in depth and then asks you to subscribe to his channel"" was CLEARLY meant as a joke, in your opinion when did this became a way for countless video channels to honestly critic movies and why ? Do they really believe what they’re saying about plotholes, continuity errors and such ?

EDIT : After seeing the first comments I think I have to clearly state my issue here, it’s not the negativity, I know the Internet loves hot takes, what really pisses me off is how it warped what film criticism really is about for a lot of people."
