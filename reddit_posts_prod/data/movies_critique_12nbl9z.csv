Looking for explicitly communist films.,Better-Raspberry-901,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/12nbl9z/looking_for_explicitly_communist_films/,55,8,"The problem with vaguely anti-capitalist films is that the message is just a surface level take on capitalism  a ""rich bad"" movie that doesn't effectively show class struggle, but makes the villain rich, and rather than express issues of exploitation within society, it often makes it a critique of greed. Of individual cartoonishly bad actors, rather than articulating issues of the owning class as a whole in our society. 

When aspects of capitalism being critiqued are separated from the subject of labor or class, you get empty movies about consumerism like ""Fight Club"" that express anger by the ""middle class"" against consumer society, but don't propose a solution don't propose a future, and so it has a semi-reactionary tone that can be co-opted by reactionaries and fascists to express their disgust not how consumer culture alienates labor or people in general, but specifically how it alienates men who bought into the patriarchal rhetoric of the system. 


I'm looking for a film that doesn't fall into the trap of individualizing the issues of class, or relegating exploitation to individual bad actors, or another empty statement on consumerism that draws in the wrong crowd."
