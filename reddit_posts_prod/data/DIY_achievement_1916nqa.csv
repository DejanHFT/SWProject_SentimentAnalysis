Bifold closet door help,TandoSanjo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1916nqa,1,1,"I have several closets in a new (to me) house that I uninstalled sliding doors from to switch to bifold doors. The problem is that the closets door frames are slightly different sizes, and seem to be under the standard 48” size, only ones I’m seeing at 47” width are astronomical in price. It’s an older house so there’s some slight variation from settling, etc. Wondering if I will have to reframe the doors to fit standard sizes, or I can build simple panel doors custom to fit the 5 closets frames as they are now. Either of those two options seem way cheaper than buying ones that already fit. Any input is greatly appreciated. Height measurements are accounting for the trim piece at the top that I’ll pop out eventually, those were to hide the rails. 

Closet sizes:
2 - 47” x 81”
47.5” x 81”
47 x 80.5”
35” x 81”"
