""The Basel University Library has - in collaboration with the WiR Micha Rieser - completed the upload of a total of 557 digitized maps, ranging from the 16th until the end of the 18th century and available as .tif files. Most of the uploaded maps are still uncategorized - we would greatly appreciate your help with categorizing them.""

Edit: first post and I f'd up the title...

Edit2: I told Miss Schwendener (u/BaselUniLibrary) who worked on the project about this post. She'll gladly answer your questions."
