How to fix a wooden batten to a concrete wall perfectly vertical,t3chnicc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/12o4qac/how_to_fix_a_wooden_batten_to_a_concrete_wall/,6,76," Hello all,

I  have an small corner of open space behind my kitchen fridge and I want  to make a simple closet / wardrobe with one door with hinges mounted on  the wall. The space is around 40 cm width, 60 cm depth (16 by 24  inches). Total height is 250 cm (98 inches). Here's a picture from  Fusion360 to better show the space.

My  idea is to mount a vertical wooden batten (\~7x5 cm cross section, 3 by 2  inches) directly to the concrete wall, to which I would mount the  hinges for the doors as well as a cosmetic panel so that the whole  surface will be flush. I would use concealed cabinet hinges.

There  is \~2 cm / 1 inch of room between the door and the fridge to allow for  air circulation (and possibly for opening the door - don't yet have a  finalized idea about that). Inside the closet I would mount shelves for  storage and they would also act as a stopper for the door. I'm planning  to have \~3 doors across the full height of the closet.

Onto the questions:

1. Do you see anything overly wrong with my idea?
2. The  wall onto which I would mount the batten is within 0.5 cm of being  straight and vertical - if I mount the batten onto it, it won't be  perfectly straight, but I would need it to be as straight and vertical  as possible to mount the hinges. Here I'm thinking about three options:
   1. Use spacers between the batten and the wall to make the batten as vertical as possible
   2. Glue the batten to the wall using mounting adhesive and once it dries bolt it to the wall
   3. Bolt the batten to the wall and then use spacers under the hinges to fix any unevenness
3. I  am slightly worried about the wood bending once installed, but I'm  hoping that the fact it will be bolted to the wall in multiple places  that shouldn't be a big issue?
4. Which type of wood would you use for this? Spruce is easily accessible but I'm worried it's not stable enough.

Thank you all in advance!"
