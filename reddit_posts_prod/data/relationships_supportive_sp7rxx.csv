My best friend/PhD advisor (M 40) is not as supportive as I expected. Do I have high expectations? Am I being harsh?,Fatema_360,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/sp7rxx/my_best_friendphd_advisor_m_40_is_not_as/,21,0,"My friend male (40 years) is also my supervisor. I am a 32 years old female. We have a complicated relationship. However, he is my best friend. So naturally I chose him as my supervisor. I am now in my fourth year, and due to some personal issues I am yet to complete and am lagging behind. In these four years he hasn't read a single paragraph I have written. It has been months and I am asking his help to approve my models. He just makes excuses after excuses. He says he has burnout from work. But I have stood with him and supported him all the time. I literally write his emails for him and prepare his reports. But he just doesn't give me the time of day. I get angry and tell him how I feel all the time. He says I am crazy and an idiot for not believing he wants to help me. I think this is gaslighting. Is it? 

He is my best friend and I don't want to be harsh. But today was the last straw and I told him not to text or call me. I don't want to listen to more excuses like he is stressed, he is sad or burned out.

Please advise on how to move forward. Do I talk to him or just ignore him.

He always makes me feel guilty for not understanding his stress. He makes me feel like shit and I apologize.

tl;dr: My best friend who is my supervisor is not supportive enough. I thought he would help me like I always help him. I spend hours and hours doing his work. When I confront him, he always makes me feel like shit."
