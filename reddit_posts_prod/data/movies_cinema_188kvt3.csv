I have a cinema at my disposal. What film should I show for my birthday?,kurlish,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/188kvt3/i_have_a_cinema_at_my_disposal_what_film_should_i/,1153,436,"For the last two years I've renting a cinema for my birthday, to show a film that I like or that I think is important. So far I've shown Mad Max Fur~~r~~y Road (the black and white version, because I'm a hipster), and Alien 1. What could I show this year? At the moment I'm hesitating between
- the thing
- 12 monkeys
- ?

The film still has to be relatively accessible / not too divisive (some of my friends aren't particularly interested in anything other than Mavel or easy comedies).

If you have an idea for a film that needs to be seen in the cinema, I'm open to suggestions.

(Oh yes, the cinema forbids showing a film that is currently showing, or that is pornographic)

Edit : oops, I made a mistake between ""Fury/Furry"". So I searched for Mad Max **Furry** road, and the internet is full of surprises !

You've suggested lots of great films, I'm going to edit my list above with some films! (Although I'm surprised that no one has suggested 2001: A Space Odyssey)"
