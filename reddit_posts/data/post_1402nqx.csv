"Does Electricity get stuck in ""False Peaks"" while looking for the path of least resistance?",Ilikebreadalot_doyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1402nqx/does_electricity_get_stuck_in_false_peaks_while/,9,20,"First time posting on this sub, don't go to hard on me if I do something wrong please!  


I was thinking about this while looking at a lightning strike that curved quite weirdly, and struck something that really didn't seem like the most optimal point. I had never really thought to look deeper into how it, and the whole ""path of least resistance"" thing worked and accepted that statement at face value. While thinking about how it would work, I tried to picture the below experiment in my head, but couldn't quite make sense of it. I don't have the means to actually do it myself, but I'm still burningly curious and google has not helped.  


Two long rods of different conductive materials are connected in the middle of their length by a strip of a third conductive material. One of the two rods is made of a material with ""medium"" conductivity, while the other is substantially more conductive. The strip in the middle is still conductive but is much poorer at it than either of the other two. Attached to the ""medium"" conductivity rod is a source of electricity. For instance a Car Battery.   


How would electricity flow in this situation? Would it follow the ""medium"" rod to it's end, ignoring the bridge over? Personally I am not sure if it would be able to realize that there is a potentially ""better"" path for it on the other side of this obstacle, obviously since there is no intelligence to it. But would it do so if the other side is ""worth it"" anyways? Or would it spread throughout the entire device like a liquid through a series of tubes, only being slowed down not stopped entirely by the resistive bridge?  


If it does flow only or primarily down the ""worse"" path because a seemingly terrible obstacle is all it can ""see"", the situation would remind me of the False Peak concept, which I primarily know from exposure to Ai Learning, or in the context of trying to find the highest point in a given map.  


Thank you in advance for your answers, I hope I was not just spouting easily explained nonsense."
