Tender tofu 200g，
Tomato 2，
Egg 1，
green onion，
garlic

Seasoning:
 Chinese soy sauce, oyster sauce, salt，sugar

cooking Steps：
Boil a pot of water.
Cut a cross with a knife at the top of the tomato and cook for a short time (the purpose of this step is to peel the skin off the tomato easily), then take out the skin and cut it into small pieces (I personally recommend that you cut it into four pieces and then cut each piece into three or four pieces).
Chop the garlic.

Pan burning oil, pour in the minced garlic stir-fry over low heat until there is garlic flavor, add the cut tomato blocks, stir-fry over low heat, so that the water release , when the tomatoes are very soft, add 500ml of water (the amount of water can be mastered by yourself, the water if you add more than a little more cooking can be done), stirring after the water is open, and then cut the blocks of tofu and add tofu in ,  add an egg in and whisk it, do not care about the shape of Tofu. Next pour in soy sauce, oyster sauce, salt, sugar and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes, this process if you think it's too thick to add water, think too thin to cook for a while, anyway, the last with a spoon to eat.
Add chopped green onion after cooking, stir and start eating.

Regarding the amount of seasoning, at least one spoon of soy sauce, one spoon of oyster sauce, salt and sugar, you can put less and then taste a few times to adjust to your satisfaction.

I hope you will try it, if you like tofu and you have soy sauce and oyster sauce at home, this is a dish that you can learn to make with almost no failures."
