How to connect a basin with water tubes like that,captainnoyaux,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/15cwozm/how_to_connect_a_basin_with_water_tubes_like_that/,4,1,"I have a tube similar to this one but without holes and I was wondering how I could achieve the connection you can see at 7 seconds. What kind of utilities should I buy ? Where ?

I have a 25 mm water pipes and 32 (or 38) mm tubes.   
I'm lost to where I should start, maybe contact a swimming pool maker ?  
Thanks for your help :)
