Are cinemas/movie theaters dying?,Alex_Vlad_Eastern_1,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/zoj75h/are_cinemasmovie_theaters_dying/,136,8,"So like are people still going to see movie. Of course they do. But I see that movies are making lesssss money than they used to before the pandemik. And it's strange cause some movies now and then are making a lot of money. But I see franchises like MARVEL , DCEU ,and Avatar making significantly less money than last year. And it's strange cause even forgettable movies like Ant Man and the Wasp and Jumanji 2017-2019 that made a tooon of money. So what happened? The pandemic is almost done and movies like No Way Home and Top Gun 2 that made Bank, but tah's about all the stuff that made lots of money (Also Minions, Dominion, and Dr Strange I guess)"
