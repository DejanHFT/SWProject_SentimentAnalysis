"Mother daughter trip ideas (20ish and 50ish, active and adventurous)",Excellent_Use4261,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16adkmk/mother_daughter_trip_ideas_20ish_and_50ish_active/,3,1,"Hi!

As the title suggests, my mom (mid 50s) and I (mid 20s) are planning a mother daughter trip and I would love suggestions for something that might fit our interests / would love to hear about any particularly great mother--daughter trips others have taken! TYIA!

**Dates:** \~10 days in March 2023

**Airport departure options:** SFO or OAK

**Budget:** Likely \~$3000-4000pp, not on a super tight budget but my mom is frugal by nature and I'd love to not spend a fortune

**Info / preferences**: 

* My mom and I are both very active people and like exploring off the beaten path places. We are both totally fine walking a bunch, enjoy hiking, and really enjoy yoga. (We contemplated a yoga retreat but a lot of them seem very overpriced / potentially problematic.) Our ideal trip would be 2/3 adventure 1/3 relaxation!
* We are not into all-inclusive resorts, similarly we don't enjoy staying in large hotels / super touristy areas - strong preference for smaller bed and breakfasts, small hotels, or houses. Happy to visit touristy attractions that are worth it (e.g. La Sagrada Familia, Buckingham Palace) but would prefer not to only be in touristy areas
* Are leaning towards somewhere tropical, but also open to visiting some countries in Europe
* Want to make sure we would feel safe as two women
* My mom is fluent in Spanish (not a native speaker though)

**Current ideas (first places that came to mind - not definitive):** Belize, Switzerland, London
