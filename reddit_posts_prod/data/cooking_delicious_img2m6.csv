"You've had grilled cheese sandwiches, but have you had grilled meat sandwiches? Lebanese Arayes are flatbreads filled with seasoned meat kofta, then grilled. The result is mind blowingly delicious",ObiEff,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/img2m6/youve_had_grilled_cheese_sandwiches_but_have_you/,202,2453,"After the Koshari recipe, I really wanted to do something simple but delicious to show that not all Middle Eastern recipes require a crazy amount of work. These Arayes or Pita Pockets are so easy to make and pack so much flavor for a recipe that takes all of 20 minutes to put together. 


## What is Arayes
[Arayes](https://imgur.com/a/wf2ekpS) are pockets of Pita bread that are filled with a traditional seasoned meat Kofta filling. [Kofta](https://recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Lamb-Koftas_7.jpg) is common to nearly all Middle Eastern cuisines and it's a mixture of seasoned ground meat (usually lamb or beef, but sometimes chicken or even fish is used). To cook Kofta, the mixture is formed over skewers and then grilled over charcoal or in a pan. In contrast to make Arayes, you fill a Pita bread with the raw kofta mixture, and then grill it bread and all. This results in an amazing texture and flavor combination as the bread chars on the outside, and the meat inside cooks to perfection. As the meat cooks it slowly releases its grilling juices directly into the bread both seasoning and moistening it. Once cooked you can eat them straight away and like most grilled meats, these are amazing straight off of the grill. The combination of super crispy bread and perfectly juicy grilled meat is one you really need to try.

Most Kofta fillings in the Middle East contain Meat, Onions, Garlic and Parsley, the one we'll be making for the Arayes also contains Pomegranate Molasses for an extra layer of flavor. Arayes are considered a Levantine food and it most commonly shows up in Lebanese cuisine, so this one I've put together is a Lebanese recipe. Other Arab countries also have their own versions of stuffed flat breads, most notably is the Egyptian Hawawshi which contains a spicier meat filling. After you've made this traditional recipe, I'd highly recommend making your own custom meat filling, you could easily make a Tex Mex inspired one with lots of cumin and ground beef. 

## Cultural Context
This is one of those dishes that doesn't seem to have an origin story at all and so I thought I would tell you the tidbits I could gleam about this dish. Arayes actually means brides in Arabic, and I literally have no idea why the name is fitting for the dish. They're eaten throughout the Levant (Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Iraq) and because of that, nearly every country in the region lays some sort of claim to having invented the dish. For the most part there are difference in how the Kofta filling is put together in each country. 

## Flavor Profile
The main flavor in the dish is the Grilled meat, and if you are using beef, well it's similar to a burger. The addition of onions and parsley to the meat gives it a herby and slightly sweetened background flavor, which is complemented well by the addition of Boharat and Pomegranate molasses. The pomegranate molasses adds sweetness and sourness to the meat and rounds out the dish. The final flavor that really stands out here is the flavor of the grilled bread. 

In terms of texture you can end up with two different scenarios, if you've purchases [Pita bread that is on the thicker side](https://www.justalittlebitofbacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/homemade-pita-bread-for-submission.jpg), you'll end with a crispy bread exterior and a soft and juicy meat interior. If on the other hand your bread is on the [thinner side](https://www.maureenabood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Pita-bread-3-POST.jpg) (like this lebanese bread), then it tends to soften and steam, and it ends up similar to the wrapper of a steamed dumpling. The addition of onion to the meat mixture helps it tenderize and moisten the meat from within as it cooks, resulting in a satisfyingly soft meat texture.

## Ingredients
5-6 Pita Breads or 6 Lebanese bread  
500g (1lb) Minced Beef (or you can use lamb), get 80% meat : 20% fat, but 70:30 is ideal if you can find it  
30g (1oz) Parsley  
1 Medium brown onions  
1-2 Garlic Cloves  
1 1/2 Tbsp Pomegranate Molasses  
25-50g Beef Fat or 2 Tbsp Olive oil  (this is to increase the fat ratio, leave out if you want)
1 Tsp salt  
1/2 Tsp Baharat (this is a Middle Eastern spice blend, but if you don't have this you can use all spice instead)  
1/4 Tsp Black Pepper  
1/4 Tsp Cayenne or chilli flakes
1/8 Tsp Cinnamon  
2 Tbsp Olive oil for brushing the bread

## Directions
### To make the meat filling:
1. Add your Onion and parsley to a food processor or blender, and process till very finely chopped
2. Crush the garlic cloves and add to a mixing bowl with the meat, onion mixture, pomegranate molasses, beef fat/olive oil, salt, baharat, black pepper, cayenne/chilli flakes and cinnamon. Mix together thoroughly until a uniform mixture forms
3. Cook a small piece of the meat in a pan and taste for seasoning. Adjust if necessary

### To prepare the Arayes:
1. First thing, test if your bread is fresh and you can easily pull the two layers apart, if not then microwave it for 30 seconds until piping hot, alternatively you can heat in a pan flipping occasionally. Don't separate the two layers just yet, you want to keep your bread intact
2. Slice your bread in half (if oval shaped) or into quarters (if circular) and then use a knife to pry both sides of the bread apart, you should open it from the seams where you sliced it and not the outer edge of the bread. Once you've managed to pull the two sides apart, open your bread up until a pocket forms or until you could easily get the filling in there
3. Add a few tablespoons of the meat filling to each pocket and massage it to the edges and back of the bread. For thicker pita aim to have the meat filling about 1cm (1/3in) thick, or 1/2cm (1/6in) thick for the paper thin Lebanese bread. Stuff the bread pieces till you have used up all of your meat mixture
4. Using a brush, or your hands, coat the surface of each stuffed pitta bread with olive oil until liberally oiled

### To cook the Arayes:
1. Preheat a grill pan (or a real grill) on medium high heat and when ready add your Arayes
2. Grill for 4 minutes and then flip once they start to sizzle (thinner bread will take about 3 minutes per side, on a real grill cook using a low heat)
3. Cook for the same amount of time on the other side and then remove from the pan

Prepare a simple sumac chopped parsley and onion salad and serve the Arayes


## Notes and tips

* Kofta is commonly known as Kabob (in the US) and Kebab (in europe), despite Kebab being the name given to grilled pieces of whole meat and not ground meat (ground is always called Kofta). In Turkey the rules regarding naming are also different. 
* If you want to make an approximation to Egyptian Hawawshi, add some more chilli flakes, baharat and two finely diced tomatoes
