Follow the inspiration vs follow through,happy_mushroom22,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/qao9zy/follow_the_inspiration_vs_follow_through/,5,6,"I know a lot of writers struggle with follow through and finishing a project before starting another but that has never been an issue for me. For the last 5-7 years I've consistently worked on a book (on and off of course) and I'm currently in the end fourth of editing before sending out to beta readers. I'm finding myself frustrated with this part of my writing and losing steam, and usually I would taper off until finding more motivation/time but I'm so close I want to finish. BUT, just in the last few weeks I was struck with another book idea (something that doesn't happen often) and I am craving to write the start of this book. I have very limited time and part of me thinks I want to start this because I think I could do a better job with this one than the one I'm working through. I'm frustrated with my current book because I have grown so much as a writer and there's still a lot of work to do. In my mind, it's a good idea to push through the last edits and work on this new book when it's in the hands of betas but it's been a struggle to resist. 

Any thoughts?"
