My ( 34F) boyfriend ( 35M) isn't supportive of my career,Lost-Supermarket6350,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/16uivxf/my_34f_boyfriend_35m_isnt_supportive_of_my_career/,16,1,"Tldr: My business took off beautifully but my boyfriend keeps saying things towards me not knowing what I'm doing. He's also angry that I crossed over to the industry he's in 


I've (34F) been with Neil ( 35M) for 2 years. Initially, he was very okay with our lives being so different. He's an engineer and I was just completing my MBA because I had been working towards new opportunities and saw it fit to go back to college. I own a small new age business that helped pay for my bills. 

Everything was okay until he started bringing up my shop during arguments. He would say I have my head in the clouds and that I'm basically a failure because no one is keeping me in check. I've felt horrible about his criticism and him comparing me to his female colleagues who got their ahit together. 

3 years ago, I got several clients and a great business opportunity coming from a multinational. This is part of my efforts to build my new business and my career. I still have my new age business because I have no reason to close it down as it's still bringing me revenue.

I was recruited as project manager, and was hired via my small new company for a long term consulting agreement. I've been investing in myself ( good quality business attire, certifications, a good car that won't strand me). 

I don't understand Neil. He's very affectionate but has periods of intense criticism towards me. He didn't even congratulate me when I created my corporation. 
I treated him to a nice restaurant for dinner last February. I also wanted to share that some of my colleagues ( 2 of them are from back when I was doing the MBA) invited me to be a partner with them in a new venture. I was barely able to tell Neil that this is a huge project that means a lot for me, my career and will definitely make a difference for years to come. He cut me immediately and said "" you are not gonna do anything"". I didn't care so much for his words as for his facial expression. 

After that, I have not shared anything important with him. 

Fast forward and we got financing and an investor to purchase another company. Neil used to work for that company (way back when he was starting his career) and exploded on me. He says I did it on purpose to piss him off. Then he ranted about my cheap taste as I see no problem buying things I like from discount shops. I ended up crying and he apologized. I don't know what to do. I love him but I'm also guilty of feeling that he's not enough for me. I'm beginning to question him. He had a huge advantage over me, with a split career and a lot more money. In a.few years, he is still critical of me but I don't see him doing anything different with his life. I'd like to address this with him but don't even know how. 

I need advice on discussing this with him. I ignored his nay saying and moved on with my work life. He only criticizes but his behavior towards me does match his reality. I'm very supportive of him and his hobbies, career, family relationships, etc. He's very supportive of everything in my life except my career choices. Please advise. Thanks."
