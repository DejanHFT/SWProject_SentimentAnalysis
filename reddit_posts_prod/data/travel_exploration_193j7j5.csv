7hr layover in Paris. Worth leaving CDG to explore.?,chisel1,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/193j7j5/7hr_layover_in_paris_worth_leaving_cdg_to_explore/,11,0,"Hello All!


Wife and I have a 7hr+ layover in CDG on our way to final destination. 

We would love to perhaps go out and explore some of the main attractions in the city including the louvre, Eiffel, trocadero, arc de Triomphe, La palais, Notre dame, champs elyssee, amongst others. We plan to Uber to Notre dame first then use a lime scooter from there onwards to Eiffel (stopping at various sites along the way). 

• Is this feasible with the time we have.? 
• what is the temperature like during that time of the year?
• What is the current situation in Paris with protests? 
• Any impact to transportation system? 
• how much time do we need to get through customs and security at CDG.?

Any advice or recommendations is highly appreciated."
