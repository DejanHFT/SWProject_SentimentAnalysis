"I(F29) need therapy, infants father(M31) not supportive and getting abusive.",AppropriateSurround9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/be9xzk/if29_need_therapy_infants_fatherm31_not/,14,21,"There's a lot more to this story and so i'm going to let it out here because it's starting to get overwhelming and I need to let it out, sorry it's so long.  I've reached a point where I don't know what the correct thing to do is or if I'm doing the right thing, I feel like i'm getting in to more and more of a fog mentally and it's starting to have a negative impact on my physical well-being.  I haven't been eating as much as I should because I don't feel hungry, which is one of the first signs of stress for me.  I need to get it together since I am currently breastfeeding our 3 month old and need the nutrients and energy.

The baby's father and I had a relationship 3 years ago, after about nine months we ended it.  We struggled to communicate and I constantly felt as though I was doing something wrong and not good enough.  It reached a point where he would just use me for sex and company it seemed.  9 months later we reconnected, he claimed to have made significant breakthroughs with himself and had thought about me constantly and wanted to be with me.  I was extremely hesitant, and after being in therapy after the relationship, was just beginning to recognize and admit that I had an anxious attachment style and issues from my past that I needed to work through.  I was weary of starting something with people who seemed to have avoidant personalities such as had been identified for him.

We started dating again, I ended up asking him to be my boyfriend a couple of months in and things were going okay.  I stayed in therapy and was doing well.  Fast forward a few months, we started having trouble communicating again.  I found out I was pregnant and after periods of arguments that included him telling me to get an abortion I kept the baby.  He suggested couples counseling after things had settled and we went but things progressively got worse.  I take responsibility for following him and for letting my anxiety get the best of me during conflict.  He would walk away, stonewall me, be condescending, kick me out of his house, and I would pursue him even more.  He broke up with me two days after I moved in to his house and the arguing got worse and progressed physically during the last months of my pregnancy.  We slept in separate rooms, and it was really lonely.  I spent a lot of the time crying or just feeling down in general.  I had stopped my own therapy to focus on couples counseling.  I had also been accepted in to a social work graduate program during this time, and am employed full time at a therapy office, I  was trying to juggle all of the ""therapy"" so I felt that the couples counseling took priority.

We had the baby, she's the most amazing thing that ever happened in my entire experience and existence.  Since then, I'm still in school, I don't want to stop because I want to be done while she's still little so that I can provide for her.  I work full time, and I still live with her father although we're not together.  We recently messed around and he told me the next day after I expressed my feelings of wanting to be together that it was a mistake and a moment of weakness on his part.  My insurance doesn't cover my therapy so I will have to pay out of pocket, approximately $500-$600 a month.  I want to stay with my previous therapist since she knows my background and financially it is more feasible so I don't have to spend sessions retelling things.  I pay her father rent ($800), which I didn't think was fair at first since he charged his last roommate less due to special circumstances, and asked if he could help me out for 3 months and allow me to pay him $200 less.  He said no and that I was being manipulative and that it was all about money for me.  He didn't have to pay any of the hospital bills and he doesn't have to pay for her insurance.  As far as childcare we split the cost in half and my parents watch the baby for $500 a month, which half is being put aside in to an account for the baby to be given to her when she's older.

Our relationship has gotten progressively worse as roommates.  After an argument where he got up and pushed in to me while I held the baby, he strangled me and threw me to the floor.  The last incident happened last night because I was trying to go to sleep and didn't want him to come in to my room and wake the baby up because he smelled like cigar smoke and wanted to kiss her.  He has a key to my room and pushed his way in, as I was trying to hold the door closed I tried pushing him out and he bit my hand leaving me deep indentations and a bruise.

I think I know what to do but my mind is in a fog, I can't recognize if what I am doing or asking for is manipulative or if I'm asking for something unreasonable.  I need to talk to someone, I feel like i'm doing the best I can and just need a bit of a break.  I get that he doesn't owe me anything but I really need help.

TL;DR Currently working full time, in a graduate program full time, and a new parent to a 3 month old while living with ex boyfriend who is getting abusive.  I feel as though I need to start going to therapy again but I can't afford it.  I asked my ex if I could pay him $200 less in rent and he said no and called me manipulative."
