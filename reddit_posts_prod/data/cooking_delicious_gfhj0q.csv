An oven roasted Onion is one of the most simple yet delicious things you could cook,lomosaltadomo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/gfhj0q/an_oven_roasted_onion_is_one_of_the_most_simple/,163,1333,"I had some leftover onion which I didn't know what to do with.  I disassembled it into individual rings.  Put them on a pan and spaced them out.  Drizzled oil on the onions and put some salt and pepper.  Then I put it in the oven at 400F for 15-20 minutes (flipping once in the middle) and it's literally the most amazing simple dish I have ever created.  The caramelized brown bits are heavenly.

If you are unsure which onion to buy at the supermarket, get a yellow onion but I am sure all onion  types will work well!"
