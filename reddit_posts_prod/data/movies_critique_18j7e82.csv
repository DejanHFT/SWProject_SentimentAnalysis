A cool cinematic experiment?,HouseOfYass,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18j7e82/a_cool_cinematic_experiment/,9,0,"I am probably the only person the world that actually admires Psycho 1998 for what it is. Not to critique the movie, but I like the idea of taking an old classic movie and updating it for a younger audience. I like it because it attempts to answer the  question of how well classic movies stand up with modern audiences. To me, Psycho 1998 only underscores how amazing the 1960 classic is. And if you're going to remake a movie we all love, isn't the most respectful thing to do a shot-by-shot remake? Anyway, I love Psycho 1998 as a daring experiment.

That got me thinking about how cool it would be if two directors were given the same script, and were tasked with making their movie at the same time. Of course, the point is that they'd make their movies completely independent of the other. You'd get these two visions of the exact same written source. Imagine a situation in which both Kubrick and Spielberg are given a script of The Shining and asked to adapt the script. It's an experiment that could give great insight into the movie making process and the creative process.

I wonder whether you guys think this is an interesting idea."
