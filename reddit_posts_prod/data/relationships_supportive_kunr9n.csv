Person (F21) in my friend group is supportive of everyone in the group except me (M22).,Hot_Property_9986,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/kunr9n/person_f21_in_my_friend_group_is_supportive_of/,9,1,"Hi, so to get things straight I'm going to be a bit vague as to not get doxxed as I think friends of mine use Reddit.

I'm apart of a really supportive friend group, where we actively talk with one another and hang with one another. We're pretty close knit and talk about everything with one another. Now the thing is there's one person in the friend group who hypes up others, talks actively with others in the group. Now with me, they approach me with seemingly critical of everything I do, and critiquing and criticizing my behaviors whereas that is not done to anyone else in the friend group publicly.

I've done nothing to offend this person and am an active support of everyone in the group and actively continue to be. I know that this is only my perspective, and that not everyone in the group may feel like that. But everyone in the group is friendly towards me except that 1 person. She is friendly to everyone except me and I'm not sure why. I don't badmouth her or anyone either...I'm not a perfect person or anything, but I'm just so confused as to why she's so blunt and mean to me whereas she is actually supportive to others. I get that I won't vibe with everyone in the world, but it's just concerning as this is my main friend group and I would hate for them to possibly badmouth me behind my back and get the group to leave me altogether.

What do you recommend me do? I want to approach them directly and ask why they are really negative towards me and if we could possibly get things straightened out but they are very unapproachable.

TL;DR - Person in my core friend group is mean to me and I'm not sure why."
