lack of inspiration,cahibi6640,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/17t79m6/lack_of_inspiration/,7,1,"i was enrolled into an english creative writing contest in my school (i don't live in an english-speaking country), and i have to write a short story OR essay about whatever topic i want. problem is i have NO IDEA what to write about - i would like to submit a short story, but at this point i think i'll just go with whatever comes at me first. how does one find inspiration? i'm currently in really deep shit since i should have submitted at least a basic idea a few days ago"
