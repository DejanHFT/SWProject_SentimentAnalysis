"I don't mean to sound rude, but are there too many ""5k achievement"" posts?",mOnion,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/v4h5u/i_dont_mean_to_sound_rude_but_are_there_too_many/,22,0,"I feel like I've been seeing **so** many of these lately and they clog up my fitness feed. I would hate to shit on people's achievements, but as far as fitness goals are concerned a 5k isn't exactly a staggering mark of progress. It's 3.1 miles. Anybody on the heavier side could easily *finish* this race after running for a month, and anyone in decent shape could finish around 25 minutes (~8 min miles) after 3 or 4 months of training. it just seems strange to heavily congratulate these people for something which really isn't all that impressive. I mean I'm 135 lbs and just rep'd 200 on power clean after working out for almost a year, but I wouldn't post about it because it pales in comparison to other posts because A) I haven't had significant personal weight gain and B) 200 on clean is garb. Once I hit my own weight goals, or reach some lifting progress that's athletically relevant, then I may post to share my success. 

Am I being too harsh? I just don't believe in empty congratulations, so I just can't bring myself to encourage someone who just posted about running a 5k in 45 minutes when really that's pretty pathetic. Why not let those posts fall to the ground so they realize that they need to work harder actually set some real goals for themselves? 

Additionally, running is not a difficult thing to do, I know this as a cross country runner. You do not need to have any kind of athletic ability to be able to run, you just run. I've seen some of the most pathetic fucking bookworm nerds with no shred of athlete in them whatsoever run sub 15min 5k's, and it's because they never missed practice, and never gave up. 

half marathons and fulls are another story, but 5k's? really? "
