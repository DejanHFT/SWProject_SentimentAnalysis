Exploring at home or abroad?,Wavesoftheocean,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/qnvn2o/exploring_at_home_or_abroad/,19,7,"I have been considering planning out my next travel adventure and I am looking for some input. I have several places on my “bucket list” closer to my home as well as abroad. The places I am interested in going to closer to home are Churchill, Canada, Banff, PEI, and/or Alaska. As for abroad I am looking into Australia, UK, France, Italy, Austria, Germany, or The Netherlands. Part of my dilemma is feeling like if I haven’t explored my own continent, why should I go abroad? Anyone out there have similar feelings? Open to any thoughts, feedback, or suggestions! Thanks!"
