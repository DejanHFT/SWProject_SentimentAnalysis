How is the American Revolutionary War taught in Great Britain schools/textbooks?,Hammer_ATL,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/gz0hv6/how_is_the_american_revolutionary_war_taught_in/,63,18,"Iâ€™ve long had this question as someone that was born, grew up, and still lives in the US. Especially in the southern US, the Revolution is sometimes talked as an almost holy, biblical, God-ordained event which quite frankly bothers me. 

So with that in mind, what is the perception of colonial America and the Revolution from GB? (And insight from other European countries that played a role on either side of the war would also be helpful.)"
