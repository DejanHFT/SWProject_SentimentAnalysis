Archer Push Ups are a great exercise for your chest, triceps and your deltoids, so i made a video tutorial for them. They are quite easy to learn, if you watch out for a few form cues, so i hope you enjoy it.

If you don't want to watch the video, i'll also include an explantion below.

* For the archer push ups, **[you start in a plank position](http://imgur.com/ByQ4CDi)** and externally rotate your arms, while keeping them about double-shoulder width apart.

* **[Hand positioning in the upper part.](http://imgur.com/0EbN9yv)**

* Now you lean to one side, while keeping the other arm completely straight. **[The bottom position should look like this](http://imgur.com/VvD1kxu)** While you do so, internally rotate your arm and keep your elbow close to your body.

* Now you press up into the starting position, while keeping the elbow of the straight arm completely straight. Repeat to the other side.

* Form cues: You need to keep your straight arm completely straight at all times, or you're doing a biceps exercise - which isn't the goal of the archer push up. You want to train your chest, triceps and your deltoids - and this is best achieved by having your elbow straight. This way, your biceps and brachialis aren't activated as much. This also makes the exercise much harder!

* A good way to build up to archer push ups is, by starting weighted push ups and work up to 20%-30% of added bodyweight. Once you are able to do 2-3 reps with that weight added, you'll find negative archers easily achievable, and real archer push ups aren't far away.

I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and find it helpful to achieve this new cool skill. :) I've got a few questions aswell, to start a discussion:

* If you can already do them, what progression did you use to learn archer push ups?

* Have you tried archers before and failed to keep your arm straight? What was the reason?
