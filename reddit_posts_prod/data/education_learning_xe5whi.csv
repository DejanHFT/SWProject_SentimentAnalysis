Article about sentence syntax understanding that was a breakthrough for K12 language learning?,spiffiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/xe5whi/article_about_sentence_syntax_understanding_that/,6,8,"Many years ago, probably 15+, I read an article about an educator who was brought in to help a struggling school, I think it was in the northeastern US, and she had a breakthrough discovery that the reason many students struggled is that they didn't really comprehend certain moderately complex sentence structures, and that by helping those students understand what is meant by those constructions, they significantly improved the kids outcomes. I seem to recall that the syntax in question was something like sentences that begin by stating one thing, and then have a ""…but…"" or ""…however…"" clause that contrasts with the first clause and rebuts or nuances it. I think the kids that were struggling didn't quite know what was being said by this kind of sentence that almost seems (from a very naïve perspective) to disagree with itself.

Ever since then, whenever I think about that, I go looking to try to find out who that was and what school it was and what became of that insight, but I've never been able to find the original article I read, or anything else about that educator or school or breakthrough insight.

I don't care if I find whatever the original article was, or not. I'd just like to find more information about that educator and her discovery and how things worked out.

Does this ring any bells for anyone? Any ideas what I might be half-recalling here?"
