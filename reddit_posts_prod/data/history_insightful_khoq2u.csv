"Why is it generally taught that the 2nd World War was from 1940 to 1945, and not from 1939?",Pumaranger,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/khoq2u/why_is_it_generally_taught_that_the_2nd_world_war/,27,0,"Why is it generally taught that the 2nd World War was from 1940 to 1945, and not from 1939? Did something significant happen in 1940 that was more important than Hitler announcing war in 1939 / the invasion in Poland? Thank you for any insights."
