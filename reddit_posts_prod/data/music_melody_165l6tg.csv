Can't write decent sounding melodies,cyrusng7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/165l6tg/cant_write_decent_sounding_melodies/,1,0,"This is my first time I'm writing a song, and in my opinion, I think I'm doing fairly well. Most of the other parts of the song are coming along decently, but I can't seem to make a good sounding melody. The way I've been trying is to repeatedly play the scale of the key of my song on the piano until something pops into my mind. But every time something pops into my head and I put it down into my notation app, when I play it back it sounds extremely simple, lame and childish. At times sounding like something that would be a nursery rhyme. Anyone can tell me what I'm doing wrong and what I should do?"
