The relative unimportance of belief and lack thereof,iquizzle,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/13hnl3/the_relative_unimportance_of_belief_and_lack/,25,14,"When someone says ""I believe this"" or ""I don't believe that"", haven't they already presupposed that there may be exception to their claim which they choose to discount without adequate reason? Is it possible to simply accept that *what is will be* without assigning the value of belief? Is the only purpose of belief to establish ethics and to arbitrarily assign ourselves value above mechanized creatures which do not contemplate their existence?

A belief has no power over what *is*. If this is true, then how does one escape nihilism?

*edit -- I apologize in advance if this is actually a trivial consideration for many of you. I'm a physicist and it's something I've struggled with for a while when I try to find purpose in my job. Regardless of how far I go to try to factually understand the world, it ends in belief (or similarly further hypothesis). I can't escape the conclusion that understanding is impossible, only a utilitarian/ethical objective of what is useful."
