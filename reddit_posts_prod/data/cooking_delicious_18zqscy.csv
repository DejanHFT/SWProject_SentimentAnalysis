My joy is making the most delicious things for my friends.,chewie8291,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/18zqscy/my_joy_is_making_the_most_delicious_things_for_my/,7,12,I love cooking for those I love.  I try new things every time I make an old recipe. Years of perfection to get things right.  And I enjoy being humble.  But yes I secretly inside love all the compliments.  Does anyone else feel like this?
