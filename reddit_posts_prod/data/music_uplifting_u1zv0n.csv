What’s the happiest song you’ve ever heard?,rhythmicfan14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/u1zv0n/whats_the_happiest_song_youve_ever_heard/,6070,7319,"I’ve seen this question asked a lot but for sad songs so I decided to make a thread for happy songs and by happy I don’t necessarily mean songs with happy lyrics anything that makes you happy or uplifts your mood is fine.

Edit : Thank you to everyone for your suggestions and awards. I’m super grateful.I’m making a playlist of the songs. I’ve added more than a hundred of them and I’m still adding. Here’s the link for anyone interested:

Edit 2 : So many of you guys asked for a Spotify playlist. I don’t have Spotify but a few people in comments made a playlist of the songs mentioned in this thread. Since I can’t pin a comment send me a dm and I will send you the link to one of the playlists."
