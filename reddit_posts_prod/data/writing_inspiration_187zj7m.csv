Is drawing inspiration from another piece of work wrong to do?,hella_bella_16,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/187zj7m/is_drawing_inspiration_from_another_piece_of_work/,7,7,"Not sure where to post this but I’m a senior in highschool who is currently in a literature course. Because we are approaching the end of the semester, my teacher offered an extra credit opportunity where we may either write a short story or a poem. If either work is good enough, we could potentially be featured in our school’s magazine which I think is pretty cool. 

I had the idea of centering my short story around how the children of immigrants have the power to either break generational trauma or contribute to its continuation, and I thought of a show I have watched. The Haunting of Hill House on Netflix (SPOILERS AHEAD - amazing show btw please go watch) has a character that is essentially haunted by her own death; she sees a figure all the time when she’s a child and we later find out that she is the figure itself. I thought this idea was really fascinating when I originally watched the show and I connected it to my prompt idea. I want to write about how the narrator sees the ghosts of different family members all throughout their life (while highlighting the relationship they have with their parents) only to reveal at the end that they are haunted by their family’s generational trauma. I’d like to have them observe their childhood self staring back at them and not being able to differentiate the difference between them and deceased family members. But, I worry this might be too copy and paste/unoriginal. Thoughts ?"
