"19,080.00 YTL for a creative cloud subscription! I am genuinely confused!",rowamme,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/17fpm82/1908000_ytl_for_a_creative_cloud_subscription_i/,10,0,"Given that I live in a country where Adobe services are unavailable, I researched my options and found out that Turkey is the best available price, and given everyone's experience, changing the region before pursuing works just fine, I took the extra mile and used a turkey VPN, created a new account and subscribed for an Individual yearly plan with a monthly pay schedule, before purchasing I got a price of around 6.6 USD per month, ""Super convenient"" and as soon as I bought the plan I got charged ""19,080.00 YTL"".

Here's why this is confusing, I know that the Turkish Lira's short form is ""TRY"" so what does YTL mean? I googled it and I found that it stands for Turkish Lira as well, in this case, why would Adobe charge me around 670 USD given that my plan is monthly and that the plans offered for Turkey are significantly less than that?

Please I need your help in understanding this, and what steps should I take if that is true."
