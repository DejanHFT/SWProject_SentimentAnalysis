[TOMT] Little Things - Adrian Berenguer (original Melodie),JihaaaWallstreet,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/xvpo6o/tomt_little_things_adrian_berenguer_original/,17,25,"My god, for the last 3 hours I'm clicking through classical music to try to find the origin.

Backstory: I heard the song above (little things) and directly thought ""ahh yes.. very well known popular classical melody, I know that.. very old.. from.. ahhh.."" and then I realized the song is just one year old. It can't be.. It feels like I have heard the songs 100 times in my live. 

Can you please tell me that there is a very similar classic song which exists for ages, that I can finally rest and relax again? This is freaking me out."
