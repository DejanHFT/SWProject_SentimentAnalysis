Prettiest small towns to explore?,jaymejoshi,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/148gkfg/prettiest_small_towns_to_explore/,33,24,"Travelling around Washington state and wanting to discover some new small towns. Would prefer to stick to the Washington, Oregon, Northern California area. I love the tiny cozy woodsy side towns I usually find along the path of my roadtrips (like Tahoe City, Tahoma and Truckee in California) But I also really enjoyed my recent stays at Leavenworth, Poulsbo and Port Townsend in Washington just from the sheer beauty of them alone. So anything along those lines really works for me.

(Doesn't even necessarily have to be a town, I've stopped on the side of roads for stuff like adorable little diners and themed general stores before too, just looking for any place that's pretty nestled somewhere beautiful)

If anyone knows of any little secret spots to discover I would really appreciate hearing about it to learn more!"
