I lead innovation efforts at IBM, directing research strategies in areas including AI, cloud, quantum computing, and exploratory science. Under my leadership IBM became the first company in the world to build programmable quantum computers and make them universally available through the cloud. 

I recently was appointed a member of the National Science Board, and as an advocate of collaborative research models, I also co-chair the COVID-19 High-Performance Computing Consortium, which provides access to the world's most powerful high-performance computing resources in support of COVID-19 research.

IBM is simultaneously creating the supercomputers of tomorrow: quantum computers. Ask me anything about the next great frontier of computing: quantum!
