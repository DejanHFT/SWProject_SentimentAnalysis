How can I motivate my wife to get fit?,Fitz227,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1j1q1d/how_can_i_motivate_my_wife_to_get_fit/,71,15,"Help me r/fitness, you're my only hope. 

First of all, I love my wife, and I am not exactly an Ironman myself (36, 5'7"", 175), but I exercise every day and I try to watch what I eat so that I don't get (too) overweight. We have a 2 year old and since she was born, my wife has steadily gotten bigger and bigger. She is now 31 and around 200 lbs at 5'7"", and growing. We bought an elliptical which I use daily, but she doesn't. She used to do it in the mornings, but the 2 year old's lousy sleeping habits make it so that she is exhausted in the morning and doesn't want to work out. 

I had what I thought was a really good heart to heart with her about how I am starting to resent her and feel hostile toward her because of her size. She (obviously) was very hurt by this conversation despite the fact that I tried my hardest to be as nice as possible and to let her know that I love her and will no matter what, but that I want her to get into shape so that we can have another kid and so that i will be more attracted to her naked body.

She has a thyroid issue for which she has recently started taking medication, and I think she thinks those are miracle pills that will have her back at her ideal weight without any diet or exercise. Me bringing up her weight always leads to tears. 

The part that is killing me is that she still eats like a college freshman. She won't eat fish or anything that she is not comfortable with including most vegetables. Dessert every night, despite the fact that I always pass and throw away cookies and ice cream every chance I get. 

I am at my wits end. Please help me. How can I get her to care about herself so that she gets in shape again? I vacillate between resenting her and feeling guilty about resenting her. I just want her to try."
