>***Critics Consensus:- It: Chapter Two proves bigger doesn't always mean scarier for horror sequels, but a fine cast and faithful approach to the source material keep this follow-up afloat.***

>*When it comes down to it, It Chapter Two just isn't all that scary.*

[AV Club](https://film.avclub.com/despite-a-scene-stealing-turn-from-bill-hader-it-chapt-1837795751?_ga=2.153640952.1331389497.1567527362-1931873080.1479230711)

>*Really, the main problem with Chapter Two is that it goes on, and on, for so very long.*

[Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movie-reviews/2019/09/03/it-chapter-two-review/)

>*It Chapter Two isn't better than Chapter One. It's certainly not scarier. Here's the thing, though: when it counts, it's every bit as thrilling.* 

[London Evening Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/film/it-chapter-two-film-review-a4228136.html)

>*It is just so pointlessly long: approaching three hours, with our heroes finally beginning to assume a glassy-eyed solemnity like Hogwarts graduates or the Fellowship of the Ring.*

[Gaurdian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/03/it-chapter-two-review-stephen-king-bill-skarsgard-andy-muschietti?CMP=share_btn_tw)

>*IT Chapter Two isn't as refined as the first, but it's still an excellent ensemble piece, oozing with heart and packed with extremely well-crafted set pieces. Muschietti weaves the young and adult Losers together well, giving the sequel an epic feel.*

[Collider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB5hRvQPWeQ)

>*Although marred by pacing issues and some shoddy CGI, It Chapter Two still has enough creepy set-pieces and solid performances to bring the saga to an effective, albeit formulaic, con.*

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/03/it-chapter-2-review)

>*An elaborate fun-house horror movie that springs pop-up gimmicks and boogie-boogie scares steadily enough to excuse its been-there story and self-important 169-minute running time.*

[Variety](https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/it-chapter-two-review-1203321205/)

>*It is glorious to see this stuff envisioned on such a huge and self-assured scale, a joy to have a film of this size trading in this sort of genre carnage with such uncompromising and unapologetic style.*

[Empire Online](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/it-chapter-two/)

>*Andy Muschietti did a great job of not only staying faithful to the source material, but also adding fresh spins and ideas to this adaptation of a Stephen King classic. If you're a fan of the first movie (like me), you'll love this sequel.*

[Geeks of Color](https://geeksofcolor.co/2019/09/03/it-chapter-2-lives-up-to-the-hype-of-its-predecessor-review/)

>*For all of Muschietti’s visual flourishes and with the greatly talented Bill Skarsgard again delivering a madcap, disturbingly effective, all-in performance as the dreaded Pennywise, It: Chapter Two had a relatively muted impact on me.*

[Chicago Sun-Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/9/3/20840972/it-chapter-two-review-movie-film-pennywise-stephen-king)

>*It Chapter Two is about redemption and the Losers coming together again to learn how strong they all are together. And the actors make it work. But the biggest problem is IT, because IT can be everything and IT can be nothing. IT has no real rules or motivations, or rhyme or reason, for literally anything he does.*

[Uproxx](https://uproxx.com/movies/it-chapter-two-review/)

>*Hader rises above the rest. If you've seen ""Barry,"" his HBO series, you know he has no problem blending comedy and drama. In this case, he adds horror to the mix, and he's just as good at that, too.*
