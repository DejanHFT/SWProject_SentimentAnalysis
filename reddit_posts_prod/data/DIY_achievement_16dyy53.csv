Need help matching colors to achieve a vibe for a room,BlackLabelTag,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/16dyy53/need_help_matching_colors_to_achieve_a_vibe_for_a/,1,2,"I'm currently trying to bring more color into my room which mainly consists of a wooden floor, greenish-gray wall, all black shelves, desk, & bed, and some accents of white from my PC. If I'm going for a relaxing vibe does that mean I should avoid warm colors like wood or red and add more things that have white/green/blue/purple colors?"
