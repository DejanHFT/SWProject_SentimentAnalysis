"AskScience AMA Series: We are Jeff Galvin and Dr. David Pauza (long time lurkers, first time posters) here to talk about “treating the untreatable, curing the incurable” -- the future of genetic medicine. How it works. What it can do. Ask us ANYTHING!",AmericanGene,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4fsmo4/askscience_ama_series_we_are_jeff_galvin_and_dr/,211,1718,"Who are we?


I’m Jeff Galvin, son of an MIT Electrical Engineer and inventor who pioneered advanced portable radar and analog signal processing. I’m an entrepreneur, Silicon Valley startup guy and former Apple International Product Marketing Manager in the 80’s; where I traveled the world introducing the original Macintosh (and LISA if you ever heard of that). Computer nerd from the 7th grade (early 1970’s), I taught basic computer programming on weekends at MIT and later became the youngest-ever Head Teaching Fellow for Natural Sciences 110 (the second largest undergraduate class on campus) at Harvard as a Sophomore. After a successful career in computers, software and the Internet, I retired to become a “Silicon Valley Angel Investor”. Retirement didn’t last long… I met Dr. Roscoe Brady at the National Institutes of Health and he showed me something that I immediately realized would be bigger than computers or the Internet ever became. In 2006, Dr. Brady opened my eyes to viral vectors and genetic technologies that I realized could let me reprogram the fundamental computers of life itself: the human cell. That “ah-ha moment” back in 2006 began my quest to solve intractable human disease by repairing the underlying genetic roots of cancers, inherited disorders and infectious disease. Now, I head a leading genetic technologies company that is going to help send chemotherapy and radiation for cancer the way of leeches and bloodletting, and provide treatments and cures for scores of formally un-addressable disorders and diseases.

TL;DR - Silicon Valley sweetheart turned genetic drug developer


The Activator - My name is David Pauza, an OG (original gene cloner) since the 1970s. My areas of expertise are human virology and cancer. For the last 30 years or so, I have been studying HIV / AIDS, publishing scientific papers and educating the public about viral diseases. Before joining AGT, I had started an HIV research program at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, then built a strong HIV program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and finally moved to the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. During those years my lab group focused on understanding the most basic steps in HIV disease and designing new treatments or vaccines. We first talked openly of curing HIV disease in 1992 and have kept that flame burning ever since. The path to a cure depended on studying fundamental aspects of human virology and immunology. Many of the lessons learned in our study of AIDS apply directly to human cancer, which continues to be a major threat to HIV+ people even with current therapy. I brought these perspectives, skills and some team members to American Gene Technologies where we are working with Jeff to chart innovative cures for major human diseases.


TL;DR - A scientist with deep knowledge and a big bag of tricks.


As we see it, the new frontier of drug development is genetic science, where rifle-shot treatments deal with the specific, underlying causes of disease, eventually leading to cures rather than lifetime treatments. We take a creative approach, believing that many diseases can be treated with genetic therapy if you mix the right technology with a solid understanding of disease and add advice from talented clinicians to guide treatment delivery.


We are currently focusing on HIV / AIDS, Liver Cancer, Phenylketonuria (PKU) and Breast Cancer. Ask us anything about our mission, gene therapy basics, new technology, research, development portfolio or the future!
