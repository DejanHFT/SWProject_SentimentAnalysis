Halp!  how do I get my creativity back?!  I thought you guys might know....,freshlylost,https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/n87b2/halp_how_do_i_get_my_creativity_back_i_thought/,19,3,"Being creative isn't just about being good at painting a picture.  It's also about being innovative, thinking outside the box, doing things that are unconventional etc.  These are skills that are very usefull in today's society.

When I was a kid, I was good at painting, drawing, writing etc.  Then my teachers discouraged me from doing those things in favour of concentrating on science and math and I began to ignore creative endeavours.  Then a few years ago, I got this nagging feeling that I needed to create something.  It got annoying and wouldn't go away.  So I realised I could no longer push this asside and I began painting again.

But I'm having trouble with the other parts - how do I foster innovation inside my brain again?  Is there like a method, or exercises that I can do to make my brain think creatively in life in general, again?"
