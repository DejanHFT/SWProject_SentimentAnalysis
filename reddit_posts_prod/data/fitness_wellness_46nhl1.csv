Whey protein powders that mix well with water?,tgreen7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/46nhl1/whey_protein_powders_that_mix_well_with_water/,60,26,"I have tried a lot of protein powders. I only mix them with water 
but most of the time they are just too thin and gross.

So far the only one I have found that tastes great is Met-rx protein plus.

Others who drink there protein powder with water, what is you go to? "
