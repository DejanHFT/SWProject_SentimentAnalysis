Long layover at Istanbul airport. What places should I explore?,sandymartin07,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16edx0z/long_layover_at_istanbul_airport_what_places/,7,1,"I (30M) would be returning from Europe to India in late October and intentionally booked flights with a 21-hour layover at the Istanbul airport. I will be arriving at 11 PM at night, and my next flight is at 8 PM the next day.

This is my second time being abroad all alone, and hence I am feeling a little anxious, but I'm excited to make the most of it. I was wondering what places I could travel to in the city and when I should start my travel. I reckon leaving the airport early in the morning at around 7-8 AM could be fine, and probably I need to return by 4 PM to the airport to have time for all the security checks.

I plan to take an Uber to the main city centre and thereafter walk around on foot doing photography. Please share some suggestions on which places I should definitely explore (with two of them definitely being Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia), and what cafes/restaurants I can visit for breakfast/lunch/baklava. Also, should I be concerned about safety in any of the places?"
