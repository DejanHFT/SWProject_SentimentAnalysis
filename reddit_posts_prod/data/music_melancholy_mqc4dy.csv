Melancholy but grounding music,turings_machina,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/mqc4dy/melancholy_but_grounding_music/,12,3,"Hi all,

I'm looking for a set of songs that are melancholy but grounding, as in they don't make you super depressed but puts you in like a slighly low energy state. 

&#x200B;

Reasoning is that music has a very pronounced feeling on me, to the point that it can make or break my day. I want to be grounded, and when I listen to slightly melancholy songs they tend to do that. Bonus if I can study to it.

Honestly not that great of a thing to have music affect me so viscerally. Because its if highbeat, I feel euphoric and im just distracted in my own little world, and then I chase that and then lose all sense of time, and my productivity plummets. 

&#x200B;

So let me know your recommendations. Hope I was clear
