"Jordan Peele's ""Us"" only works as a metaphor. Once you watch it a second time, it becomes silly the amount of plot holes.",Crafty-Bunch-2675,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/176urj0/jordan_peeles_us_only_works_as_a_metaphor_once/,2233,6996,"There are way...way too many things about the tethered that makes *zero* sense if you think about it even a little.... or if you watch the movie a second time.

For example... the scene at the Carnival where they tried to parallel the actions of the patrons above with the tethered below, makes so little sense if you think about it.

(1) How is it that all the tethered below just happen to look like the people in the Carnival ? It's not like the people live in the Carnival. 
So what happens when a new set of patrons reach the Carnival the day after  ? Do a new set of tethered magically appear in the facility below ?

(2) How are new generations of tethered born ?
How are adult tethered brought together to reproduce, to make children who exactly mimmick the children above ?

(3) ""red"" claims that the tethered were created by scientists, but the project was abandoned.
So how was ""red"" directed to marry ""Abraham"" ?

(4) Sometimes the copies are shown mimmicking the humans and sometimes they can act independently. How is it decided when a tethered can act independently , and when they cannot ?

(5) 
The boy is shown to trick/compell his tethered into killing itself by forcing it to walk backwards into a fire.
Why aren't the others able to do this ?
In fact, since Adelade is a tethered too... then technically shouldn't Red have been able to compell her to walk off a cliff ?

(6)
How do the tethered have clothes that mimmick what people are wearing that day ?
e.g. the tethered father of Adelade gives the shirt to her childhood self  and so she is dressed exactly like the girl above. ? How? Where do the clothes come from ?

Like I get it... the tethered are supposed to mimmick the people above... but it makes no sense when you think about it. It's like it's magic."
