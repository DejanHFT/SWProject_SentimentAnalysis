"My bench isn't progressing very well, what am I doing wrong?",pussyole684,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5hmiwm/my_bench_isnt_progressing_very_well_what_am_i/,19,7,"I'm a newbie to weight lifting, I currently do:

4x6 squats (82.5kg)

4x5 bench (47.5kg)

4x6 OHP (25kg) (only added this last week)

3x10 seated cable row (dunno, the machine doesnt have numbers lol)

3x8 dumbbell incline press (12kg)

3x5 deadlifts (105kg)

...3x a week

My squat and DL have been increasing much faster, my bench has increased by maybe 2.5kg in the past month. I try to bench 50kg and I always feel like I can't go past 4 reps. Should I be swapping any exercises, or adding exercises to help my bench? 

Also, is my workout ok? allow doing 5 sets of barbell work each time fam"
