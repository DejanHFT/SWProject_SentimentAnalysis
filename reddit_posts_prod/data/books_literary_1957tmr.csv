Who is your favorite literary character and why?,Professor_squirrelz,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1957tmr/who_is_your_favorite_literary_character_and_why/,91,45,"I tend to really like literary characters that have big redemption arcs with complex relationships with multiple other characters in the story. An example of this would be Jean Valjean from Les Miserables. 
His redemption arc is beautiful, how he goes from an ex-convict to an upstanding citizen who uses his acquired fortune and power to help those who are less fortunate. And I love his relationships with Marius, Cosette and Javier. 

What are your guys’ favorite literary characters and why? Is it because they are interesting, complex, similar to you etc? I’d love to know why."
