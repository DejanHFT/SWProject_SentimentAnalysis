I have difficulty writing after my brief spurts of inspiration.,sacarey77,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/dprist/i_have_difficulty_writing_after_my_brief_spurts/,38,240,"Sometimes I will get inspiration for a story, whether it be a quote that I heard or just an abstract idea. However if I do not immediately start working on writing, the inspiration is lost and I find it hard to bring myself to that same mindset later in the day. For an example, I had an idea for a short story that was inspired by a quote I heard on r/askreddit by Winston Churchill, however I was at work and couldn’t sit down to write it. Now it’s several hours later and I can’t find the same drive to write the story that I had when I had first thought it up."
