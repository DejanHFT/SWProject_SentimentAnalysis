Can Anyone Help Give me Guidance to Achieve Basketball Fitness?,MagicWade,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5b8nzd/can_anyone_help_give_me_guidance_to_achieve/,35,45,"Currently I am 14, 132lbs (about 60kgs) and I play the forward position for my team. For the first time I'm going to play with a shot clock (state division) and obviously I find myself getting tired quicker and losing muscular endurance. Alot of my game is reliant on the fact I am super athletic but can still hit shots but obviously I am more of a sprinter then a long distance runner because I feel tired quicker and my legs and biceps start getting tired meaning it eliminates the two strongest parts of my game. I started lifting light weights about 6 months ago but I want to get stronger and have more stamina especially with this long Christmas break we get. Can anyone recommend things to do to improve stamina, core, muscular endurance and arm and leg strength?



TLDR: playing with shot clock getting fatigued need to know what I should be doing to improve stamina, core, muscular endurance and arm and leg strength."
