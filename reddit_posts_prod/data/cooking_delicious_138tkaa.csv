Accidentally made delicious garlic and cant recreate it :(,yougotpwnd123,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/138tkaa/accidentally_made_delicious_garlic_and_cant/,8,9,"Hey guys, I was cooking one day (I think it was shrimp scampi?) and I cut up a bunch of fresh garlic, threw it in a pan and let it get slightly browned, then reduced with some white wine. The garlic came out absolutely delicious and melted in your mouth.

The problem is Iâ€™ve tried doing this multiple times since then and I canâ€™t seem to get that melt in your mouth that I got that one time, I can get them to the same browness and strong flavor but they dont have the same texture.

Please help me re-create this ðŸ˜­ I want to throw it onto everything I make"
