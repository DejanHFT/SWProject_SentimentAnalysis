"Can anyone point me to some relevant research on ""very demanding"" active style learning?",arisbe__,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/wq1y7m/can_anyone_point_me_to_some_relevant_research_on/,2,2,"Here are examples of what I am referring to (many of these have cult followings):

* The [Moore Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_method) (Inquiry based mathematics)
* Dan Friedman's [The Little Lisper](https://web.archive.org/web/20150426092105/http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/) series of programming books (are there other Socratic method style books that are designed for you to answer first?)
* Hans Ørberg’s [Lingva Latina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_%C3%98rberg) ***(I am particularly interested in this specific method)***
* The [Feynman (“Blank Sheet” or ""eli5"") Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching)
* Even the basic concept of reading the questions first and attempting an answer prior to reading a lesson's reading material."
