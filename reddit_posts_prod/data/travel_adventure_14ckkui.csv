Hello everyone! 
I’ve booked the Spain,Portugal and Morocco tour with G adventures but have read about Morocco being safe for a female traveller (I’m 27F, Indian heritage)

I thought booking a tour will keep me safer but now quite worried that I’ll be harassed/assaulted. 

Has anyone done this trip and if so did they feel safe as a solo female traveller?

Thanks!"
