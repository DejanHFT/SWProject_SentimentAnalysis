Introductory books on Philosophy of Science (particularly physics/mathematics)?,wtf_shroom,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/19q66w/introductory_books_on_philosophy_of_science/,17,10,"Hello:

I have recently developed a keen interest in the Philosophy of Science, especially physics and mathematics. My interest stemmed from a deep contemplation on the nature of time, space, quantum mechanics, and the different spatial dimensions. Before I go out and start purchasing books on a whim, I should ask you all if there are any fantastic introductory books on these topics that would be perfect for a beginner.

Thanks!"
