What are some historically accurate tv shows to watch?,SpaceSalamander08,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/iok8oo/what_are_some_historically_accurate_tv_shows_to/,674,995,"I recently just finished watching The Roman Empire and Hell on Wheels. I couldn’t help but think some parts of both shows were historically inaccurate unfortunately. I love history so it’s kind of annoying when shows make it seem like what they are saying is true, but most of it is just fluff and drama to make the show more interesting. Anyway, I’m hoping there’s some shows out there that focus on being truthful rather than spicing the story up with bullshit. Or perhaps some documentaries you may know of? Literally any history event interests me. Also what were your thought on those shows if you’ve seen them before? Did you find them historically inaccurate too?"
