'Zack Snyder's Justice League' Review Thread,SanderSo47,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/m5o22f/zack_snyders_justice_league_review_thread/,3724,2705,"[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/zack_snyders_justice_league): 76% (107 reviews) with 6.80 in average rating

> Critics consensus: Zack Snyder's Justice League lives up to its title with a sprawling cut that expands to fit the director's vision -- and should satisfy the fans who willed it into existence.

[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/zack-snyders-justice-league): 55/100 (33 critics)

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie.

> The new version is an improvement in some concrete ways. Its plot and tone are more coherent, with occasional puzzling exceptions. Its FX are substantially improved, though still sometimes fakey, and in general the photography looks better — though viewers may resent the frame's nearly square aspect ratio, which was designed with IMAX, not widescreen TVs, in mind. But the movie's soul, such as it is, remains unimproved, and at 242 minutes, very few of them offering much pleasure, it's nearly unendurable as a single-sitting experience. If it were watched in parts — title cards identify six chapters and an epilogue, and some rumors suggested it would be released as a series — those segments would fail to deliver the shapely balance of energies and pacing that one expects these days from even a merely competent TV show. This expanded version may be exactly the product desired by the legion of Snyder fans who cried to the heavens for its release. But nonmembers of that cult will find it just as unenjoyable as the original.

> If you like what Snyder does with superheroes, here’s a big four hours of it; if you don’t, same deal.

> Zack Snyder’s Justice League is a surprise vindication for the director and the fans that believed in his vision. With a mature approach to its superhero drama, better-realized antagonists, and improved action, Snyder’s version of Justice League saves the movie from the dustbin of history, something that likely only could’ve happened on a streaming platform like HBO Max. Though not every addition feels totally necessary, and some new visual effects stick out as unpolished, it's hard to overstate how much more enjoyable this version of Justice League is.

-[Tom Jorgensen, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/zack-snyders-justice-league-review): 8.0 ""great""

> The film has something preposterous but surreal, and there is a disturbing epilogue in which Wayne is confronted by his personal demons. Snyder’s film may be exhausting but it is engaging. Justice is served.

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/15/zack-snyder-cut-justice-league-review): 4/5

> While it feels like cultural factions have been fighting over “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” for years, the winners ultimately will be the fans. ‘ZSJL’ is a fan cut as much as it is a director’s cut, with all the indulgence that the notion applies. As for any continuation of the story as the fans hope, that seems gravely unlikely considering the direction Warner Bros is headed. But for a director who had to abandon his grand superhero project because of a family tragedy and because a big movie studio tried to wrestle control of the film, which was too much to bear at the time, one supposes, this postmortem collectible for die-hard, is about as good as an outcome as one could get.

> In the end, I have to admit that, for all its longueurs, Zack Snyder’s Justice League possesses its own kind of integrity. The possessive nomenclature of the title is deserved. I’m glad the clamorous fanboys agitated and made enough noise to see their dreams come true. We’ll learn soon enough if their faith is rewarded.

-[Todd McCarthy, Deadline](https://deadline.com/2021/03/justice-league-review-zack-snyder-directors-cut-hbo-max-1234714166/)

> The reality is that Justice League’s problems go beyond who was behind the camera. The villain is still generic and silly-looking. The plot is still assemble-the-team boilerplate, hinging on the hunt for glowing MacGuffins with a goofy name. Gadot’s Wonder Woman is still subjected to some slobbering objectification from her new teammates — proof that in at least one respect, Snyder and Whedon saw eye to lascivious eye. And, on the most basic level, it was still a miscalculation to try to rush the Avengers formula of success, to stuff introductions for so many new characters into one movie instead of giving them their respective starring vehicles first. That there’s ample elbow room for each of the film’s marquee attractions (you get to see Cyborg win the big high school football game!) just means that Justice League has become an inelegant everything-and-the-kitchen-sink version of itself instead of a ruthlessly streamlined, bastardized blockbuster. Faithful fans may very well cherish this unfiltered, super-sized helping of Snyder: The ironic happy ending to their cause is that the one film of his that he truly lost control of has been reborn into his magnum opus of excess, at least by volume. For the rest of us, a superior cut of Justice League remains out of reach, unreleased.

> The unwatchable 2017 comic-book calamity has been refashioned into one of the most spectacular superhero movies ever made.

> I truly hope that Snyder found some sort of solace in making this new version. I don’t know the man personally, but he seems like a good enough guy, and if this cut of Justice League brings him a modicum of peace, then at least we can say that in the film’s defense. But for the audience, Zack Snyder’s Justice League fails to make the case for its existence. It doesn’t radically change what we know about this approach to DC superheroes and given the underperforming box office returns of Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Justice League there’s not much audience appetite for it either. For those passionate, intense fans who demanded this new cut, now you have it. I hope it brings you peace.

> The Snyder Cut has its share of problems — when you get the best of Snyder, you also get the worst — but it’s an undeniably passionate and moving work. It earns its self-importance.

-[Bilge Ebiri, Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/movie-review-snyder-cut-justice-league-hbo-max.html)

> For long stretches, Zack Snyder’s Justice League feels more like a rough assembly than a director’s cut. It appears to include every single shred of footage Snyder shot, no matter how superfluous to the story. It will absolutely delight the hardest of hardcore Snyder heads. I’m not sure how more casual viewers will react to a longer and bleaker version of the same movie they already saw and dislike. That’s not to say Zack Snyder’s Justice League is worse than the theatrical cut. It is clearly an improvement. But it feels like a three hour cut could have been legitimately great. Anyone up to #ReleaseTheSlightlyShorterSnyderCut next?

-[Matt Singer, Screen Crush](https://screencrush.com/zack-snyders-justice-league-review-snyder-cut/): 6/10

> ""Zack Snyder's Justice League"" is so fragmented that it could've been titled ""32 Short Films about the Justice League."" It often makes momentous promises or sets up seemingly important relationships which it promptly forgets. It's so bombastic that it makes ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" seem modest. It will mainly please the people who clamored for it. Even fans of the genre might consider it a bit much. It owes as much to rock concerts, video games, and multimedia installations as it does to commercial narrative filmmaking. It's maddening. It's monumental. It's art.

-[Matt Zoller Seitz, RogerEbert.com](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/zack-snyders-justice-league-movie-review-2021): 3.5/4

> The overall effect often makes the Snyder Cut feel like an action video game where the goal is to tally up the number of knockouts each character can land. The film isn’t without its pleasures; it’s fun to see Aquaman and Wonder Woman beat people up and smirk afterward. I didn’t realize that watching Superman blow on stuff and freeze it with this super breath was something that would bring me immense happiness. And I’ve sunk an afternoon or more into video games in the past. But it would’ve been nice to see Snyder knock this out of the park and supplement his eye for visuals and his unique style with a story that had a bit more soul, especially with his very rare $70 million second chance.

-[Alex Abad Santos, Vox](https://www.vox.com/22325749/snyder-cut-review-justice-league-hbo-max): 3.5/5

> Prominent among the changes that Snyder has implemented, relative to the 2017 version of the film that featured cuts and re-shoots overseen by Joss Whedon, is to remove much of the anodyne “fun” that the Avengers mastermind incongruously inserted into what turns out to be a dour, proto-fascistic vision of mythical violence exercised in an utterly fallen world. Willfully unstructured and emphatically stationary, Zack Snyder’s Justice League could be taken as an intentional travesty of the superhero genre, if only it weren’t so tortuously tedious.
