[Update] Trying to achieve glass like finish with varnish on a coffee table,shahadar,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1mmoqt/update_trying_to_achieve_glass_like_finish_with/,9,22,"[Original Post Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1m3luw/trying_to_achieve_glass_like_finish_with_varnish/). Was trying to get a good glass-like finish on a coffee table I've been working on, and I got some great tips from /r/DIY. [This is the finish I've ended up with.](http://i.imgur.com/7HLAU6q.jpg) Brushed on one coat, dried and sanded. Brushed on another, dried and sanded, then put on a heavy coat by pouring the varnish directly onto the table and using the brush to spread it.

I made a couple of mistakes: 
1) I should have thinned out the varnish a little before applying, because the first and second layer both had significant bubbling
2) I still hadn't learnt my lesson with the final thick coat, but I brushed over with a layer of thinner and that ended up 'popping' most of the bubbles
3) Drying time for the final layer was two days (I didn't budget for that)
4) The sandpaper I used wasn't fine enough, so I have lots of scratches which still show. However it looks ok at the map is antique.

Thanks /r/DIY for the tips! This one was a learning experience, going to keep making them and learn from my mistakes! Picture of the whole table is in the original post - it pretty much still looks the same in photos."
