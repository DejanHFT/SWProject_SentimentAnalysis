Why is Intel still using 14nm in their cpu's when the technology for 5nm is already out?,Retrofiddle,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/kzdhyg/why_is_intel_still_using_14nm_in_their_cpus_when/,13,6,Intel's new rocket lake is using a 14nm and yet Samsung's new chip for its phones is using 5nm so the technology cleary exists. Is there no benefit for Intel to using a smaller node?
