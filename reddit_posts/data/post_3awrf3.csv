Is there a relationship between molecular KE and the Arrhenius Equation?,tsn123456789,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3awrf3/is_there_a_relationship_between_molecular_ke_and/,5,4,"[From this post]( http://chemistry.stackexchange.com/a/14928/8117), the E in Arrhenius equation is a thermodynamic potential barrier and could be a number of things (H, G, U etc). Per M-B distributions [like this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5DhD9f-X8Pc/TcaABhURwRI/AAAAAAAAAA4/aqi-tCsWXI4/s1600/Untitled.png), is the Ea on the x-axis equivalent to the E in Arrhenius equation? 

If so, what I don't get is, the M-B distribution shows that E is an absolute (kinetic) energy independent of temperature ([like here](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tqdkqW97hCI/TcaBMPtJtAI/AAAAAAAAAA8/FJ6HaaAeSSs/s1600/Untitled.png))but isn't activation energy a *relative* energy difference (between activated complex and reactants) and temperature dependent? Also KE technically isn't spoke in the same manner as U, H, G etc. so I'm confused about how KE could be subbed in as E directly."
