I am a high achieving high school kid with hopes of going to a competitive college. I am about to lose everything I have worked hard for because of one teacher. Help?,highschoolhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10izby/i_am_a_high_achieving_high_school_kid_with_hopes/,218,415,"I am currently a senior in high school, and I am in the middle of the college admission process. During the second week of school I turned in a lab for chemistry. Today, I found out that: my chemistry teacher thinks I cheated on the lab, she has already given me a zero and dropped my grade from a high-B to a D, and she plans to write me an integrity referral. If I receive an integrity referral I will be: kicked out of any honor society that I am currently a part of (4), not be able to walk at graduation with my classmates, and there is no way that I will get into any competitive college that I have worked so hard since freshman year for. I am extremely worried that the teacher will write the referral and my college dreams will be ruined.

On the lab, she insists that I cheated because my data table is similar to the data table of one of my lab partners. She is not concerned that I copied her conclusion or calculations. The teacher is just writing me up based on the fact that the way I set up my data table is similar to my partner's. I do not see how I am in the wrong. What can I do?

Edit: She told me today that she is ""still considering whether or not to send it to the Honor Review Board"". The HRB is a group of teachers and students who decide whether or not an integrity referral is warranted. Unfortunately, students are not allowed to know who is on the HRB, and they often side with the teacher.

Edit 2: The general consensus seems to be that I should talk to administration as soon as possible. You guys have convinced me to go first thing tomorrow morning rather than waiting until the end of the day tomorrow to see what she will do. I'll check in again tomorrow after school to update those of you guys that are interested enough to want to know how this ends up.


FINAL EDIT: Sorry guys it took me a few days to sort this out but here is what happened: I went and talked to the teacher the next day and she said that she ""is in a good mood so she won't give me the integrity referral"". She said I would have to redo the entire lab, well over 10 hours of work, and she would regrade it for up to half credit. This was much better news to me, but still unfair in my eyes. I realized that if she compromised some, I can get her to realize her mistake and grade me fairly. I went to the head of the science department (my physics teacher) and told him exactly what happened. He is a rational guy and he took my side. He then went and talked to the teacher for me, and I'm guessing defended my case. The chemistry teacher then told me that I would have to redo my lab, but she would grade it with full credit. I decided that this was the best case scenario I could get without involving administration. I chose not to involve them because if I did my relationship with my teacher would be forever stale and I would probably have to deal with something like this again. I redid the entire lab and got a 92% on it. I also went and talked to my teacher one last time, and although not explicitly, she apologized to me for the entire mess and me and her now get along decently."
