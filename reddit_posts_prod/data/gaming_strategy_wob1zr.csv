I'm looking for a RTS game similar to command and conquer where I can discover new (blacked out) lands by venturing to them and stumbling upon enemies' strongholds and defeating them. Hopefully medieval setting, but I'll take whatever I can get. I just want to recruit small dudes to take on bigger dudes until I can get bigger dudes to take on even bigger dudes and capture strongholds. Any ideas? 

It would be GREATLY appreciated!"
