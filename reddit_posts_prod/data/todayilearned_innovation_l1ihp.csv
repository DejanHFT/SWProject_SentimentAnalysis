TIL Hatsune Miku isn't just the cover art for the band: she's holographicly projected during live events with a live band. Japan: your innovation once again blows my mind.,Kyosama66,https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/l1ihp/til_hatsune_miku_isnt_just_the_cover_art_for_the/,3,8,"I'm just blown away by not knowing this sort of black magic existed yet. First: the Dyson air blades, now this?

Basically; ""she"" is a synthetic voice created by special synthesis software produced by Yamaha. Once SEGA (yes, Sonic the Hedgehog SEGA) got involved, she started putting on ""live"" concerts, where she would be projected on stage in front of a band to ""sing"" for sold-out shows.

Simply put, a projector is set up to throw the high-intensity image onto a thin, very transparent, special film run across the stage. This gives the impression that she is right there, dancing and whatnot.

I can't wait to see where this kind of advancement takes entertainment."
