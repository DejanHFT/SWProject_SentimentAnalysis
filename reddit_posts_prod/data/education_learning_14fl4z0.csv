In this mode of teaching, we shift the focus from being a traditional knowledge giver to becoming a facilitator, providing opportunities and resources that allow our students to build their own understanding through exploration, questioning, and critical thinking.

While I wholeheartedly support the theoretical principles of inquiry-based learning, the transition from lecture and memorization-heavy lessons can be quite challenging in practice, given the various constraints and expectations educators face.

What challenges have you faced when trying to incorporate inquiry-based learning into your classrooms? Some examples of challenges may include:

1. Limited resources (e.g., time, budget, materials) to facilitate hands-on and cooperative learning experiences.
2. Difficulty finding a balance between open-ended student inquiry and covering required curriculum outcomes.
3. Resistance or skepticism from administrators, parents, or students.
4. Assessing student progress, learning, and development in more subjective and student-driven environments.
5. Managing a classroom"
