First of all i am 22 years old male im 6.3ft (195cm) tall my current weight is 209 pounds (95kg) and living in Perth Australia, i didnt use a fad diet all i did was eat clean and train mean.

i was a really unhappy person, i was above 339 pounds (150kg) i was a loser i hid from all of my problems and blamed everyone else for what was my problems in life. i wanted to die i thought to my self there was no point of living anymore because of my weight i was scared and emotionally destroyed. i didn't want to leave my house or people coming over to my house because i was scared of what people might think/ say to me if they saw me.

In April 2014 was my biggest mile stone i ever made i had to do something i was getting worst and worst i had to stop feeling sorry for my self and start making a change. i didn't want to lose weight because i knew i was going to get loose skin but it was ether die at 25 or have loose skin... even though i wanted to kill my self over and over i didnt want to die.... it was just a cry for help thinking back now. 

So going to the gym being the fattest person there i was scared i didn't know what to do nor new how to use a treadmill. i worked out how to use the treadmill and start walking. in my first week of joining the gym and clean eating i lost 8 Pounds (4kg)... i started to lift weights and i loved lifting so much, weight lifting as help me so much.

**People have to understand even though you were the fattest person at the gym or don't know what you're doing no one is looking at you no one is judging you no one cares... its just you and a empty gym**

latter down the track in November i lost 132 Pounds (60kg). i am still that weight, i am now on the way of gaining muscle and becoming  lean. trying to become the perfect role model.

My life is so much better now i'm loving every second of it, i'm not scared to go out in public i can go to a clothes store and knowing that i can find a shirt that fits me. i don't have to be scared of what people are thinking of me. i can go out and meet new people and help new people... i have started studying to become a personal trainer. i want to help more people out. i want to help everyone i can.. i want people to be as happy as i am now! loose skin shouldn't be a problem for you. You just got to push past it, it much better to have it then having a heart attack. 

so this whole post is to make you know that you're not alone and life does get easier. you need to make the first step only you can change your life no one else can. one day you'll make that click in your head like i did..
