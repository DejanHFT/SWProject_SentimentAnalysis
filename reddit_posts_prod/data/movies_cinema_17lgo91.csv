Japanese Cinema,mikeol1987,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/17lgo91/japanese_cinema/,45,8,"I'd like some must watch lists for someone who is just getting into japanese cinema but really enjoys it, enjoys the culture and history.  


I know Kurosawa is the big boy, but I want some suggestions from all kinds of Eras for Japanese Cinema that are just too good to miss. I don't want to be stuck in Kurosawa's late 60s/70s stage. some suggestions from each decade would be great, or just essentially the best of the best, with a focus on general japanese life and history   


(no Anime suggestions please That's a whole seperate thing and I've got me a list for that)
