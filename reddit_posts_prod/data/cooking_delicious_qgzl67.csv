"If you are looking for an easy fast and delicious way to cook Tofu you should try the korean recipe ""Dubu-Jorim""",ridikolaus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/qgzl67/if_you_are_looking_for_an_easy_fast_and_delicious/,60,311,"Hey guys it took me (like many western people) a long time to cook proper satisfying tofu. I tried many different techniques like marinading it for hours...

This one is pretty fast, delicious and ""rich"" in taste. I consider it real ""soul food"". 

This is the link of the recipe I read that inspired me to re cook it if you want to give it a try but there should be many other recipes if you just google it. :)
