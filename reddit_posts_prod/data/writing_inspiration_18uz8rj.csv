How the HECK do I Tell the Difference Between Copying/Inspiration,Spirits08,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18uz8rj/how_the_heck_do_i_tell_the_difference_between/,20,4,"This has always been a problem as I get a LOT of my ideas from songs and stuff. 

For example, if I listen to the song Wonâ€™t Say Iâ€™m in Love from Hercules and decide I want my character to deny his love for another character because his past love died and he wasnâ€™t able to save them, and is now afraid to love someone else in fear of losing them in the same way, is that copying Megâ€™s story? 

Or, if I listened to Right Hand Man, from Hamilton, and it gives me the idea to write a story about a group of 5 friends in an army (all who joined there due to different reasons than in Hamilton) and one of them gets chosen by the General to be his right hand man, is that copying? Can I keep the same general idea but change some things so itâ€™s not as similar, if so how much do I need to change?

I saw a Reddit post that was talking about the disappointment someone had for an idea the game shouldâ€™ve used where one of the faction takes back an area that was taken over by the bad guys. I wanna write a fanfic based off of this idea (in the same universe, so like taking their idea and turning it into an actual story, like an AU Fanfiction) with other plot points, and Iâ€™d love to write that but I feel like thatâ€™s definitely copying. Is there a way to do this without it being copying? Tbh I doubt it but thought maybe Iâ€™d ask anyways ðŸ˜­

Iâ€™m confused and do NOT want to copy anyoneâ€™s work in any way, so if this is copying Iâ€™d like to know and if thereâ€™s a way to salvage it + ensure itâ€™s simply inspiration and not copying. 

Also, if thereâ€™s a good rule of thumb or something to follow for future refrence that would be extremely helpful, I love writing and getting ideas from other people but I think I have a bad habit of copying/my ideas being too similar to the original content. Thanks :)

Edit: added another situation"
