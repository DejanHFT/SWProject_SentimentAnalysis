Is the 1000lbs club achievable in 1 year? Couch to 1k?,CaptBoxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3franh/is_the_1000lbs_club_achievable_in_1_year_couch_to/,22,2,"36 m 180lbs with a decent level of general fitness but no history of sustained lifting. If you run out the weekly increases for 5x5 you end up well over 1k pounds assuming no de-loading but I'm not sure how realistic that is. 

Thoughts?"
