**WHAT ARE THE ADVANCED/CASUAL CATEGORIES?**

We will be splitting the contest up into two groups: ADVANCED and CASUAL. The 'Advanced' category is for those that want to compete for bigger/better prizes and plan on being more competitive. The 'Casual' category is the default for those that are new to fitness/nutrition or would prefer not be in the advanced group. If you want to be 'Advanced', please make it known in your introduction post title (i.e. Introduction Post M/23/6'4"" - ADVANCED). 

As a continuation of this, we will now have twelve total winners.

**WHAT IS THE COMMUNITY PROGRESS REPORT?**

At the end of the submission process (http://rohitnair.net/btfc/index.php), you will be asked if you want to join the Community Progress Report. Do it. 

1. We can do some really neat statistical analysis at the end if enough people do it.
2. You will be entered into a draw if you do it regularly for a prize.
3. We may hand out random prizes for people that do it.
4. RHAINUR makes really pretty graphs/data to show how the whole community is doing.

**BUT I JUST CUT FOR THE SUMMER!**

Now you can cut (Catwoman) or bulk (Bane) for Halloween. My goal is to look as sexy as possible in my French maid costume. "
