Repoint + render & plaster or just render and plaster?,CRZXOJ,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/xhc7z7/repoint_render_plaster_or_just_render_and_plaster/,18,173,"So, I've removed a bath tub and discovered that the person who installed it 30+ years ago had removed the plaster and render to get the bath to actually fit.

There are cracks under around and under the window which are actually mirrored on the outside of the building too which I want to get sorted, should I remove the plaster to repoint and replace bricks inside?

So, going forward shall I repoint and replace bricks and  then render and plaster or will just rendering and plastering be good enough as someone has suggested to me. I want to have the job done properly not easily.

(Edit: by repointing I'm meaning removing old crumbling mortar and bricks and replacing them. The internal wall has render and the outside is plain brick. Image of the external wall https://ibb.co/vq7ByNT )
