Feeling frustrated that my best friend of over 10 years isn’t being supportive,julia_bunny,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/yjqh9u/feeling_frustrated_that_my_best_friend_of_over_10/,2,1,"My (F,28) fiancé (M,31) was recently offered a job that would be a major step forward in his career. It comes with a $25,000 pay raise, but there’s an 80% chance that we would have to temporarily move to Hawaii in January. We would be in Hawaii for between 10-12 months and we would be renting a house (we definitely couldn’t afford to buy a house there). If we do move to Hawaii, he is guaranteed a negotiable cost of living salary change at a minimum of 15% (which would put his salary at over 100k). 

When I told this to my best friend/MOH (NB,28) their response was “The US Navy is actively leaking petroleum into the drinking water aquifers there, and native Hawaiians are begging people to stop moving/visiting. Ultimately of course the decision is up to you two, but those are my biggest thoughts on it”. That’s all they said. No excitement over the raise or what this would mean for my fiancé’s career or even admitting they didn’t want me to go because they would miss me. 

I decided to encourage my fiancé to accept the job but I’m still frustrated that my best friend/MOH isn’t being more supportive. Should I talk to them about it? And what should I say?

Additional information: 
- My best friend had really shitty birth parents and has since been adopted by my birth parents (to the degree that they currently live with our parents and are referred to as my sibling, even by our extended family).

- My fiancé and I are getting married on December 10 (just over a month away!) and we had planned on starting a family in the next year, but if we go to Hawaii we won’t be starting a family while we are there.

- Feel free to look at one of my previous posts for more context/drama involving my MOH/best friend.

TLDR: my best friend is trying to guilt me about moving to Hawaii for my fiancé’s work and I’m angry they can’t even pretend to be supportive"
