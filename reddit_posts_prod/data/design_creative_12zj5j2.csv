Is current education and training stifling creativity?,hufflesnuff,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/12zj5j2/is_current_education_and_training_stifling/,0,1,"Ive been watching interviews with old imagineers and designers and the people interviewing them seem so cookie cutter in comparison. I find Bob Gurr's distain for the mentioning of ""process"" interesting. I've also noticed people in my field of informal education have been really intent on having programs and such a lot more structured. I wonder if it has to do in part with manager training, intense competition, and of course regulations. I actually had a recent interview for an upper level position that was really refreshing , and the reason why he wanted to learn more about me was cause he wanted someone less structured on his team. If you are curious this is the interview that inspired this post https://youtu.be/q_6OAEmnMUA"
