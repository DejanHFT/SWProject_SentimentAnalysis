What are your personal historical pet peeves/common misconception you always correct?,dmacarro,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2beg97/what_are_your_personal_historical_pet/,141,14,"This came to mind seeing Dwayne Johnson promote his new film ""Hercules"" and every time I hear it mentioned or see Kelly Ripa do the Eddie Murphy [""Hercules! Hercules!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxYQQoYfMtQ) clap, I clench my teeth and say ""It's Heracles! He's Greek not Roman!"" I mean we don't commonly call Odysseus Ulysses anymore.

I know it is stupid and petty and someone can make an argument ""well they're different"" but the personal opinion is sort of the point of a *pet* peeve. 

EDIT: If you object to my answer because it is mythical, I think it is relevant in understanding classical Greeks' culture and perception of their own past and was certainly discussed at least in my university history classes along with the Trojan war as reflecting a poorly remembered Mycenaean period in the Bronze Age."
