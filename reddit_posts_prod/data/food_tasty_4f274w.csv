"IAMA amateur chef who makes cheap, tasty food on a full schedule. AMA!",itsmevichet,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/4f274w/iama_amateur_chef_who_makes_cheap_tasty_food_on_a/,89,154,"Hey there, Reddit. I was born and raised in Philly to a Khmer family that pinched pennies and only bought things on sale.

Growing up always being short on time and money meant that I learned a lot about making tasty meals on the cheap. Also, when you and your cousins gotta peel 30 lbs of shrimp every time some Cambodians wanna get down, you learn to go Ricky Bobby fast.

My friends have been telling me for a while that I make some pretty good stuff, but I'll let you guys be the judge of that. Here's an album I made for the AMA, called Two Meats, One Sauce: **http://imgur.com/a/Y88Vo**

And here's my imgur profile in general, for some of the other stuff I've made: **http://itsmevichet.imgur.com/**
