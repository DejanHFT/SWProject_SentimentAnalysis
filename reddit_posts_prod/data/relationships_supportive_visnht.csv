BF (25M) going on a 3 week trip and I’m (25F) trying to be supportive,Boopidibop,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/visnht/bf_25m_going_on_a_3_week_trip_and_im_25f_trying/,7,3,"
My (25F) BF (almost 25,M) is going on a 3 week long trip with his buddies to Nepal. They’re planning on a fun but challenging adventure in which they track through the jungle with limited recourses and then walk all the way to the base camp of the Everest. 

 We’ve been together for almost 2 years, and are moving in together before he leaves. I love him more than anything, he’s my life partner and an incredible boyfriend and I want him to be happy. 
I don’t mind him going without me (as I’m reconverting from a surgery and don’t really like the types of nature trips anyway) and I of course trust him and know he is loyal to me as I’m to him. 

But I’m A) scared for his safety, trying not to show it so I don’t bum him out, but I’m really afraid something will happen to them and they’re in the middle of nowhere and all, and 
B) Going to miss him so so so much and know I’ll be sad and might feel lonely in our new apartment all on my own. 

It’s really important for me to be supportive of him, I know he’s really excited for this adventure with his friends and in general I just want him happy. 
What do I do? How do I express my fears (or maybe I shouldn’t) and how do we get through this period of time the best way? 
Thanks guys

TL;DR: 
My BF is going on a 3 week trip with friends, how do I make this period of time easy for us as a couple?"
