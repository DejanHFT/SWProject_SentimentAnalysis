I draw on perspectives from sociology, history, global public health, and science and technology studies (STS). I am passionate about public engagement and science communication. I have spoken on radio/TV, written media articles and am currently curating a physical and digital exhibition about the past and present of typhoid fever: [www.typhoidland.org](http://www.typhoidland.org/). I tweet with [@SJVanders](https://twitter.com/sjvanders) and [@typhoidland](https://twitter.com/typhoidland).
