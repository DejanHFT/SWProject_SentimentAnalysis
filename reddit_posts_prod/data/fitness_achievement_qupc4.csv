I did it! I achieved one of my childhood dreams!,footballer05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/qupc4/i_did_it_i_achieved_one_of_my_childhood_dreams/,166,329,"So not the most exciting thing in the world, but I finally managed to dunk! Granted it wasn't much of a dunk, I barely managed to squeeze it in there. I've wanted to dunk for as long as I can remember, hell i'm not even very good at basketball, but the dunk has remained a goal of mine forever. Something about seeing those guys in the NBA throw it downs just looks so damn cool. I think that all the squats/cleans have really helped me get a few more inches on my jumping ability, I think with a bit more practice I can probably start to throw it down for real. Just felt like sharing!"
