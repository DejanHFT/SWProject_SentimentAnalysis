Best historic TV shows ?,Malfhots,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hivcmx/best_historic_tv_shows/,65,28,"Hey guys. Looking for shows that either depict real history or popular history in a somewhat authentic way.

Shows like the The Tudors, Rome, or even semi documentaries like Netflixs Roman Empire.

Like you can see I prefer anything pre 1700 but any good historical TV show recommendation is welcome. Thanks !"
