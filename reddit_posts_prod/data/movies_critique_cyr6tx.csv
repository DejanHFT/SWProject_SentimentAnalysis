Mortal Kombat (1995) is the best movie adaptation of a video game yet.,TheSonsofBatman,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/cyr6tx/mortal_kombat_1995_is_the_best_movie_adaptation/,307,443,"Yesterday I went on and rewatched Mortal Kombat. All these movies that released these past years which looked promising like Assassin's Creed to the godawful Resident Evil films made it difficult for these movies to work. But after rewatching Mortal Kombat, I think and it isn't saying much, but Mortal Kombat honestly works. It's cheesy and a product of its time, but as a film, the characters works. Johnny Cage's arc is pretty well done and it was an interesting move having these three characters at the forefront with Kang, Sonya Blade and Johnny Cage. The story works and doesn't rely on deep lore to non-gamers. It's surprisingly simple and it's a pretty solid movie? Is it a perfect film? God no! But if you look at all these adaptations of games into films, this one stands out the most. I recommend people check this out if you haven't. A lot of people who critique this movie basically just make fun of the VFX than the story and characters and fight choreography. 

I hope the reboot coming in 2021 fixes the mistakes of the 1995 one and takes the title."
