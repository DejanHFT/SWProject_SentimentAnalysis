"Outside current technology, is there a maximum physically possible download speed? If so, what is it?",UnderPressureVS,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/azcp47/outside_current_technology_is_there_a_maximum/,19,10,"Sort of like the speed of light. No matter how good our propulsion technology gets, we will never get anything to travel faster than light. Even all those dubious ""realistic"" possibilities like space-warping or wormholes are just workarounds, the actual object never traverses space faster than light.


Similarly, is there a maximum amount of information you can transmit per second, regardless of how good our computing technology gets?"
