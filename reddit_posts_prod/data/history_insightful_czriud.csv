I'm trying to recreate an Ivy League level Masters education in Modern European History. What are your suggestions?,energeticlotuseater,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/czriud/im_trying_to_recreate_an_ivy_league_level_masters/,21,12,"I have a bachelor's degree in history and always wanted to try to go for my masters. However, now that I'm thirty years old with a mortgage,a good paying job,a wife, etc I don't believe it's practical to go back to school to pursue my PhD or even my masters at this point in my life.

I have always been curious of the curriculum of an Ivy league level masters history program though and wonder if anyone on reddit had any insight on what a Harvard, Columbia, Yale, etc level masters program in something like Modern European History (from the fall of Napoleon in 1815-end of WWII in 1945). I've looked into the available bachelors programs of other top universities and their curriculum which are usually posted online but I've read most of their material at some point in my life and it usually is pretty entry level stuff. I would be curious to see an outline of what top level masters degree programs read and even more interested in some lectures of that same level that are available online (preferably for free) that are masters level.

If anyone has any insight into the material studied in these higher level masters programs or even an actual link to a curriculum i would be very interested."
