"Do insects have ""brains""?",marklar4201,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/358v2h/do_insects_have_brains/,5,9,"I've always wondered about insect ""cognition"" if you could call it that. As far as I know they have a central nervous system, but it seems rather crude and very different from ours. Are they capable of ""thinking"" in any sense of the word? Can they learn? Do they have ""behaviors,"" hormones, variable responses to stimuli? Or are they pretty much like AI bots in a video game, where they respond to stimuli in an extremely predictable way?"
