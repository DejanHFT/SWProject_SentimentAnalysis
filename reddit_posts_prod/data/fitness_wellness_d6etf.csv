Help me choose a wellness course?,dprimedx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/d6etf/help_me_choose_a_wellness_course/,10,2,"I have to take a wellness course this year at school. It fits in nicely with my trying to get into shape. I'm running a few times a week and will be using the gym, too, once I get back to school. I'm in fair enough shape and can run a decent 5k, working up to a 10k. I've narrowed my 500 and some odd options down to just a handful. Fittit, what should I take?

* Kung Fu: Shaolin (Level 1)
* Beginner's Swimming (I can't swim too well)
* Irish Step Dance
* Tai Chi (Fast paced)

Unfortunately, those are the only four that fit around my schedule. I'm okay with any of them, but your input is welcome. If you'd like to see the course descriptions, just let me know and I'll tack them on. Thanks!"
