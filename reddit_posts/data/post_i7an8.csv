Would a human equivalent AI really need a computer as powerful as the human brain?,strategosInfinitum,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/i7an8/would_a_human_equivalent_ai_really_need_a/,13,10,"I asking this as i understand that only a portion of our brain is dedicated to higher level reasoning and consciousness a lot of brain functions would not be needed in an AI such as things that control the digestive system ,hormones, respiration, heart etc, also the brain may not doing everything as efficiently for example simple math.

couldn't  we build a human equivalent AI but with a much less powerful computer than the brain itself by optimizing it much better?"
