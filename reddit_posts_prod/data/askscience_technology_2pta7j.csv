Would it be possible to use time dilation to travel into the future?,The_Punned_It,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2pta7j/would_it_be_possible_to_use_time_dilation_to/,573,2051,"If somebody had an incurable disease or simply wished to live in future, say, 100 years from now, could they be launched at high speeds into space, sling shot around a far planet, and return to Earth in the distant future although they themselves had aged significantly less? If so, what are the constraints on this in terms of the speed required for it to be feasible and how far they would have to travel?  How close is it to possible with our current technologies? Would it be at all cost effective?"
