Why did the English language change so much from 17th to 18th century? Example within.,nomerde,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hiza8/why_did_the_english_language_change_so_much_from/,178,366,"I've always liked reading about history but only recently discovered the joys of reading primary source material. During my search for original writings I discovered something perplexing and was wondering if any more learned readers of English history might share their insights.

I noticed I can pickup a 18th century document and read it with relatively little difficulty. But if I go back just one more century and read something from the 17th century, I cannot understand most of it without re-reading it 10 times. Why did the language change so much from 17th to 18th century when from 18th to 21st century it doesn't change much?  And what good history books are out there that describe this presumed cultural shift from 17th to 18th century?

Examples:

Beginning of Thomas Paine's Common Sense. 1776

> PERHAPS the sentiments contained in the following pages, are not yet sufficiently fashionable to procure them general favor; a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficial appearance of being right, and raises at first a formidable outcry in defence of custom. But the tumult soon subsides. Time makes more converts than reason.

Beginning of William Bradford's Of Plimouth Plantation 1647

> IT is well knowne unto ye godly and judicious, how ever since ye first breaking out of ye lighte of ye gospell in our Honourable Nation of England, (which was ye first of nations whom ye Lord adorned ther with, affter yt grosse darknes of popery which had covered & overspred ye Christian worled,) what warrs & opposissions ever since, Satan hath raised, maintained, and continued against the Saincts, from time to time, in one sorte or other.   Some times by bloody death and cruell torments; other whiles imprisonments, banishments, & other hard usages; as being loath his kingdom should goe downe, the trueth prevaile, and ye churches of God reverte to their anciente puritie, and recover their primative order, libertie, & bewtie.
