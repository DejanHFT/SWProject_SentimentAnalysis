Best way to hike the Machu Picchu Inca Trail and explore Peru?,Otherwise-General289,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/184ocbe/best_way_to_hike_the_machu_picchu_inca_trail_and/,5,2,"Currently looking at the different guided tour and hike packages and I am being overwhelmed with options! The Inca trail seems to be very popular and something me and my friend (or two) want to do. We are early twenty males who are pretty active. We are still budget conscious but see some pretty good deals, I think we are budgeting $1.5k each excluding airfare. Is it worth doing the packages or going on yourself? Since PTO is a thing, I think we want a trip no more than 11 days coming from the US west coastâ€¦ seems like 14 days is popular and is this something we should be considering? We want to do Machu Pichu/4 day Inca trail, and then explore Cusco and Lima.

Any input and experience you have is appreciated!"
