"TL;DR here is ""How can (neuro)science help me figure out how to erase brains and make meat puppets?""  Kind of long.",Gaudeamus,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/h15mz/tldr_here_is_how_can_neuroscience_help_me_figure/,4,3,"Dear /r/askscience,

I'm working on some sci fi and it's very important to me that I be as accurate/plausible as possible with the science in this story.  Ahead of time, I apologize for the length.  I've put a lot of thought into this idea because it addresses specific questions I have and what's outlined here is a major portion of what I'm trying to explore.  It seemed easier to just lay out what I'm thinking so that you would know where I'm coming from and why I'm asking what I'm asking.  I really debated about posting this because I feel the idea is so far-fetched it might be ridiculed so I really hope I'm not wasting anyone's time.  Thanks in advance for reading this.  I appreciate it very much.

In an alternate Earth life is pretty good and science is pretty free.  Life extension isn't really happening though so people turn to life enhancement.  Glaen Enterprises is at the head of the class in this field with their Artis procedure which is named after Artis Glaen, who pioneered its development.  The Artis is a Direct Neural Interface system (or should I be using Brain-Computer Interface?) that uses nanites delivered into the skull.  The nanites form what's called a Grown Control Mesh which acts like a transceiver for wireless signals to/from various devices.  The first use for this is for people who are unable to go out for walks and things, and basically someone goes for a walk in the park and has the experience recorded using their GCM.  The memory is then relayed to the patient who is able to ""experience"" going for a walk.  Another therapeutic use is in ""memory therapy"" in which negative memories can be removed or altered and replaced with more positive ones, based on my idea that we behave based at least partially on what we have experienced.

Once Artis is in wide use in the medical and legal fields (or wide-ish) the porn industry picks it up and begins to create ever more immersive pornographic encounters, and the video game industry follows.  For a while porn really boosts the amount of research money Glaen receives.

Some other uses of the Artis include:

The Still-Life camera, an aborted suicide alternative which allows a person to ""drop out"" of the real world and exist in their minds, reliving what they might consider the best times of their lives.  The drawbacks are that they can never experience anything they haven't experienced before and among other things a large number of the people who test it become trapped on this existence.  It never makes it to market.

""Diversions"" because I haven't come up with a better name for it yet.  These can be virtual trips to places or truly immersive games.  A popular diversion is the ENet, short for ""Everything Net"" because the users can potentially experience everything, including sensations which would ordinarily be physically impossible.  While not a diversion, an application of this technology could be used by doctors to better understand a patient's symptoms.

The ENet itself is sort of like the internet, only an immersive virtual representation, so that for instance users in a chat room could seem to be in an actual room and instead of typing out their actions they could simply virtually enact them.

The last and most controversial application is that of Effigies, which are human clones that have no will or identity.  I know this is involved with the lobes on the cerebral cortex, so I have to come up with some way of erasing the personal ""I"".  Effigies are designed with the first users of the Artis in mind.  Instead of just being able to experience someone else's memories, a patient could connect wirelessly with their clone, whose brain is mapped to theirs, and they could simply live through the effigy as if it were their own body.  Their own minds are simply projected from the patient's GCM into the effigy's, at which time they assume control of the body.  If a poorly-modified brain slips through quality control the effigy's user could get an uncomfortable sense that they are fighting with the mind of the effigy.  Effigies also become commercial after some time, and their ""pilots"" all use a chamber which exudes a sedative gas so that they are not receiving input from their own bodies and the bodies of effigies at once.  I have a hypothesis that we can only experience one reality at a time and that the intrusion of real life into an effigy user's experience could cause some kind of mental discord, I don't know.

There are a lot of other applications of this technology that I haven't gotten into like for instance the military looking into it to see if it's viable for some operations vs using robots.  Later in the future, scientists in the field of Artificial Intelligence kind of get into recording the experiences of willing subjects and seeing if they could somehow assist in the development of an AI which has ""experienced"" a large number of various human experiences.

With that all said, here are my questions:

Hypothetically, how could the cerebral cortex be altered to allow the creation of effigies?  In the story they are grown in a special facility and sold at dealerships, so the process would have to be pretty standard in order for it to go to that level of production.
Is it possible there could be some ""identity creep"" if it's altered incorrectly?  A neuroscience student friend mentioned that a decerebrate body could get some creep if the neocortex overgrows.  Are there any examples in the real world that even come close to this concept, like maybe could something like this contribute to Alien Hand type situations?  I'm thinking like some little mini-identity exists alongside someone's ""actual"" identity and can't do anything but maybe control the alien limb.  I know Alien Hand Syndrome is a result of injury but just like a twin can be absorbed and have some physical bits left over, are there any cases in the real world where there is the mental remnant of another ""true"" identity inside a person?  It just seemed if that were somehow possible in the real world, then it wouldn't seem outrageous in an altered brain.

If a Grown Control Mesh could exist, could it be injected into the skull in a suspension and the nanites assemble themselves?  Is it an unethically 
dangerous idea?  I know some companies have patented forms of BCI (like Sony) and that there are already attachments/implants used in medicine.  I know monkeys have flown radio controlled planes with their brains using implants, so I'm just imagining the GCM as a tiny version of that.  

I suspect the scientists involved here don't know the exact contents of the information being broadcast (I imagine it as sort of like radio bands, only bands of brain info) and they can simply correlate a band with the approximate type of information it carries.  In this way I imagine they can develop the means to target the senses specifically.  Is this even hypothetically possible or am I thinking about it all wrong?

I'm operating under the idea that only one person can be in one mind at once and that no effigy can be controlled by more than one person because of the whole brain mapping thing.  Is this wrong?  I want to really explore the ideas of what constitutes reality, whether it's tangible or simply what comes from our brains.  If someone could travel to the Louvre via the recorded memory of someone else or even many someone elses, does it mean they don't ever have to go for themselves?  Would it be possible for someone to break into a user's connection and insert phenomena that could make that user believe they are going insane, or worse, completely alter that user's perception of the world around them?

There's no suggestion of retrieval of brain information from users, but could either accidental or forceful retrieval of information become an issue?  The only information I imagine would be accessible to anyone is that which is being actively transmitted/received, and nothing which is stored or ""thought of"".  It's not something I am thinking of using but if it could be a potential problem in this imaginary situation I want to make sure to avoid it or at the least make use of it.

This whole thing is tied up with a lot of questions I have about identity, experience,  memory and how much of us is made of what we experience and whether by changing what our brains take in, we can change ourselves.

Again, many thanks.  If this whole idea is implausible or needs some different direction, I want to either discard or repair it.  For sure, there is some problem or application I have not considered.  I'm just looking for a little guidance because I'm at the point where the combinations of the basic ideas are difficult to find information on.

TL;DR: How can (neuro)science help me figure out how to erase brains and make meat puppets?"
