The writer makes statements in a seemingly objective writing style about Hollywood's agenda to promote white men by pointing to examples of movies he considers bad that were honoured by the Oscars. Examples of movies he thinks shouldn't have received accolades: The Green Mile, Chicago, and Dallas Buyers Club. So he's using subjective (and unpopular) opinions to make objective claims about the industry. It seems to me that all this criticism comes from people who would have made these criticisms no matter what. They come in with an agenda, and they assess the quality of films based on a quota of inclusion, rather than the artistic merits of the films.

(I should note that I actually agree with his main point: *Parasite* was excellent, and is also my choice for Best Picture)."
