What meal or single dish you prepare makes you grunt like a happy little truffle pig in the mud as soon as you take a bite?,with_MIND_BULLETS,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/193m8n1/what_meal_or_single_dish_you_prepare_makes_you/,1341,2073,"I’ll go first: Everything bagel with lox! 

The build from bottom to top:

- Open face (both sides) toasted everything bagel
- full fat plain cream cheese
- capers
- very thinly sliced red onion
- 1 slice of heirloom tomato (lightly s&p’d)
- 3 oz salmon lox, divided (Atlantic, Sockeye, or King only, no pink or keta)  
- light squeeze of lemon over the lox
- sprinkle on some fresh chopped dill

Sweet baby Hay-suesse, that shit was delicious! 


I will also get ornery for a juicy fried chicken thigh."
