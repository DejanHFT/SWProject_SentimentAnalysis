Milestone Achieved: 350lb Bench press (1.75xBW) after a Smolov Jr Cycle. Write up inside.,MEatRHIT,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/xsxbj/milestone_achieved_350lb_bench_press_175xbw_after/,78,81,"So here is my quick and dirty write up of my Smolov Jr Cycle:

**Beginning**: I started out with a 1RM [around 315lbs paused](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1487hYDtEzk), I initially started the cycle because ""snapped my shit up"" deadlifting and wanted to give it some rest while still bumping my powerlifting total up. 

**Program**: I ran [Smolov Jr](http://wkak.net/SmolovFAQ.htm) for the regular prescribed 3 weeks (+10lbs each week) and then another week at another 15lbs since I was having such an ""easy"" time in week 3. I have some of my videos of the work sets on my youtube page but was told I could no longer use my camera so I don't have any after week 1.

**End of Program**: I ended up my last 10x3 day (last Thursday I think) using 305lbs and it was insanely tough and probably shouldn't have done that day as my shoulder was perfectly fine up to that point but has been a bit sore since.

**New 1RM Video**: [Today I benched 350lbs for 1 with some left in the tank](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu_LR60RSzg), I didn't pause because I *really* wanted to get 360 and didn't want to wear myself out too much. I then attempted 360 but my spotter grabbed the bar when he saw it move down a *bit*, in his defense I always tell him to take the bar when I say something or when the bar travels back down, which it did, but I may still have been able to lock it out.

**Shitty Excuses**: I had crap for sleep last night but that wasn't going to get better the rest of the week so fresh I could probably have gotten the 360. 350 was actually my end of the year goal so not bad for August.

**Training from here**: I'm going to taper the volume down rather than going straight back to 5/3/1 like I did last time I ran Smolov Jr. I peaked from 285->315 back in February-ish and it settled to ~300 a few weeks later, hopefully tapering down will alleviate the peak a bit. I would like to get a ""Masters"" total at my powerlifting meet in December at 198lbs (1375lb total). I'm still nursing my back, but squats seem to be fine so I'll be running a variation of 5/3/1 and squatting at least 2x a week and doing targeted assistance work for deadlifts (rows, good mornings, etc.).

**Other stuff**: 

**Supplements**: [D-AA](http://examine.com/supplements/D-Aspartic+Acid/), [Fenugreek](http://examine.com/supplements/Fenugreek/), [I3C](http://examine.com/supplements/Indole-3-Carbinol/), Creatine, Whey, DS Craze or C4 (pre workout)... I think that is about it.

**Bodyweight**: floating around 200-205 @ 5'11"" after starting creatine back up

**Training History**: 180lb Bench Bro with fuckarounditis up to 1.5 years ago, when I started squatting and deadlifting, switched to 5/3/1 shortly there after (somewhere around 300/250/400) separated my shoulder snowboarding February 2011 and had to take ~3 months off. In my first powerlifting meet in December my lifts were 365/275/500 if I remember correctly

**Other PRs**: Squat:435x1 Deadlift:525x1

I'll be up for a little bit to answer a few questions if they arise."
