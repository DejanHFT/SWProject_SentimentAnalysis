"Is Nizwa (Oman) a good base to explore Jabal Shams, Jabal Akhdar, etc",MichaelStone987,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1714p3u/is_nizwa_oman_a_good_base_to_explore_jabal_shams/,0,5,"I will be traveling Oman for a week in December. My plan was to stay 2 days in Muscat and then rent a car and mainly explore sights ""around"" Nizwa, i.e. Jabal Shams, Jabal Akhdar, Jabreen Castle,Bahla Fort,Wakan Village, etc. Then I would go from Nizwa to Sur and back to Muscat. Does that sound reasonable and is Nizwa a good base? "
