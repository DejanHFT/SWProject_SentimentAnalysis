"Has a Platonian aristocracy, or anything close, ever been attempted?",minerva_qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/o51q8/has_a_platonian_aristocracy_or_anything_close/,5,6,"EDIT: A brief description (excuse the wiki copy and paste)

Aristocracy is the republic. This regime is ruled by philosopher king, and thus is grounded on wisdom and reason. The aristocratic state, and the man whose nature corresponds to it, are the objects of Plato's analyses throughout much of The Republic's books, as opposed to the other four types of states/men, who are studied primarily in Book VIII.

The aristocratic state that Plato idealizes is composed of three caste-like parts: the ruling class, made up of the aforementioned philosophers-kings (who are otherwise identified as having souls of gold); the auxiliaries of the ruling caste, made up of soldiers (whose souls are made up of silver), and whose job on the state is to force on the majority the order established by the philosophers; and the majority of the people (souls of either bronze or iron), who in contrast to the two first classes are allowed to own property and produce goods for themselves, but who are obliged to sustain with their own activities their rulers, who are forbade to own property.

The aristocratic man is better represented by Plato's brand of philosopher: a man whose intellect and body have been educated for years in a rigorous system based on gymnastics and contemplation of art, and whose soul has been made calm by learning the Truth based on the Platonic Ideas. Plato says of this philosopher that he is the ideal governor of any state precisely because his soul knows truths and has experienced realities that are more powerful and joyful than those pertaining to politics. Thus this man is not tempted to abuse power in his own advantage, and through his knowledge of the true virtues, he is able to model the citizens of his state into a good life.

In contrast to historical aristocracies, Plato's resembles a meritocracy of sorts. In it, a big government state keeps tracks of the innate character and natural skills of the citizens' children, and then directs them to the education that best suits those traits. In this manner, nothing would impede a child with a gold soul to be born to parents with silver, bronze or iron souls, and conversely, from parents with gold and silver souls, a child may be born with a bronze or an iron soul."
