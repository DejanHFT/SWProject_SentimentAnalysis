Do certain teachers work better with certain niches of students? Or is this just because I'm still learning?,ScythaScytha,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/sm19jb/do_certain_teachers_work_better_with_certain/,38,79," I'm in my fourth year of teaching, and I noticed I do better with and do worse with certain groups of students.

I found that I consistently have a large impact on boys that typically mess around in class (class clowns, talkative, high energy, etc.). I see this by their academic growth during the year, they generally say they like me, and they change some of their bad habits and add some good ones.

On the other end, I seem to do worse with quiet well behaved girls. There's been a few that are great to have in class, but for some reason, they don't make quite as much growth as they should, and we don't really have any rapport.

What do you guys think?"
