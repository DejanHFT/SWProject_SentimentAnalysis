Is using dreams as inspiration cheap or uncreative?,yeetmaster05,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/da4kyk/is_using_dreams_as_inspiration_cheap_or_uncreative/,32,20,"I always have wild dreams, a lot which give me cool character or plot or setting ideas. Is using these within stories kinda cheap? I almost feel like Iâ€™m cheating a bit when I do it

Thanks!"
