Friend [37/F] is about to be turned-down for a promotion she has dreamed of for years. I [36/F] know it's coming and don't know how to support her or what to do.,Ohlordnotfriday,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b47frm/friend_37f_is_about_to_be_turneddown_for_a/,265,2839,"Sorry, never posted here before and didn't know I needed a tl;dr (it is at the bottom). Reposting.

I  used to work on a small team for a division of a multinational company.  We used to primarily be staffed by what were called “old timers”  basically people who were close to being of a pensionable age who didn’t  want the hustle. That culture shifted and a lot of young blood has been  brought in. I formerly worked there and was given a lateral move out. A  colleague “Tina” still works there. Recently an opening for Director  came up and Tina came to me for help. She's been doing overtime and working hard to get noticed for this position. She's well qualified for it and has extensive experience at the company, so she was given a chance to interview for it.

Tina  is a single mother who has overcome poverty in childhood,  racists/bigots in the industry and worked hard to support her kids.  She’s had health issues but always fought hard. Tina is tenacious and  hardworking, but there are issues – she struggles in some areas and  while she’d definitely make a great director as she’s contentious, kind  and courteous, the role is evolving and may be a bit of a stretch.  Nonetheless, I helped her with her application and presentation. Beyond being colleagues, she and  I are friends; we spend a lot of time outside of work together (we’re  the only women of color in our respective areas) and share a lot of our  deep feelings and thoughts. She worked hard and put together a good  presentation. I was really proud of her. She presented this morning at  9:30 and got through it and was out by 10:00.

Most  of the other applicants were internal and interviewed yesterday but one  person was recommended by a senior VP in a different department. The  guy who was recommended is a 30-year-old hot-shot (I think he may actually be in his late twenties). He will soon graduate  from an Ivy League MBA and is the definition of corporate style. They  gave him a last-minute presentation slot immediately following Tina. I  attended all of the presentations (I am not on the hiring committee) but  was there to support Tina and see how the presentations went.

When  the hotshot gave his presentation, it wasn’t even close. The 20 of us  sat in the room and were dumbfounded. Not only was his presentation  visually appealing but he noticed details none of us ever did and he  developed a pitch that was so innovative that our AVP asked to use a tag  line he created. His technical analysis was so spot-on that it was  spooky. He understood issues facing our business unit without having to  be told and had ready solutions to solve the problems. Questions they  asked him were more about how he’ll do things *when*  he takes over the role. It was made very clear to him that this was his  job and they even provided an unofficial tentative start date. It is  very clear that he understands the industry and his past experiences,  such as professional work experience as well as winning top case  competitions and academic awards prepared him very well. The  presentations were in totally different leagues.

After  he finished, he made a self-deprecating joke and took questions. He  thanked us and left. We all sat there for a minute chatting when the AVP  very loudly told the HR director to offer significantly above the  salary and hammer-out a start date immediately and get a contract  signed. The VP who recommended him knew him from the MBA program as the  VP is a case coach there. He said he’d be his reference and they are  skipping all the formalities and going right to the offer.

Tina has no idea. She was so happy with her performance and she's *sure*  she nailed it. She did well, about as well as the other candidates, but  this guy is out-and-out in a different league. Just based on that I too  would hire the other guy. She's sitting on cloud 9 at her desk and  planning a celebratory dinner to celebrate her performance (she was told  decisions would be made in a couple of weeks). At this rate, it's  likely she'll be informed that she didn't get the job well before 5 PM.

I  really don't know what to do or say. If she asks, should I be honest  about this guy's presentation? Should I avoid her the rest of the day? I  want to support her, but have no idea how to even begin talking to her.

tl;dr Friend applied for a job she has worked towards for two years. She got proverbially destroyed in the interview but has no idea another candidate is going to get it. She's planning to celebrate tonight about her performance in the interview but will probably find out long before that she lost out. How can I support her?"
