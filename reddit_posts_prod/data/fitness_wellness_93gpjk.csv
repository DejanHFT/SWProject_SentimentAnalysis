Fitness Routine for aging well as I head into my 40's?,AugustanDyno,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/93gpjk/fitness_routine_for_aging_well_as_i_head_into_my/,15,5,"I'm heading towards my 40's (M), 5'9, 175lbs, decent shape. Eat alright, don't currently workout in a gym or with weights, but I play basketball once a week, hike and/or kayak a few times a month and basically just chase my kids around the rest of the time.

My job has me sitting behind a desk all day, and as I begin aging and heading closer to my 40's, I want to do my future self a favor and make sure I'm doing the right exercises so that my 40's and 50's and 60's will be a little easier.

Anyone have any advice for a good routine, not so much for bulking or making gains, but just for aging well.

\[Thanks for all the responses! Just the info I was looking for and need!\]"
