"Not everyone here is a bodybuilder, but this simple picture really motivates me to stay the course.",adam6923,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/o1cb7/not_everyone_here_is_a_bodybuilder_but_this/,90,75,"I was perusing through r/wallpapers the other day and came across this one of Arnie. It isn't his most famous pose or picture, but for some reason it gets me real jacked up. Motivation for me is a big mix of rage, anger, and hunger. Not just being your best, but trying to be the best. Anyway, thought other people might enjoy it as well.

Also, the picture is not hi-res or hi-def or hi-anything, it is kind of small, but even on a bigger resolution it still looks fine in my opinion."
