I'm not going to write up a huge story about my transformation because to be honest, there's really not much to it. I'd always been a skinny guy & I really wanted to accomplish something big, I wanted to become bigger & stronger (I also wanted some extra female attention, haha)  A few of my friends were already working out so I talked to them and started training in summer.

Starting Weight : 140 5'9

June 2012 http://imgur.com/a/AWcWp#0 (140 lbs)

This is when I decided to start working out, I started with the Starting Strength program (http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=998224), my diet was pretty bad & I was inconsistent (played a lot of video games!). My first year got me a good amount of gains though, my strength skyrocketted.

October 2013 http://imgur.com/a/AWcWp#1 (~158 lbs)

This is about the time I really figured out how to work out. My diet was much better, I was getting good sleep (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT) and my intensity was much higher. My initial ""working out"" phase had passed and I was now working out because I loved it, because it become a passion to me.

The grind kept going, I was loving my workouts. I had learned how to incorporate different training methods & exercises in to my workouts. I was making my own splits, adding in supersets, negative sets, pyramid sets and so much more.

Here I am now, obviously I've got some good lighting & filters on this but still, significant gains since the last picture. At this point training is just a part of my life, I train 6 times a week & I get bored when I don't train, just like my friend Eric, the gym is my playground & being there is just so much fun.



DIET

As someone who's always been on the skinny side, something I really had to change when I started working out was my diet. A lot of people don't understand how important your nutrition is when you work out. You NEED to hit your daily macros (calculated @ http://iifym.com/iifym-calculator/) or you won't see the full results. I spent more than a year working out with sub-par nutrition & I saw results, but they were much smaller than what they could have been.

These days, I usually have 5-6 meals a deal & I aim for ~170g of protein daily. My day usually starts off with 4-6 eggs, whole or just white, depends on how I feel and I'll have a glass of milk with that.

After that, I'll eat smaller meals every 2-3 hours, usually a combination of protein+carbs. Chicken/rice, Tuna/rice, Beef/sweet potatoes, you know what I mean. (chicken, tuna, beef, pork, turkey, salmon are all amazing and can taste really good if you know how to season & marinate!)

LIFTING, STATS & PROGRAM

I started off with a simple 3 day split program (Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe) and I ran that for about a month or two. After that, I did a lot of experimenting with different training methods/routines. I did hypertrophy for a while, endurance, went back to strength and now I like to mix it up a lot.

My first year wasn't really ""wasted"" but I really wish that I had done more research and known the things I know now.

These were my starting stats (JUNE 2012) (sets x reps x weight)

SQUAT : 4 x 12 x 95 lbs

BENCH : 4 x 12 x 75 lbs

DEADLIFT : 4 X 12 X 115


These are my current stats (JANUARY 2015) (sets x reps x weight)

SQUAT : 4 x 12 x 245 lbs

BENCH : 4 x 12 x 200 lbs

DEADLIFT : 4 x 12 x 275 LBS


ROUTINES

I've had so many routines that I can't really list them all but as I said, I started with the Starting Strength program (definitely check it out if you're new!) and right now I train 6 days a week.
