Is anti gravity technology possible?,rdkitchens,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/mfbft/is_anti_gravity_technology_possible/,12,10,"I just finished watching ""PBS Telescope - Hunting the Edge of Space - The Ever Expanding Universe.""  It said that the galaxies are * expanding in defiance of gravity and this is thought to be due to dark energy.  So I wondered, is anti gravity technology possible within the current understanding of the laws of physics?  Or would a better understanding of dark matter be required to answer that question?

Edit:  * The space between the galaxies is expanding."
