Why are the Nazis considered to be on the right wing of the political spectrum?  ,CalebTheWinner,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/gl90v/why_are_the_nazis_considered_to_be_on_the_right/,60,16,"I've wondered this from awhile, and I'd like a complicated answer. I'm a social studies ed major, and politically I'm on the left, so it's not that I have contempt for this label. I'm just wondering why they're considered to be on the right?

EDIT: Thanks for the ideas so far.  If anyone has any additional insight please feel free to post.  "
