I want buy an Astronomy Book,Skippy-Cracker,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/qp18po/i_want_buy_an_astronomy_book/,9,0,"Hello, I have been interested in astronomy for a long time now, and I want to buy myself a book that would teach me more. I found a book called Hyperspace: Our Final Frontier by John Gribbin but it was written/made in 2001. So I don't really know if this book is outdated or if it is still good to read. If it is outdated, does anyone know any book that is similar to that one, that has many pages and with some pictures and infographics. Thank You So Much In Advance!"
