"The Iron Giant was based on the premise ""What if a gun had a soul?""",ATiredCliche,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1cproy/the_iron_giant_was_based_on_the_premise_what_if_a/,424,2199,"On creative freedom from Wikipedia: The financial failure of Warner Bros.' previous animated effort, Quest for Camelot, whose cost overruns and production nightmares made the company reconsider their commitment to feature animation, helped shape The Iron Giant's production considerably. In a 2003 interview, writer Tim McCanlies recalled ""Quest for Camelot did so badly that everybody backed away from animation and fired people. Suddenly we had no executive anymore on Iron Giant, which was great because Brad got to make his movie. Because nobody was watching."" Bird, who regarded Camelot as ""trying to emulate the Disney style,"" attributed the creative freedom on The Iron Giant to the bad experience of Quest for Camelot, stating: ""I caught them at a very strange time, and in many ways a fortuitous time."" By the time The Iron Giant entered production, Warner Bros. informed the staff that there would be a smaller budget as well as time-frame to get the film completed. However, although the production was watched closely, Bird commented ""They did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good."" Bird regarded the tradeoff as having ""one-third of the money of a Disney or DreamWorks film, and half of the production schedule,"" but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as ""fully-made by the animation team; I don't think any other studio can say that to the level that we can.""

MORE COOL STUFF: Vin Diesel voiced the Iron Giant. Jennifer Aniston voiced Hogarth's mom. Eli Marienthal voiced Hogarth. Harry Connick, Jr. voiced Dean McCoppin, and Christopher McDonald voiced Kent Mansley.  **It is the highest-rated movie any of them were ever in**, according to RottenTomatoes.

The movie is hand-animated in 2D except for the giant, who is 3D and fully computer-animated to look like he was drawn.

By the way, Brad Bird also directed my two favorite Pixar films, The Incredibles and Ratatouille! so yeah guy pretty much owned my childhood

EDIT: whoa, unexpected upvotes! I posted this after watching the movie with my family last night. After about the seventh or eighth time I commented on the amazing CGI, art, and lighting direction, and then said that Iron Giant was a better critique of American Exceptionalism than Bioshock Infinite, my little brother who had never watched the movie before told me to shut up so he could actually enjoy it.
