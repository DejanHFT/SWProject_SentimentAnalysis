Should I give up or continue to be supportive?,toast778,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pc0eww/should_i_give_up_or_continue_to_be_supportive/,15,1,"
I’ve (26F) been together with my fiancé (27M) for 6 years. When we met he got me into working out, he was pretty fit, we talked all the time about our feelings and just spent quality time together. We were long distance for years and then had finally moved in together about three years ago. Since then he’s admitted that not only has his personality changed, but his whole lifestyle has too. 


He’s now lazier, doesn’t help vacuum or clean stuff without being prompted, is almost always zoning out on his phone, often doesn’t have comments or replies to me telling him my feelings or stories other than “hm”. I have to ask him if he heard me or has an actual response to what I’m saying. He’s just seemingly so bland now. We also only have sex like once a month. I’ve brought it up multiple times that this isn’t normal and that I feel like we’re just two roommates living together so I’ll try to initiate sex but it feels one sided. I also don’t really enjoy sex anymore.


I’ve had conversations with him too about his weight. He’s gained about 30 pounds in the last two years and I’ve admitted that it makes me less attracted to him and that I want him to healthy. I encourage him, and super nice about it and discuss how I want him to be healthy for himself and our future as a family. I’m always met with jokes like “I’ll never be better than I am now” or “I’m a pinnacle of health”. He even admitted that he just doesn’t want to diet or go to the gym and that he needs “a wake up call one day to change”. He also hasn’t seen a doctor and just deflects with jokes saying he’s “in the best shape of his life”. He recently told me he doesn’t want me to talk to him about his weight because it’s upsetting and he knows it’s an issue. 


His personal hygiene is also an issue. I keep getting on him about brushing his teeth at night and I get angry having to treat him like a child. He also doesn’t shave or trim himself at all anymore and his whole physical appearance is just such a big turn off. 


I don’t want to give up because he’s my best friend, we have a future and history together. But I feel like he’s changed so much and that I’m stupid for sticking around when I know he won’t change.


TL;DR fiancé of 6 years is overweight, doesn’t keep up with personal hygiene, doesn’t initiate sex anymore. Not sure if this relationship can be saved with me being supportive"
