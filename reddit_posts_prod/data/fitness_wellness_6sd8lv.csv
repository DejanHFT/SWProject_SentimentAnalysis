Training for a matharon as well as bulking?,GoodOldSnoopy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6sd8lv/training_for_a_matharon_as_well_as_bulking/,14,2,"So it's always been something I've wanted to do, run a marathon.

Height: 5'7
Weight: 150lbs

I'm around that, skinny but got a bit of stomach going on but I'm looking to bulk regardless. I want to put on some size and strength.

So all I'm really doing while training for the marathon is running the Nike+ Run Club app and their 8 week programme so essentially will be running a lot (obviously).

Could I then, just keep track of how many calories I've burned while running on the treadmill, up my calorie intake by that amount and then keep my bulk going? That way I essentially won't burn off too many calories from running and will have enough to still keep up with my PPL split.

Or is there more to what I'm thinking?"
