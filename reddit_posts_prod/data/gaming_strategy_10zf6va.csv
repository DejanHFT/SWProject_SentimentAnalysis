Really no grand strategy games set in the 21st century?,Sheetmusicman94,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10zf6va/really_no_grand_strategy_games_set_in_the_21st/,10,4," Hi gamers, are there really no grand strategy games (like Europa Universalis, Hearts of Iron or Civlilization) that are set in the 21st century, or **at least after the 1990s**? I would like a realistic strategy video game with modern states and environment.  
I just spent 20 minutes with ChatGPT and it just found these ones, and I think it halucinates the expansions. Or at least none of these games are exclusive (or mainly based in my desired era). Any advice?

Here are the grand strategy games from the list I provided that are set in the 21st or 22nd century or have events after World War II:

1. Hearts of Iron IV (2016) - set during World War II and allows players to continue playing into the Cold War and beyond, with detailed tech trees, politics system, and military management, allowing players to customize and lead any nation.
2. Victoria II (2010) - set in the 19th century but has expansions that allow players to continue playing into the 20th century, covering major historical events such as the World Wars, the Russian Revolution, and the Cold War.
3. Stellaris (2016) - set in the far future with events and technology inspired by the 20th century, featuring a detailed empire management system, diplomacy, and warfare.
4. Crusader Kings III (2020) - set in the medieval era but with expansions that allow players to continue playing into the 21st century, with dynasty management, character interactions, and political intrigue, allowing players to lead a royal dynasty through the centuries.
5. Europa Universalis IV (2013) - set from 1444 to 1821, but with expansions that allow players to continue playing into the 21st century, with detailed empire management, diplomacy, and warfare.
6. Civilization VI (2016) - a turn-based grand strategy game that spans from the ancient era to the modern era, with emphasis on cultural, scientific, and military victory conditions, allowing players to lead any nation into the 21st century and beyond.
7. Total War: Three Kingdoms (2019) - set in ancient China but based on the historical events of the Three Kingdoms period (220-280 AD), featuring detailed diplomacy, battles, and empire management, but not set in the 21st century or later.
8. Imperator: Rome (2019) - set during the rise of the Roman Republic and the ensuing conflicts in the Mediterranean, featuring empire management, politics, and warfare, but not set in the 21st century or later.
9. Total War: Warhammer II (2017) - a fantasy grand strategy game that includes races from the Warhammer universe, detailed battles, and empire management, but not set in the 21st century or later.
10. Crusader Kings II (2012) - set in the medieval era with dynasty management, character interactions, and political intrigue, allowing players to lead a royal dynasty through the centuries, but not set in the 21st century or later."
