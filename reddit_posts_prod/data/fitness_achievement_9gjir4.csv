How will programs like 5/3/1 BTM achieve body balance?,Krotanix,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9gjir4/how_will_programs_like_531_btm_achieve_body/,23,0,"I've been out of the gym for some years after having commited for about 8 years straight. I ended having a clean, muscular and balance physique. Now of course it's all gone.

Checking the Wiki's recommended programs like 5/3/1 - Building the Monolith, I've come to think they are kind of unbalanced, focusing on some body parts and forgetting others.

This workout in particular seems to totally forget about abs, hamstrings and calves. I understand it's recommended for beginners, but this isn't going to build a good strength base on those bodyparts for more advanced plans. I get deadlifts and squats work on hamstrings, but they won't grow as much as quads, for example.

**I'm by no means saying this is a bad program**. I just want to know why it's considered good. My POV and main focus is aesthetics, with the secondary objective of gaining strength."
