Intrinsic Motivation,LauraLew,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2smmsq/intrinsic_motivation/,25,3,"Good morning!! Y'all have any good tips for long term self-motivation? I've started so many things many different times and it doesn't seem to stick except for eating right.  I like when I have someone to motivate (someone working out with me) because that motivates me, but it's hard to find that person that will stick with me or be on the same level with me (I need fitness friends!! :]). At the moment, my goals are to get my endurance up, to not be so jiggly, and to be strong. I am a mom of 3, 5'1"", 130lb and a full time student, if that helps at all :) Thanks in advance!!    "
