"What’s your favourite movie score and why is it Ennio Morricone’s from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly?",masoudloveskimberly,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/kiffga/whats_your_favourite_movie_score_and_why_is_it/,91,56,"If i’m being honest, a lot of the time i don’t really “notice” the score of a film, (been trying to be more attentive recently) i usually just vibe with it, so i can never really critique it. Oh but how noticeable TGTBATU’s score was!! i plan on watching MANY more films on top of the several i’ve already seen, but i truly doubt i’ll ever feel what i felt when i heard “The Story of A Soldier” play in that prison camp. so mesmerising."
