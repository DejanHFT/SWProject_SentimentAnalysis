ways I can improve my designs and be more creative,charsuniverse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/1375995/ways_i_can_improve_my_designs_and_be_more_creative/,14,5,"I feel like I'm stagnated on my design quality and creativity. I'm repeating patterns, making basic layouts... often I feel like nothing I do is good enough. 

What can I do to improve?

Are there advanced courses that skip the whole ""How to make a star on illustrator""? Maybe some design challenges? Any suggestions are welcome. 

I posted a similar question on r/learndesign but wanted some insights from this sub."
