A brief essay on Nihilism in 21st century America,pointlessprofiIe,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1n4w5k/a_brief_essay_on_nihilism_in_21st_century_america/,10,0,"As all people begin to come of age, they at some point ask themselves, “What the hell is this all about?  Why are we here? Is there any purpose for me in this world?”  Most will find solace in careers, some in religion, some in politics, others in addictions, and some others will never find an answer. But with any of these options, the user, if they look close enough, will find that the void that they have tried to fill is still there; it will always be there.  There is possibly, and quite probably, nothing to fill the Void, as it is as endless as the human imagination; because that’s really where the problem is.  The Void isn’t some intrinsic hole left in us; it IS our own imagination.  As long as we can imagine more, there will always be a void left in the pit of our souls.  
So what is one to do?  American culture has plenty of answers.  “Watch TV!”, “Play Video Games!”, “Find Jesus”, “Buy Stuff!”, and though not advertised, “Get drunk or high!”.  All of these solutions certainly can do a fine job; they will distract the individual to the overwhelming emptiness they feel, and temporarily make the individual feel better, but do nothing to fill the Void; these are forms of masturbation.  Now don’t get me wrong, masturbation is great… to a degree, it can obviously be over-done, as any 12 year-old boy can tell you.  And in this society, it is being done ad nauseam.  I dare you to walk the streets and find one teen that isn't walking around with their face buried in their respective intelligent device.  And the adults just as bad… if you are in, or anyone you know is in the fast-food industry, ask them how many people come to the drive through window yakking away on their cell phones… never even speaking to the people that give them their food, I’d wager it’s on the order of 70%, as I used to work in the food industry.  This is not just ridiculous; it’s dangerous… and even then not just to our public safety with driving hazards, but for the entire foundation of our society.  They all walk around mumbling stuff so unimportant into their cellphones because they are all so terrified of having to look a stranger in the face and seeing the same look of shame countenanced upon them.  Everyone knows there’s something wrong with this society but no one ever does anything.  
But what is wrong with our society?  People don’t talk to each other anymore, the internet can be such a cold and cruel place that it causes kids to commit suicide, our government is in economic turmoil and every other week there’s a mass shooting or something somewhere…fuck what isn't wrong with our society.  So who’s the culprit; cell phones, video games, guns… WRONG, these are masturbation; these are the symptoms of the problem not the problem itself.  While none of these things are a truly positive aspect of our society, they aren’t responsible for running it into the ground. Cell phones themselves are intended for positive use, though the user can start playing “Words with Friends” at any time so that’s a crapshoot. On-line shooter games are a popular target for those that are anti-gun.  But if anything it gives kids an outlet to vent themselves without physical violence so if anything it can have a positive effect on society.  The Internet can be a pretty nasty place, but if the things said to someone online make them want to kill themselves, they never would have stood a chance at actual human interaction anyway. Which is not giving free reign on all you trolls out there, sure you may chuckle to yourself but it’s not worth the boredom you put everyone else through.  It’s true guns kill a lot of people, but guns require maniacs behind them.  Granted it would be a lot more difficult for those maniacs to mow down 50 people if they didn’t have such ease at acquiring the guns in the first place.  A lot of you may be screaming “Religion!”, and you are right to an effect.   But remember, religion has been there a lot longer than the ole US of A.  If anything, America’s a thorn in religion’s side.  But none-the-less religion is holding this country back; stifling scientific progress and hijacking politics.  It is time for the old guard to realize that it’s time to change and let science and reason take its place.
Let’s take a closer look at the surge of mass shootings that are plaguing the country now days.  What causes these kids to want to kill as many people as possible before they themselves are brought down by the police?  “Oh, they are just crazy people.  It’s just unfortunate that they chose to do such awful things.”, some might say. But there’s something different about these young men.  There’ve been crazy people all through time and for the last 50 years they’ve had the ability to pull off mass shootings, yet we’ve only seen a surge like this in the last 10 or 15 years.  They obviously do not value their own lives but they obviously see no value in any life.  These are men who have looked deep into the Void and understood that life has no inherent value and that there is no purpose here for anyone.  “He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you.” (Nietzsche) These men became nihilists by accepting the Void for what it was, and when the ennui they encountered mingled with their own suicidal and unhinged minds they applied their philosophy to everyone they could by force.
Why is nihilism a new occurrence?  Nihilism is nothing new.  There have been plenty of well-educated individuals in history who were, upon closer inspection, at heart nihilists.  What is new is the number of children becoming nihilists at a young age, perhaps permanently skewing their world view.  The problem is education without application.  This country has made education of its youth a priority for over 100 years; providing it for all, education has raised living standards and created many great minds.  With the internet, now a high level of education is available to anyone with access to a computer or smartphone as the entirety of human understanding is just a mouse click away.  This was great and it’s what made America a super-power, the problem now is the world is changing.  More and more menial jobs are being outsourced and intensive jobs are increasingly being mechanized.  This is leaving an entire generation with little hope of a job outside of the service industry regardless of their education level.  Now we have a generation who is overeducated and underutilized.  This leads to a general malaise in society and increases the exposure to the Void for millions of youth.  “There are times, however, and this is one of them, when even being right feels wrong. What do you say, for instance, about a generation that has been taught that rain is poison and sex is death? If making love might be fatal and if a cool spring breeze on any summer afternoon can turn a crystal blue lake into a puddle of black poison right in front of your eyes, there is not much left except TV and relentless masturbation. It's a strange world. Some people get rich and others eat shit and die.” (Hunter S. Thompson).  This is what is wrong with this country.  This is why we are such chronic masturbators.
 When one contemplates the things that we distract ourselves with, it becomes apparent that we are all engaging in self-destruction.  We are alive but not living; we’re just killing time until the next day until finally we are old and gray and never really lived.  And then it’s not a huge leap to see why these young men want to die and by being unbalanced want to take everyone with them.  And when a large chunk of a society goes on autopilot like this, it’s not hard to see why no one talks to each other anymore and the economy is failing.  Any hope in repairing the damage that’s been done lays in giving people something to do.  The country is American “idle”, they are waiting.  They need a national project, something that they can set their imaginations free on, the Void will begin to fade into the distance and everyone in society can be much happier.
