I am planning to travel to Iceland in March to hopefully catch some northern lights action. I, of course, want to do some (moderate) hiking and take a dip in the blue lagoon as well. Iâ€™ve seen a lot of packages where they will bus you from the hostel (Loft) they look interesting. I just wanted to see if anyone has done these and has strong feelings towards whether they were worth it or not. Any information in appreciated! Thank you!!"
