“Kingdom of Heaven: Director’s Cut” (2005),thedarkknight16_,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/z47g1c/kingdom_of_heaven_directors_cut_2005/,82,153,"I had never heard of this movie until seeing it lauded on this subreddit. People would emphasize the importance of watching the director’s cut, not just the theatrical. Hmm, good cast, director, many Reddit opinions, I added this film to my watchlist and it sat there for a long time.

I have now just watched this film.

Wow.

This was a banger, an “epic” in the true sense.

Orlando Bloom plays Balian, who after the loss of his wife, finds his seeking out redemption in Jerusalem and the politics that lie there. He learns what it means to be a knight.

I was expecting a lopsided depiction of events, as Hollywood does as usual. But I thought Ridley Scott did a fair job in displaying this historical event, from all sides. There were some issues/critiques of course, but I can respect the effort Ridley Scott made. It’s only a shame that there are not more epic films made like this: powerful, moving, grandiose, large action, meaningful, spiritual, historical, well acted, shot and soundtracked.

Despite any flaws, this film was a 10/10 for me because of the art of filmmaking that went into this movie. The details and precision could be felt. It had a meaningful journey that was depicted really well, the writing/dialogue was superb."
