Advice for finding inspiration?,HowToTakeALife,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/r2uzfj/advice_for_finding_inspiration/,9,2,"What do you guys do when you feel the urge to write but can't come up with anything?

I'm a very emotional writer. I mostly write poetry right now. Normally, I write about things I'm feeling or have felt in the past. Sometimes I feel strong emotions I want to express through my writing, but the words just don't come to me.

Most of the time, writing prompts don't really inspire me in any way. 

I'm just wondering what you guys do to get out of this. Any advice?"
