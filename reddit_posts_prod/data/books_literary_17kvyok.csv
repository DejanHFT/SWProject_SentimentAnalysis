"Is there a literary equivalent to ""outsider art""?",zzzzzzzzzra,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17kvyok/is_there_a_literary_equivalent_to_outsider_art/,108,98,"Think people like Henry Darger who, I believe, was schizophrenic and wrote a bizarre, meandering novel thousands of pages long as well as creating amateur visual art. I'm talking unconventional books with either unconventional authors (neurodivergent, etc.) or weird backstories or books that are conventionally bad but interesting/entertaining for some reason (like a literary equivalent of 'The Room' by Tommy Wisseau). I don't just mean weird/experiemental books like Finnegans Wake by mostly normal/educated authors.

I probably would also include ""The House Without Windows"" by Barbara Newhall Follett which is a strange but well written novel by a nine-year-old girl prodigy who later disappeared without a trace. She wasn't necessarily ""weird"" but her backstory is very bizarre and so is the book."
