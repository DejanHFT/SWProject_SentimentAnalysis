Do you write only when inspired?,Ilovestraightpepper,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/12zcn2g/do_you_write_only_when_inspired/,18,7,"I’m working my way towards making writing a habit and sitting down and doing it no matter how I feel. But, I can’t help but feel like my writing when I’m feeling inspired, fired up, etc. is just better and snappier when I feel inspired. But then isn’t it necessary sometimes to churn it out no matter how we feel?

Edit: thank you all so much! I get it now. I have to get my butt in chair, butt in chair, butt in chair and the inspiration will come the more I do it. This was the ass kick I needed. Thanks again folks."
