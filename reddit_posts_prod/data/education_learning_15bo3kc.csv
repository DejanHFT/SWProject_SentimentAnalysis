"Barbara Oakley, a leader in the field of learning, used her class to spread right-wing sentiment. Should we be concerned?",AltRumination,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/15bo3kc/barbara_oakley_a_leader_in_the_field_of_learning/,3,0,"Barbara Oakley, a prominent researcher in the field of learning, recently wrote a critique of Noam Chomsky and then sent it to a million of her students who have taken her MOOC class.  The critique included a link to the New Criterion, a right-wing website with strong conservative views.  Oakley apparently leans right.

Does this trouble anyone?  Isn’t conservatism the antithesis of learning and education?

What’s sad is to realize that no matter how deceitful or duplicitous their researchers can get, major universities tend to whistle and look the other way.
