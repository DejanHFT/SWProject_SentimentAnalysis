"Going to italy with my partner, have 4 days to travel alone, do I explore more of Italy or check out neighboring countries?",Any_Issue3003,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18rrrmo/going_to_italy_with_my_partner_have_4_days_to/,21,3,"Hey there guys, I am going to be traveling to Italy around the 4th of january. During this trip I will have 4 days to travel on my own because my partner is going for a work thing, so we are going a week earlier and I will be there for 4 days alone. Do you think it would be better to explore more of Italy and look into cool attractions/ restaurants, or should I go to a neighboring country and check out like Vienna or something? Like other than that what places in Italy do you think are worth going? The current plan is fly into Rome, check out some stuff for a few days, then go to Venice which is where his work thing is. Should I go to like Florence OR tuscany, or should I go to a neighboring country? Please let me know I appreciate everything every tip and all of that. This is my first time traveling outside of the United states. I love to travel as I have been to 30 of the 50 states, but this is my first time going abroad. Thank you for all of your help and I hope you have a great day and happy new year!"
