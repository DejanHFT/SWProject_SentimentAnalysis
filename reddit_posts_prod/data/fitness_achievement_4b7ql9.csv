What can you do or have done fitness wise that puts you at the top 1%?,joeanonalt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4b7ql9/what_can_you_do_or_have_done_fitness_wise_that/,2317,1415,"I recently achieved my life goal of doing 20 pull ups.  I mentioned this to a friend who then said I'm in the top 1% (not really sure how valid this is).  Never did I thought I would be able to achieve being in the top 1% for anything. So I want to pose this question to /r/fitness, what can you do or have done fitness wise that puts you at the top 1%?

Edit: Thanks for the all the amazing posts.  I tried reading all of the accomplishments and upvoting everyone.  Some of them are really amazing.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Edit: Can't believe the posts are still coming in.  Spending way too much time reading them all.  You guys and gals have done some amazing stuff.  It's a shame how if anyone had posted these individually it'll get downvoted to oblivion.  It's apparent people like to share their accomplishments but can't because some people would view it as bragging."
