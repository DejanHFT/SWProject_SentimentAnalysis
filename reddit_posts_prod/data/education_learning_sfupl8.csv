Learn philosophy,greece666,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/sfupl8/learn_philosophy/,3,19,"Hello, this post is for those of you who want to read and discuss philosophy.

We are a group of avid philosophy readers and organize weekly, in depth readings. No prior knowledge is required. We proceed slowly, just a few pages per week. Meetings are weekly and last 90 minutes each.

Current groups include: Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling, Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil, Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, Stirner's The Unique and its Property and many more.

This project started more than a year ago and it's entirely free to participate. You can join us here: https://discord.gg/xDj2WM75Vd"
