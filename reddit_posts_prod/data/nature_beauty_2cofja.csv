Please Help Save This Beautiful Island From Being Destroyed By The Barclay Brothers!!,NothingtobeDon3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nature/comments/2cofja/please_help_save_this_beautiful_island_from_being/,8,42,"Reddit! Together we can save this tiny island of 600 people!

For the benefit of those who don't know where or what Sark is, imagine Hobbiton and you're 95% of the way there. 

There are no cars, only bicycles and horse+carts for transport - the natural beauty of the island is astounding. There's a really cute little bridge linking to the adjacent island (Little Sark). Everyone speaks English and some of the older generations speak Sercquiais (Sark-French - it's like Scottish is to English). There are no policemen because everybody is so nice there's no crime - you get the idea.

It is a British Crown Dependancy (like Gibraltar and the Isle of Man) and the population are lovely folk. Sark is so small, only 2 square miles in size, and The Barclay Brothers are threatening to just, buy everything on it and have a complete monopoly over the people who live there - prices of all their goods, imports, etc, so that they can avoid paying UK tax!

The last time these bankers bought an island they had a huge gothic castle built on it and that's really the antithesis of what Sark is about.




**tl;dr** - Sark is a place of peace, pubs, ice cream, horse&cart, fields, nature, scenery, views, rock pools, and community.

Please please help us save it by signing the petition below.
