MILESTONE ACHIEVED! 4 plate squat,MakwaMarty,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3qh0v1/milestone_achieved_4_plate_squat/,38,96,"BW: 201 - After a year of hypertrophy and mobility training, I finally went back o 5/3/1 and achieved the 4 plate squat! It was a grind and it's not pretty, but the bar went up. SO STOKED! I just wanted to share this with someone, thanks.
