Music Melody Help (Two song comparison),PianistPitiful5714,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/ymhe5p/music_melody_help_two_song_comparison/,4,0,"Hi r/music,

This is my first time here, so please tell me if I'm in the wrong place and where to go.  I'm having a disagreement with a few friends, in fact, it's sparking a bit of a 'the dress' moment for us, where some hear it and some don't.  The song ""Uplift"" by Vixy and Tony, to me, has an extreme similarity to ""Come as You Are"" by Nirvana.  I love both songs, but I do not have the music knowledge to express what is similar about them.  I said 'tune' and was told no, not at all.  So can anyone help?  Why do these two songs seem so similar to me?
