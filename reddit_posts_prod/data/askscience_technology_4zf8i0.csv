What is the fastest possible probe we could send to Proxima Centauri using today's technology or technology attainable within the next few years?,bamdastard,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4zf8i0/what_is_the_fastest_possible_probe_we_could_send/,54,66,"The news of a planet in the habitable zone of proxima centari got me thinking. If we wanted to send a probe there to do a flyby how long would it take? if we wanted it to stop, how long would that take?
I assume an ion thruster or resonant cavity thruster would probably be the fastest. 

the fastest current probe out there is Juno, which is traveling at 25 miles per second. if juno were pointed in the right direction it would take a while:

((((2.4943e+13 / 25) / 60) / 60) /24)/365 = 31,000 years
a ion thruster could accelerate for half the journey, or more then use additional thruster fuel to slow down.
What is the fastest theoretical span of time we could get something there to send back some photos?
