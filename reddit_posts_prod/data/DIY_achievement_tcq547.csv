Help with subfloor removal? It's so hardly bound to concrete that mechanical removal ends up removing concrete too!.,gibagger,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/tcq547/help_with_subfloor_removal_its_so_hardly_bound_to/,109,485,"Hi everyone!,

I would like to remove a wooden floor from my house. The wood is in bad shape, and it's glued to a MDF subfloor. The MDF subfloor is, in turn, glued to the concrete floor. 

The problem is that the MDF is glued so strongly that removing the glue ends up bringing a layer of concrete along with it. This means that the concrete will be damaged, which is not a desirable outcome, and also that the process will be extremely slow.

I have tried with a crowbar and a hammer. I thought it would be easier at the beginning, but this definitely turned out not to be the case at all. 

Upon doing some research, it seems like there are two ways I could go about it:

1. Chemical solvents. Soak up the MDF with the chemical solvent in hopes that it loosens up the glue, then proceed with mechanical removal.
2. Using a multitool with a scraper attachment. This would be extremely slow, since the scraper attachment is quite small and we're talking about 50 squared meters or so.

Any ideas on how to achieve this relatively efficiently? It's fine if it takes a few days, or I end up buying or renting tools.

Here are some images of what I am talking about: [https://imgur.com/a/Equ0RQy](https://imgur.com/a/Equ0RQy)

Thanks all!"
