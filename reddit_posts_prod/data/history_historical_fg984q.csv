"Historically, is it common to send bodyguard units into actual field battles?",EvangelosKamikaze,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/fg984q/historically_is_it_common_to_send_bodyguard_units/,227,3058,"In strategy games, any kind of royal bodyguard (like Varangian Guards or Praetorians) has traditionally been portrayed as top-tier infantry when deployed on the battlefield.

And yet, at least historically, are royal guard units sent out into open battle often (when the monarch is not personally taking the field)? And if so, can non-monarch generals field them irl? Are they 'granted' to important members of the state too? Can the retinue of one lord be tasked with protecting another, and how does that work?

And is there a reason, aside from equipment, why they should be considered so elite? Guard duty (which puts you by yourself or in small squads) is different from fighting in formation after all, and time spent guarding the palace is time spent outside of active battle. Skill-wise it's possible that elite imperial guards are inferior to seasoned regular veterans.

So what do we know about royal bodyguards and their quality, purpose, and strategic and tactical roles?

**Edit:** *The scenarios under discussion obviously do not include when the monarch themselves is on the field, since it's pretty obvious that the house retinues of medieval rulers, or Alexander's companion cavalry etc will follow them into battle. Rather, the discussion is intended to be about how royal bodyguard units are deployed when the monarch is not on campaign.*"
