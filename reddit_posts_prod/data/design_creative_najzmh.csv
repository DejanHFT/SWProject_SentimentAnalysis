"What do you think about when I say the word ""creativity""?",MinimumSuggestion698,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/najzmh/what_do_you_think_about_when_i_say_the_word/,4,1,"Hi folks, I know it's a bit of a strange question, but what particular object(s) comes to mind when I say the word ""creativity"". Some friends said palette and brush, or rainbow, or blank paper and pencil, what about you?   
I'm asking this question because I'm looking for inspiration for a personal work of mine, and I would like to represent the creativity concept in one single object.   
Stay creative! :D"
