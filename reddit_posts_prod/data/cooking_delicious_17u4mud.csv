"favorite delicious, and most importantly meal-preppable vegetable side dishes?",whatisfoolycooly,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/17u4mud/favorite_delicious_and_most_importantly/,4,2,"I love cooking and have been upping my game a lot recently, trying a bunch of new recipes, but as a busy uni student living on his own, I never really make any sides for my meals, and as a result probably consume WAAYY less vegetables than I should, as they rarely are the focal points of any interesting new recipes I find. 

Dishes that keep well and can be easily reheated would be ideal, especially those tasty enough to eaten alone (or with bread or something) in a pinch, as takeout lunches are a no-go price wise in the city I study in. >!I was initially thinking Indian vegetable curries might be a good way to solve this, but I feel like they are usually more of a main dish and too fatty or starchy to eat as a healthy side!<

So for any other busy single people out there, how do you tackle the vegetable problem?"
