"Fast, cheap, easy, delicious homemade American Cheese",DangerouslyUnstable,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/14xrxsh/fast_cheap_easy_delicious_homemade_american_cheese/,6,3,"For the right application, I'm a big fan of American cheese. It's fantastic on a burger and you can't quite match the gooeyness of Mac and Cheese with American cheese in it. But I will admit to being a slight snob and I generally only buy the Boar's Head/deli counter American Cheese (for the haters out there, that's the stuff that is actually made from nearly 100% cheese). I have no problem if you like the stuff made primarily from milk, or even the vegetable oil stuff, but I personally have stuck to my Boar's Head. The problem is, it's _expensive_. Nearly $12/pound where I live. I noticed a while back that even high quality extra sharp Cheddar is less than $8/pound, and I knew that American cheese was really just Cheddar (or sometimes Colby) with sodium citrate to help it emulsify and give it the gooeyness it's known for, so I decided to try to make it on my own.

I started with [this recipe](https://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Perfectly-Melting-Cheese-Slice/) from Saveur, but I decided to stick with just extra sharp Cheddar (where I live, the easiest to find good stuff is Tillamook). 

Other than that, I stuck to the directions exactly.

Oh my god. It was incredibly easy, it went pretty fast, it tasted better than the boar's head, and it was cheaper to boot. I ended up making a few batches and vacuum sealing the in the freezer since I don't actually use American cheese all that often.

This is probably not worth it if you aren't going to enjoy the process of making it (although that's almost true for anything that's home made), but for me, this is on the list with mayo for things I will never again buy from the store.

The recipe I did (adapted from the link above):

1/2 cup water  
14 g Sodium Citrate  
380 g extra sharp cheddar, grated  

1. Heat your oven to it's lowest setting and put a rimmed baking tray in to warm  
Add water and sodium citrate to small pot and bring to a simmer.   
2. Slowly add the cheese in batches, whisking (or an immersion blender if you are making a large enough batch/it's deep enough to not spatter) until it has melted and is smooth  
3. Once all the cheese is integrated, take the tray out and pour the melted cheese over the tray. If the tray is not warm enough, it will cool too quickly and will end up thicker than ideal (for slices), if you are going to make something like Mac and Cheese where slices don't matter, just go ahead and use the melted cheese as is, and skip the tray step.

I had it on smash burgers and can't wait to use it next."
