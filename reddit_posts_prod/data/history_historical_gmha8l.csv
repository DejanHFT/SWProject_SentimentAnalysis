What are some historical battles that shouldn't have been won - where the side with better strategy/planning/numbers still lost?,AnguisMors,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/gmha8l/what_are_some_historical_battles_that_shouldnt/,1166,4208,"I'm not talking about underdogs here, there are plenty of examples of underdogs (who usually win because of superior strategy), I'm talking about battles where one side clearly should have won and it's nearly unbelievable that they didn't. I'm also not looking for examples of the [Empty Fort Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_Fort_Strategy), because that is actual good strategy in some circumstances. I'm purely looking for examples of dumb luck or seeming divine intervention.

Edit: Sorry if my responses take a while, it takes some time to look into the replies if some context/explanation isn't included.

Edit2: So, I've realized that this question is very difficult to answer because armies very rarely win on dumb luck, and if they do, they probably lie about what happened to look like it was their plan all along to look good historically. I'm still enjoying all the battle stories though."
