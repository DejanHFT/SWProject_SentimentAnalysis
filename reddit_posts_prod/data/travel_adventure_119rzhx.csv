"Island of Adventure vs Magic Kingdom, Orlando?",parul99,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/119rzhx/island_of_adventure_vs_magic_kingdom_orlando/,6,2,"My partner and I will be in orlando for a day and want to go to one of these parks. I am confused because we have already visited Universal Studios Hollywood so i am worried the experience will be the same at another Universal Park as well. However, we also feel that as adults we might not enjoy disney that much because itâ€™s a park more focused towards children. Any experiences/recommendations welcome!"
