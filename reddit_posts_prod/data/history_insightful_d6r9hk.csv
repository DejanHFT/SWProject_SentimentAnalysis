So the House of Vasa fought on two different sides (Poland/Sweden) during the 30 Years War but there doesn't seem to be much on this internal conflict on the internet. Does anyone have any insight into this interesting family dynamic?,MansaQu,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/d6r9hk/so_the_house_of_vasa_fought_on_two_different/,15,14,"Well, the title basically. Gustav Adolph of Sweden fought as one leading forces of the protestant, anti-imperial front and Sigismund III of Poland supported the Habsburg coalition. How did this family split happen? Are there any specific examples (events, documents, letters, battles, campaigns etc.) of this conflict taking place? Are there any primary sources? Did the conflict continue after 1648? Its just fascinating that one of the most influencial European houses was divided and I would love to learn more about this.

Thanks."
