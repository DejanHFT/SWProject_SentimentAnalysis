"In middle school, I was given some kind of learning test and want to know what it's called.",UniversalPilot,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/18kyize/in_middle_school_i_was_given_some_kind_of/,8,8,"This would've been around 20 years ago, and I did get diagnosed with ADHD-I for which I took medicine (this was a while after the tests.)

In either sixth or seventh grade I was called out of class by a member of faculty (not a teacher, I don't think?) and was given a series of short tests/assessments. It's been too long for me to recall every one but these are what I remember:

- Shown an picture of arranged shapes to memorize and recreate with patterned blocks

- Asked to spell and define various words, like 'sovereign' 

- Given a set of words at the beginning, to recall later

Fwiw I have a congenital disorder that is commonly associated with learning disabilities, especially dyscalculia. I was never diagnosed with anything like that though and do fine with numbers. 

I assume the tests were just to assess me for a learning disability but I'm wondering if this is a common thing for a school to do and what the name or term for the tests might be, if there is one. I've tried Googling but can't seem to find what I'm looking for. 

Thank you in advance for any help."
