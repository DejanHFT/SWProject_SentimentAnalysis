Space Battle with Today's Technology?,samiam762,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/masdg/space_battle_with_todays_technology/,14,4,"I was rereading Ender's Game, and I started thinking about what would happen if, today, an alien species attacked us (a la the Buggers). Would we just be completely overwhelmed? Do we have any weaponized systems that could stand a chance, or would we be able to build anything in time? I assume the alien civilization would be far more advanced than us."
