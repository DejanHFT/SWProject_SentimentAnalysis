In-House Creative Team Hierarchy?,victoirerising,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/ann2an/inhouse_creative_team_hierarchy/,3,1,"I run our in-house creative team in tandem with a team lead partner and we report to the Marketing Director. I was pushing for more traditional titles for the team and she tasked me with doing some research on other internal design team's hierarchy and title structure to get an idea of what's standard.

She seems to think the traditional Creative Director > Art Director > Designers/Production applies more to agencies and in-house teams are structured differently. This hasn't been my experience but 1) I could be wrong and 2) I'd like some data to support whichever one of us is right.

Please, share your team structure and why you think it works/doesn't work well."
