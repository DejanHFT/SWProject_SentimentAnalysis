"Besides Lisbon and Porto, what’s the best areas to explore in Portugal?",Sea-Vehicle-1951,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1937uke/besides_lisbon_and_porto_whats_the_best_areas_to/,57,9,"Hi guys! I am planning a Portugal trip (honeymoon, sort of) in Sept/October. Besides Lisbon and Porto, what’s another city/area I should add to the trip? I only have 12 nights in total and generally prefer traveling at a slower pace and getting to know a place well. 

Also, is it true that it’s difficult to travel with luggages in Portugal? Can I even bring a luggage on the train…?

Any advice would be appreciated :)"
