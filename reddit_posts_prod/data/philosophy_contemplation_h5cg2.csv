"Probability, inevitability, and immortality: mathematically speaking, will we re-incarnate?",septicman,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/h5cg2/probability_inevitability_and_immortality/,28,6,"I haven't studied (nor understand very well) probability or the kind of mathematics needed to answer (or maybe even accurately pose) this question, but my fumbling research has just gotten me lost in long numbers, Greek symbols and way too many this^thats.  So, I'm steeling myself, admitting I'm not all that smart, and throwing it out there on /r/philosophy. :-P


My question is: **if something has a more than zero chance of being probable, then given a long enough period of time, is it inevitable?**


Why I'm not putting this in /r/maths or somesuch is my reason for posing it in the first place.  That is, if the answer to the above is 'Yes', then can I expect to be sitting more or less right here in sixty squillion trillion years doing exactly what I'm doing now?


'cos after I die, and my body rots and is distributed amongst the earthworms and earwigs and bombardier beetles, and eventually becomes trees and stars and blu-ray players etc, I'm not ever going to exist again, because the chances of all those atoms that constituted me will never come together in exactly the right structure ever again, right?


But as infinitesimally small as the chances of that happening ever again *are*, over an infinite period of time, does such an occurrence becomes inevitable?


I may be falling victim to the roulette fallacy -- i.e. the more times a roulette wheel delivers a black number, the chances of a red number occurring increase (which they don't; it's always 50/50) -- but the nature of *infinity* has me contemplating this.  Over an unending duration, are not all things possible?  Probable?  Inevitable?


**TL; DR:** Too bad, piss off to /r/pics :-P
