Trying to achieve a 315 LB bench press,I_Flunked_English,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/34td7z/trying_to_achieve_a_315_lb_bench_press/,31,8,"First of all, thanks to all you reddit fitness folks!  I have been out of the gym for a decade, and this sub finally got me back in.

My background, I am 34 years old, 5'9"" and 200 LBS.  In high school and college I played soccer on a very competitive level and lifted weights regularly.  My max bench press at 21 y/o was 250 LBS.  Since college I have continued to play soccer and stayed in shape, but I have neglected the weights.  

My motivation/reason for the 315 Bench.  I now have two young daughters, 1 and 3.  One day soon, they will bring some pimply, stinky, long haired, hippy looking dude by and ask for permission to go get groped (maybe just a movie).  I would like to be able to make him consider his life choices without having to say a word.

My current status.  I am 4 weeks into SL 5x5, all numbers are my reps, I haven't done any 1RM.  SQ @ 225 / OHP @ 115 / DL @ 235 / ROW @ 115 / BP @ 170.

The OHP and the ROW are kicking my butt, and I expect that I will fail those in the next few workouts.  Everything else is hard, but I haven't felt like I have hit my wall yet.  I am eating 150-200g protein a day, 80g coming from supplements.  I sleep ok, 6-7 hours a day, and I can usually get 3 one hour workouts a week in.  My job keeps me on my feet and requires heavy lifting from time to time.

My questions is, not whether a 315 LBS bench is possible, but what kind of mountain am I going to have to climb to get there with my age/fitness level?  Considering the time I have to commit to working out, how long will it take?  I understand that any comments would be very rough estimates, but that is all I am looking for.  Thanks!

Edit:  I would also love any suggestions for getting to 315!
