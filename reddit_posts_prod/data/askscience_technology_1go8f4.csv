How accurate can lie detectors really be and is the technology improving?,Baseyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1go8f4/how_accurate_can_lie_detectors_really_be_and_is/,18,10,"While wasting my life in front of daytime television, i noticed how adamantly they rely on lie detector tests on such shows like jeremy kyle (uk equivalent of jerry springer). They claim the test is almost 99% right. Is this true and if not, can lie detectors ever be perfected? while they appear alot in works of fiction and movies, Surley a lie detector that works could be highly useful in the justice system or in court, simplifying a lot of cases. Im unclear on the details on how existing systems work and as mentioned, only ever really see them on daytime tv or spy dramas. Could someone clarify what the current state of lie detectors is, how effective they are, and how they can be improved?"
