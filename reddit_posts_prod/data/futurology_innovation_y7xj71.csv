Novel innovative patents have been decreasing since the 1970s. I'm worried about what it could mean for our future and decided to dig deeper. (Blog),Raudaschl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/y7xj71/novel_innovative_patents_have_been_decreasing/,8,17,"I thought this community might appreciate this and would help provide feedback.

It recently came to my attention that the number of novel, combinational and original US patents have been decreasing rapidly since the 1970s, and now refinements now make up most patent filings.

Also, around the 1970s, we saw a slowdown in global growth GDP (real GDP), crop yields per acre and a rising infrastructure cost to build the same things we were building decades ago.

I've not seen these topics discussed much and especially not together.

I've summarised my findings in this blog post - [https://uxdesign.cc/innovation-is-slowing-down-5489b282d111](https://uxdesign.cc/innovation-is-slowing-down-5489b282d111)

I would appreciate any thoughts from this community and what this could mean for our future."
