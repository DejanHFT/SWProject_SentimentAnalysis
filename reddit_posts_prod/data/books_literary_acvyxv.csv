"Reading the Bible for literary, non-religious reasons. Anyone else had experience with this?",SolsburyHill710,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/acvyxv/reading_the_bible_for_literary_nonreligious/,95,89,"Hi,
I just started reading the Bible in full for the first time. I'm not a religious person, but I was raised going to (protestant) church every Sunday, went to a Christian school and also have Jewish background and celebrate many of those customs, so it's certainly not a text that's foreign to my life experience. But I wanted to read it because it's perhaps the most influential book ever, and I picked an edition suited to that (Oxford World's Classics, Authorized King James Version with Apocrypha).
I was wondering if anyone else is in/has been in this boat? I'll certainly be taking my time (after about 70 pages of helpful introductory material, I'm up to Genesis 23) and probably won't be finished for about a year, possibly more. But thankfully it's not a book that has to be read all at once. "
