The Ethical Shortcomings of Oregon’s Death with Dignity Act,jstoeltz,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/5hhn3t/the_ethical_shortcomings_of_oregons_death_with/,5,7,"Introduction
     
In 2014, Britney Maynard became the public face in the hotly contested debate over euthanasia, after she announced that she would utilize Oregon’s Death With Dignity Act (DWDA). Maynard suffered from a severe form of cancer, which induced debilitating pain and seizers. After Maynard’s death, many journalists looked to her as an example that Oregon’s DWDA worked to serve those that needed it most. They claimed that euthanasia was a merciful policy that helped suffering patients end their pain. While tragic, Maynard’s case was the exception and not the rule. Maynard cited extreme and debilitating pain as her reason for seeking to use euthanasia, which is actually atypical. The most frequently mentioned end of life concerns of a patient actually are; loss of autonomy, a decreased ability to participate in the activities that make life enjoyable, and the loss of dignity. (Kotva 1.) This shows that pain is typically not the primary motivation when patients seek euthanasia treatment. These three factors then must be shown to be ethically sound justifications for euthanasia. I will examine each of these three concerns and argue that none provide a sound grounding for the practice of euthanasia.


Each of these three criteria where identified in 2014, in Oregon’s yearly DWDA report. I will first examine the loss of autonomy, which 91.4% of euthanasia applicants identified as one of their primary concerns. In this argument, I will examine the position of the utilitarian philosopher Peter Singer, who explains why the right to autonomy ought to be protected. I will contrast his arguments with another ethicist, Daniel Callahan.Callahan’s arguments show that while autonomy is an important right, it is a right with limits.


 After examining autonomy, I will look at the second criteria, of a decreased ability to participate in the activities that make life enjoyable, which was mentioned by 86.7% of DWDA applicants. I will again be examining an argument from Peter Singer for this analysis, in which he describes what he calls, “preference utilitarianism” and explains again why he thinks the preference of a terminally ill patient justifies euthanasia. In retort to this argument, I will show how this argument fails because it does not include a way to qualitatively analyze what constitutes a sound preference.


Lastly, I will examine dignity, which was mentioned by 71.4% of DWDA applicants. For dignities examination, I will review a portion of a case holding by Supreme Court Justice Souter, who believes that dignity constitutes a moral justification for euthanasia. In contrast to Justice Souter’s position, I will use a passage from Epictetus and Greek mythology to illustrate the negative impacts of redefining the end of life as undignified, and show how doing so could have disastrous consequences on members of the handicapped communities.


Through these arguments, I will prove my before mentioned thesis, that loss of autonomy, a decreased ability to participate in the activities that make life enjoyable, nor loss of dignity are acceptable justifications for euthanasia.


Examining Autonomy and the Right to Die


Losing autonomy was cited as patients single greatest concern in the 2014 DWDA report in Oregon. (Kotva 2) With most terminal illness cases involving the elderly, at least some loss of autonomy is to be expected. Of all Oregonians seeking to utilize the DWDA, 91.4% reported this fear as one of their reasons to seek after euthanasia. While utilitarian philosopher, Peter Singer, may argue that autonomy is a central right, which justifies a patient's desire to request euthanasia, I will argue that autonomy has limits, and is not sufficient grounds to justify the practice.


Singer begins his arguments by citing John Stewart Mill, who said, “Individuals are, ultimately, the best judges and guardians of their own interests.” According to Singer’s interpretation of Mill, autonomy grants individuals the ability to make choices in accordance to their own interests, even if those interests may seem counter-intuitive to an impartial spectator. Singer shares a story to illustrate this principal. In this story, you are assigned to guard a bridge and tell people who are about to cross it that it is unsafe, and will collapse under them if they attempt to cross it. If someone decides to cross it however, you are to let them pass. Only they know the importance of why they want to cross, and only they can weigh the risk of crossing the bridge with the importance of getting to the other side. (Singer 606)


Singer claims that the logic of this story helps to justify granting patients requests for euthanasia. He explains, “If beings are capable of making choices, we should allow them to decide whether or not their lives are worth living.” Just as we have the right to life, our autonomy under this logic gives us the right to determine what we do with that life. In the case of a terminally ill patient, Singer concludes that if they decide that their life is no longer worth living, then physicians ought to respect, and aid in expediting the end of their life.


Another moral philosopher, Daniel Callahan argued to the contrary, that autonomy has limits. People ought to have the right to autonomy, but autonomy alone does not grant the individual the right to do what ever they please. In the case of suicide in general, it is difficult, but not impossible to argue that one should not have the right to kill themselves. The case of euthanasia, however, is an entirely different matter. With euthanasia, you have not one, but two moral agents required for a patient to succeed in ending their life. Callahan argues that in this situation, “Euthanasia is no longer a matter of only self-determination, but of a mutual, social decision between two people, the one to be killed, and the other to do the killing.” (Callahan 597)


While a patient’s autonomy may grant them the right to desire to end their life, we must ask where the doctor derives their right to end the life of the patient, or if such a right is even transferable. There is no evidence to suggest that a right such as life is transferable to another. Callahan suggests that the analogous practices of slavery and dueling were ended based on similar reasons; that the right to autonomy and life is non- transferable. Consider if one willing sold themselves into slavery. They would essentially be surrendering all of their autonomy into the hands of another. It is morally wrong for one person to surrender all final freedom into the hands of another, and it is wrong for one to assume total power over another person. With systems such as this in place, one man becomes totally superior over another as the have surrendered the most fundamental characteristic of their humanity, their right to choose. Likewise, in the case of dueling, it is wrong for one to have the power to kill another, even if both parties are consenting and willing to die. (Callahan 597) Such power sets a dangerous precedent in society that life and liberty are commodities that can be exchanged, forfeited, and taken as individuals see fit.
 

A doctor taking the life of a patient is similar to these two examples because a patient surrenders their life and all future autonomy and power to choose into the hands of another. Furthermore, Callahan adds that when physicians take part in administering euthanasia they are not mere merchants administering a service, but moral agents responsible for causing the death of a patient. The doctor, then, must be able to justify why they accepted the transfer of a patient’s right to life and have moral grounds for why their killing was justified. Such claims would be difficult to make solely on the grounds of autonomy.


Singer would likely turn to Mill again for a rebuttal. Mill argued that the limits of autonomy is when one’s actions cause harm to others. Singer may then point out that a doctor is first and foremost a care provider. If a patient had a flu, he would give them a flu shot, if they had broken their arm, he would give them a cast, and in the case of a terminally ill patient who had lost their will to live, he would assist them in suicide. The doctor is not a morally responsible agent in this case, but simply providing a means to a desired end. This end causes no harm to anyone accept the patient that desired it, therefore falling within the bounds of Mill’s ethical limits of autonomy. He may also reiterate the bridge analogy and explain that the doctor is only being complicit in the rational demands of another, hastening death rather than causing it.


In response to these arguments, I utilize a classic thought experiment involving a trolly car. In this situation, we imagine finding ourselves in the operating booth of a rail yard. In front of us is a lever to change the tracks of the incoming trollies. As we examine the rail yard we see an out of control trolly speeding towards three workers. We are then faced with a choice, to pull the lever and save the workers, or allow them to die. While the right thing to do would be to pull the lever and save the workers, we could not say an omission to do so caused their deaths.


In a similar scenario, we again find ourselves in the rail yard, but this time overlooking the yard on top of a bridge. Again we find ourselves witnessing an out of control trolly speeding towards the three workers. With no lever to pull we realize that the only way to save the workers is to push a large man standing beside us in front of the trolly, thus killing the man, but stopping the trolley in its tracks. In this situation, it’s much harder to say whether it’s right to push the man, or let the trolley hit the workers, but it is clear that we would have to assume responsibility for the large man’s death if we chose to push him off the bridge.


In the context of euthanasia, assisting in suicide is not like Singer’s first example, allowing a man to walk across a dangerous bridge. That situation illustrated an omission to protect. In the case of euthanasia, a patient’s right to autonomy does not justify another taking responsibility over their life, and thus becomes the causal factor in their death. (transition)


The Inability to Achieve


After losing autonomy, patients next cited a decreased ability to participate in activities that make life enjoyable, with 86.7% DWDA applicants having this concern. (Kotva 1) Again, Peter Singer describes this qualification for euthanasia through what he calls, preference utilitarianism. There are many approaches to utilitarianism. Hedonistic utilitarianism is perhaps the most common perspective in the utilitarian paradigm. This view defines the ethical as that which brings about the most pleasure, with the least
 amount of pain. Preference utilitarianism, on the other hand, defines morality based upon how close an action gets a person to their ultimate desires. (Singer 606)


It may seem counter-intuitive to use a system of ethics based on achieving one’s desire as a moral grounding for euthanasia, which effectively ends all ability to obtain that which one desires. Singer, however, suggests that it isn’t difficult to see how preference utilitarianism, could, in fact be used to argue for euthanasia. Terminal illness can render a patient completely unable to fulfill any and all of the activities that they found meaningful. Furthermore, when we also factor in the rigors of treatment, a patient's preference may be to simply die. (Singer 607)


 This argument quickly runs into trouble. If we should respect the preference of a terminally ill patient, should we not also respect everyone’s preferences? Should a healthy patient bored of life be granted the same privileges as a terminally ill patient? Should we stand idly by watching a loved one indulge in self-destructive behaviors simply because that is their preference. I would argue no. While Mill may have stipulated that the limits of autonomy end when one causes harm to others, one can cause harm to no one but themselves that is clearly not ethically sound. Drug addictions, even if impacting no one but the user, can wreck havoc on the life of the addict. Likewise, eating in excess can quickly lead to obesity and several other health concerns. Is it right then to allow a drug addict to continue heading down a dangerous path because that is their preference? Is it right to watch a friend ruin their health with unhealthy food and do nothing? No, while the is an element of subjectivity to preference, there are many preferences that are in and of themselves inferior to other desires. Preference utilitarianism is flawed then because it does not factor in guidelines to appraise the quality of a desire.


 Singer’s best argument to address this involves mental states. He contrasts a terminally ill patient with a broken hearted teenager who just ended his first relationship. Both the terminally ill patient and the teenager are contemplating death. While the terminally ill patient knows his state is permanent, the teenager's condition is only temporary and will pass with time. He will still be able to fulfill many more preferences and like most all young heart breaks, his pain will pass in time. Singer concludes that terminally ill patients have a real and rational reason to want death while the teenager's anguish is fleeting, and therefore should strive to go on living. (Singer 607)
The weakness in this argument lies just under its surface. While the teenager very well would be making a horrible mistake if he ended his life, depression is commonly correlated with suicide. In the case of a depressed patient, it is possible for them to want to die. Depression normally impacts a far broader age spectrum then chronic illnesses. Like Singer pointed out, the teenager had allot to live for. This is also true of the depressed patient, that nothing prevents them from achieving better preferences than death. Depression can cloud judgment and impede them from realizing the alternative options that they have available to them.


In the article, Dying in Oregon, Joseph J. Kotva discusses depression and the elderly. (Kotva 3) He argues that little is known about how depression affects elderly, terminally ill patients and that the disease is likely under diagnosed in such patients. It is hard therefore to say that we should abide by the preferences of terminally ill patients when Singer himself says that some judgments can be irrational. Depression is a leading cause of such impaired judgments, and terminally ill patients are surrounded by conditions that can be conducive to depression. Doing more to identify and treat depression in terminally ill patients could help show them, that even in their condition they have better options available to them than an expedited death.


Dignity and Death


Loss of dignity was the final major end of life concern cited in the DWDA report. I will use the case holding of Supreme Court Justice Souter, in the 1997 case Vacco v. Quill, as an example of an authority who supports loss of dignity as an ethical justification for euthanasia. Justice Quill stated, “they seek not only an end to pain (which they might have had, although perhaps at the price of stupor) but an end to their short remaining lives with a dignity that they believe would have been denied them, as well as their conciseness of dependency and helplessness as they approach death.” (Gentzler 1) 


Based upon this description, dignity is a possession that can be lost for various reasons such as falling into a comatose state, feelings of helpless, or shame. Death with dignity then means to allow someone to maintain their dignity until the very end. While it is natural to want to protect dignity, we need to ask, should the end of life be considered undignified.


I will begin analyzing this question by quoting the Roman Stoic philosopher, Epictetus. Epictetus stated “Remember that you are an actor in a drama such as the playwright wishes it to be. If he wants it short, it will be short; if long, long. If he wants you to play a beggar, play even that capably; if a lame man, or a ruler, or a private person. For this is yours, to play your assigned role well. Casting is the business of another” (Epictetus 4)


 This quote applies well to euthanasia. Dying is a natural part of life. In the greek tragedy, Oedipus, the hero is presented with a classic riddle given to him by a giant sphinx. The sphinx asked, “ ""What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, three legs in the evening, and no legs at night?” (Sophocles 1) The answer to the sphinx’s riddle was a man, crawling as a baby, walking on two feet as an adult, and relying on the help of a cane in old age.


Epictetus and the riddle of the sphinx work together to show that man naturally progresses through different stages as he progresses through life. A child has a certain set of limitations. While a child it is a child’s role to act the part of a child. As that child grows into an adult they enjoy more freedom, and their station as an adult grants them greater autonomy and freedom. In old age and illness the freedoms of youth again diminish, but just as a child, or an adult, old age is just a stage in the progression of life. To saw that old age is undignified is to say that being an infant is undignified. The only differences between the sick, old patient, and an infant is that the patient remembers the lost quality of life of their past. This does not change the fact that death and dying are as natural as birth.


Now a critic may say that being aware of a loss of dignity does make the terminally ill patient different from the child. If dignity is what was most dear to a patient, then they should have the right to avoid indignity through having the option to end their life.


 This logic becomes dangerous when we consider what some consider being as being undignified. As mentioned above, many may consider both the idea of being in a comatose state, becoming mentally impaired, or dependency upon another as being undignified. If these conditions are to be commonly accepted as undignified, then the lives handicapped individuals with these ailments suddenly fall into the category of lives that are undignified. If an undignified life justifies the right to end that life, then certain members of the handicapped community will become labeled with worse stigmas then they already deal with. Furthermore, in extreme cases, if dignity becomes our metric for a life worth living, it is possible to imagine a world where some handicapped individuals may be deemed unfit to continue living. Dignity as a justification, then is not an appropriate grounds for euthanasia, because it would both apply that the natural dying process is undignified, and because it would further marginalize and jeopardize the handicapped community.


Conclusion


 Through these arguments, I have shown that all three of these criteria fail as justifications for euthanasia. In my first argument, I explained how it is not just a patient, but a doctor’s autonomy that must be considered in euthanasia. Because a doctor is the causal factor in a euthanasia patients death, they have moral responsibility for that death. In my second position, I explained how preference is extremely difficult to evaluate, and therefore an ineffective moral grounding for euthanasia. Lastly, I iterated that while it is natural to want to protect and preserve dignity, defining death and the conditions surrounding it have consequences that are far too negative to support using dignity as a justification to consider euthanasia. While supports of the DWDA may still consider the bill an effective way to provide mercy for the suffering, I conclude that it fails because the most common justifications for using the bill are not ethically sound.
