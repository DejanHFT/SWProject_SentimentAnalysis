Which future(s) trend is woefully neglected?,CosmicBureaucrat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14zw4pf/which_futures_trend_is_woefully_neglected/,159,71,"Hi everyone! Part of dealing with the future is looking at the probable and prominent trends, say developments in AI, climate change, digitalisation, demographic shifts etc., which also tend to get a fair share of media reporting and professional attention. 

Which trend you'd say is factually quite important, but appears to be somewhat neglected in the overall future(s) and foresight debate?

I, for example, feel like there's a strong focus on digital technologies and innovation, while biological developments (especially at a microbiological level or in mycology) appear to be less reported on."
