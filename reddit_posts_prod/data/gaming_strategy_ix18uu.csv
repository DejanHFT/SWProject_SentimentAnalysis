"Bethesda, economics, and Microsoft strategy",Sphezzle,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ix18uu/bethesda_economics_and_microsoft_strategy/,31,0,"Lots of concern on the internet (and here) that the Bethesda sale means Elder Scrolls, Doom, and many other Bethesda IP are likely to be Xbox exclusive going forwards. I wanted to take a second to unpick this, because not only do I doubt this is the case - I actually think it tells us a lot about Microsoft's approach to exclusivity (i.e. not doing it) altogether.

First, Bethesda is entirely reliant on PlayStation sales to exist as an entity. However many games they've sold on MS platforms over the last decade, they've sold abundantly more on Sony. Their financial plans as an organisation, and the livelihood of most of their staff, is entirely reliant on the PlayStation revenue stream. To work as a prudent investment for Microsoft, it either needs to lay off 75% of the workforce, or it needs to sell Bethesda games to PlayStation.

I've read some speculation that Bethesda will be dissolved and merged with Microsoft studios. I find this unlikely, but I also think it doesn't really solve the problem above in substance, it just means the the problem has a different face on it.

What's more interesting to me is that it indicates more than ever how much Microsoft don't believe in exclusivity. Knowing everything I just said, Ms still chose to drop $7.5 billion on this acquisition. They are not in this game for exclusives. To those of you weighing up whether to buy an XBox this year - I caution you to think about that, and not the far less likely scenario that Elder Scrolls VI doesn't get a (potentially slightly delayed - I see this as a pretty superficial problem in the long run but I know it narks some of you) PS5 release.

Edit: I take the point some of you have made that PS isn't keeping Bethesda afloat. I was imprecise with my language here. Though I stand by my argument that PlayStation are a key partner in keeping Bethesda working at its current scale, I totally accept that Bethesda could operate in a much scaled down state without them."
