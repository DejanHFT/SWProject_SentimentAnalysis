Any good first hand WW2 experiance stories?,fate_of_etims,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/68lktj/any_good_first_hand_ww2_experiance_stories/,366,597,"I just finished reading A man's search for meaning by Viktor Frankl and it is an exceptional book that truly gives a deep perspective of life in Auschwitz and how he as a prisoner learnt to survive. Are their any other first hand experience stories that give the same chilling read whilst being extremely insightful and teach valuable life lessons, thanks!"
