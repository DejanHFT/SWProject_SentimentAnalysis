Please help an ignorant girl achieve her weight loss goals!,cheese_n_mackers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4krqfu/please_help_an_ignorant_girl_achieve_her_weight/,34,4,"Hi. I am 16 years old. I have been bullied about my weight and I am very insecure. I'm tired of telling myself ""I'll do better"", and ""I'll get there eventually"". I have severe asthma so excercise can be pretty difficult. Running is the worst, but I can't jog on a treadmill okay. The photos attached are what I want to look like VS. what I look like now. My mom is strictly against any dietary supplements other than protein. Please tell me what I can eat and what excercise I can do to at least get close to body goals. I feel unattractive and I've never had a boyfriend or been kissed and I just want to raise my self esteem and feel beautiful. I am 5'1"" and between 130-140 lbs currently. Thank you for those who comment. If I get some good responses I will update my progress with photos and logs of how I'm working towards better in myself. PLEASE! I want to lose weight, but I don't know what excercise a to do or what to eat! [pics ](https://m.imgur.com/account/mackennagirl/images)"
