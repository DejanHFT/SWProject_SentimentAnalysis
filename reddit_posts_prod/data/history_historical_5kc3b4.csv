Myths that turned out to have surprising historical credibility? (I.e. Odin coming from the Caucasus),Das_Hog_Machine,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5kc3b4/myths_that_turned_out_to_have_surprising/,170,402,"It surprised me when I heard that the ""mythological"" Odin moved to Scandinavia with his people from a place called Aser in the Caucasus. Amazing considering we know via archeology and genetics that the Caucasus is the origin of Norse people.

What other myths have turned out to have more credibility than we thought?"
