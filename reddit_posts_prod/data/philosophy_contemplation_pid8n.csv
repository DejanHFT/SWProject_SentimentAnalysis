"Since elephants mourn the dead, do you think they think about their own deaths and or an afterlife?",KnotSeaParty,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/pid8n/since_elephants_mourn_the_dead_do_you_think_they/,92,146,"I think that if elephants understand that a fellow elephant is dead and gone (and studies have shown it strongly appears that they do in fact mourn the dead) it's likely they will be aware of their own death and experience existential anxiety as humans do. Obviously we won't really ever know what they are thinking, but do you guys think they contemplate their own deaths, or am I assigning elephants too much cognitive power?"
