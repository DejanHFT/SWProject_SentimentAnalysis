Long-Term Motivation Tips,GorillaJ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/pjpg6/longterm_motivation_tips/,200,0,"So, for about a year and a half now, maybe two years, I've been at the same weight (~280 lbs).  I used to be 330, I dropped to 280, and then... it stopped dropping.  And it's not dropped at all since, maybe I even got a little fatter again, I'm not entirely sure.  I'm not healthier, my stamina's no better, I'm not meaningfully stronger.  The only thing I've lost since then is the good feelings from going below 300 and the motivation from results I saw to continue on.

It's hellish.  I'm constantly starving, I move more than I ever used to.  I can't go to a gym, as I'm jobless and broke, but I move more than before, inside and out.  I don't eat nearly as much as my body wants to.  I even cut out soda, but it didn't lead to any change I could see over the course of a few months so I have one now and again (I've had less than 10 since the start of 2012, so I'm not secretly guzzling calories).

How do you guys, who stall and stop seeing progress, manage continued motivation?  I'm about to throw my hands up in the air and just gorge myself 24/7 again, because if I'm going to be fat anyway I may as well be doing it with a content stomach."
