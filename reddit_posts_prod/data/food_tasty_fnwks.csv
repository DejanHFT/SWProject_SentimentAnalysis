"Puttanesca, perhaps the ultimate food for students wanting a nutritious, tasty, easy and cheap dinner. ",Seachicken,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/fnwks/puttanesca_perhaps_the_ultimate_food_for_students/,124,130,"Having recently graduated from university, Pasta Puttanesca (Whore's Pasta) is one of the meals that stood out for me as a superb escape from bland food. If you make it reasonably regularly, the ingredients mostly carry over to subsequent meals, (except for the basil) and most of them are relatively cheap anyway. 

The pasta is made many different ways, but here's what I like to do.

Chop a small onion (be careful not to add too much onion, and if you don't want it it could be omitted) and a few cloves of garlic up, saute on a medium heat, and then add in chopped chilli and some anchovies (I like 2-3 fillets, depending on size). Stir in a 400g tin of diced tomatoes (try and avoid the super cheap tins and get something reasonable for a few cents more if you can), some capers, (I can only get them in vinegar, so I wash them) some kalamata olives (washed). Simmer, add pepper and salt, then right before it's cooked mix in some chopped basil leaves. 
I like it with Rigatoni though some people swear only long pasta will do.
