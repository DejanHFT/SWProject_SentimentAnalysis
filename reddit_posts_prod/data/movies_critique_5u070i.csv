Why does this sub hate Avatar for a generic storyline whilst praising Marvel and Star Wars films for the same.,gokkku,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5u070i/why_does_this_sub_hate_avatar_for_a_generic/,2131,6273,"It's been confusing me to say the least. I just watched Avatar for the first time yesterday, although I could see where it was going, I thought it was well executed.

Yes I get the arguments; ""it's Pocahontas"" in space. So what? Does it  make the film worse; no.

I've seen a thread in r/starwars get upvoted for basically stating that the Obi Wan film should be like Seven Samurai. And if they do that, I can gurantee it will be highly praised by this sub.

Every Marvel film has basically the same hero's journey, and you can see everything that happens from a mile away. The only film that seemed to deviate from this was Civil War and that's it.

So what gives? Why does Avatar get the hate while others get the praise."
