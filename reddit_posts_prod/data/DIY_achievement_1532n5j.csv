Painting on guitar,Zadjali_Snake,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1532n5j,1,0,"Hi guys, I’m planning on working on a project where I try to replicate Chris Martin’s guitar. But I’m unsure on how to paint the colored rainbow with?? Acrylics or watercolor?? Any help on this please is appreciated. 

Till now, what I’m having in mind is that I will spray paint the front of the guitar white then spray it again either ash brown or gray then I start to sandpaper it to achieve the same texture. Do think this will work?"
