Working out when you know you are not sleeping well tonight.,Ride-My-Pony,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ab5jsa/working_out_when_you_know_you_are_not_sleeping/,22,22,"I'm not sure if working out is beneficial for me today. Because I'll probably go to bed at 6 in the morning because of new years, also planning on making an exception and drinking some beers tonight.

Is it worth it to work out today? Or will it just set me back because I will not ""heal"" enough?
