Is Piano The Only Instrument With Constant Melody?,deathbypepe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/sqk1xq/is_piano_the_only_instrument_with_constant_melody/,5,0,"*Please understand that i dont know if the title makes sense, let me elaborate.*

The Saxophone is often criticized for the habitual resorting to playing Instrumentals, often characterized by having the same notes repeatedly loop.

Admittedly these melodies do sound objectively good and tasteful, but they are a severe disservice to what a Saxophone can do as Jazz enthusiasts would concur.

**Examples would be popular songs like;**

**- George Michael - Careless Whisper**

**- Gerry Rafferty - Baker Street**

However to my memory the Piano can have entire pieces without filler, moving from 1 melody to another melody and so on.

Never having the possibility of resorting to recycling the same 14 or so notes throughout the course of a song.
