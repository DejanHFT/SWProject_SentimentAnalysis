"I made beef bourguignon into a paste, and its delicious.",Meri_Stormhood,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/15udp3f/i_made_beef_bourguignon_into_a_paste_and_its/,0,0,"I just ground up every ingredient you can grind up, threw it into a pressure pot, with the meat going in whole some time after, it sat on the stove for 3 hours and I made it into a fine paste when it got all brown and maillardy (including the meat).
Mainly done it cause I didnt wanna deal with it much, and because I had a chunk of bone laying in the freezer which wouldnt have been fun to break up otherwise on the plate. I separated the solid fats of course.

Put this on a toast and its a wonderful snack.

Oh and p.s I put the bone in the pressure cook when it's done for another 30m to get anything left in it flowing into the water it was cooked in, reduced it and it was then I realized why people love bone marrow."
