"Lost FFM as well as body fat, but also gained inches?",KaelaMB1996,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/b44jo8/lost_ffm_as_well_as_body_fat_but_also_gained/,15,2,"Hi Everyone. Some quick considerations is that I'm Black, Female, and 5'8.

I've recently came from my monthly body composition test (a BIA), and **the reading said I have 43.6 lbs of fat mass, and 115 lbs of Fat-Free-Mass and am overall 159.2 lbs.** The last time I did a checkup (a month ago in February) **I was 46.2 lbs of fat, 117.0 lbs of fat free mass, and overall 163.2 lbs.** I also had my inches checked, and I have gained a inch on my arms, calves and thighs. The only explanation given to me was that I was gaining muscle in those areas.

Any reason this could be? **How am I losing fat-free mass but also gaining muscle inches?** Was the impedance off? Desirably I'm trying to re-comp; lose fat and put on muscle mass. I've been lifting heavy, doing full-body weight training every other day 3x a week, HIIT cardio twice a week, and intermittent fasting, however in my eating window I generally eat until I'm full, and don't really watch calories. My strength has also increased, and I can lift heavier and do way more than I could do in January. Maybe the exam was off?"
