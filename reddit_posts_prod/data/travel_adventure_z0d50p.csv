I am looking at going to Thailand but as a female solo traveler who hasn't done any further than Europe (I'm from the UK) I would like to be apart of a group and do a tour round Thailand with a travel company. --- [https://www.gadventures.com/trips/bangkok-to-hanoi/8841/itinerary/#day-9](https://www.gadventures.com/trips/bangkok-to-hanoi/8841/itinerary/#day-9)   


I've found G-Adventures and it sounds pretty decent although I don't know if this particular trip is worth it for the money. I dont know if i am missing any key info that can tell me if its not worth doing. Other than that I'll probably pick this one unless you have any thoughts. 

Before anyone says why don't you read it - (I have but i struggle with processing things and missing bits of information and have got myself into issues in the past from not reading and understanding things properly. Thank you)"
