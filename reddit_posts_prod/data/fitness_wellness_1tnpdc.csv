"My 1 year transformation: ~300 pounds to 185. Even though I'm well past it, I feel like I'm 40 again. (pics inside)",tsarizard,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1tnpdc/my_1_year_transformation_300_pounds_to_185_even/,20,310,"**Background**: I'm getting up there in years, and for as long as I can remember I've been overweight (at least 300 pounds). During the Holidays last year, I caught a glance of myself in the mirror and realized something needed to change. So, I made a new years resolution to get my life together; fix my diet, start exercising, and just start living a more healthful life. These days I only work seasonally, so it was easy to make find time to get myself in shape. I wouldn't have been able to do it without the support of the Mrs and the little ones, they really kept me in check, as did this subreddit. I worked hard to better myself, and I think the results really speak for themselves

**Diet**: My first step was to change my diet, which was hard because I'm prone to binge eating. I cut out all sweets, dairy, and red meats like Venison (which was honestly the majority of my diet) and replaced them with lean meats, Fish, and green vegetables. The fat started to melt away almost immediately and seeing such good results kept me going. I didn't really count calories, I just ate healthy foods like Eggs, Oatmeal, Vegetables, Nuts, Chicken, Fish, etc. and I *stopped eating* when I was full. I ate sparingly until a few weeks ago when I started bulking to put on mass. Now I just eat as much as possible; I still try to avoid ""junk food"" but with it being the holidays, it's difficult to resist temptation

**Exercise**: When I was first starting out I just focused on integrating exercise into my daily routine. I started with walking, then jogging, and then (at the suggestion of the Mrs) ""polercising"". In conjunction with good eating I quickly got real solid results. Around July I realized I should start lifting, but I didn't know where to start. Thankfully, I got everything I needed from the FAQ of this subreddit. I live in a pretty isolated area without access to a real gym, so I had to improvise. For my routine I followed the standard 5x5 SS, focusing on the major compound lifts a few times a week. At first, I could barely bench one elf, but I persevered and by September my lifts had all at least doubled. By then my running had progressed to the point where I could keep up with the Caribou native to the area, and in November I was* finally* able to squat Rudolph, the lightest of the herd and just shy of 300 pounds. My goal is to be able to deadlift Prancer by February. Right now my lifts are:

* OHP: 1 regulation Christmas tree
* Bench: 5 Elves
* Squat: Blitzen 
* Deadlift: Mrs Clause (I know it's a little high compared to my other weights)
