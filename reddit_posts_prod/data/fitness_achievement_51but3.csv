Tired of lifting weights. I'd like to have more control of my body over having strong muscles. How do I achieve this?,Chinesezorro,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/51but3/tired_of_lifting_weights_id_like_to_have_more/,48,25,"Title says it all. I've been lifting weights for years now and I've done pretty well. I'm up 45 pounds but I'm tired of doing it. I'd rather have more control over my body. I see people in the gym perfectly balancing while doing a one handed hand stand and I'd rather have that kind of control over being able to bench and deadlift a lot of weight but I have no idea how to do it. Cross fit? Yoga? Kick boxing? Rock climbing? What's best? 

Thanks in advance reddit! "
