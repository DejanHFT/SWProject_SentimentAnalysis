Am I over spending?,badtradesguynumber2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/19aa300/am_i_over_spending/,16,0,"Hey all,

My DIY project for my renovations is currently costing at $7000. My ideal budget is $10,000 all said in done.

House: 1000 sqft, 3 bedroom, 2 washroom.

Initial: I have no tools whatsoever and had to buy everything. I also had some plumber do some work ($1000 all in).

Renovation task list:

\- replace 2 vanities

\- replace 2 toilets

\- replace 1000 sqft of flooring (currently costed $3055)

\- replace baseboard for entire house

\- paint

\- drywall repair

\- backsplash for kitchen. requires replacing drywall for the wall (approximately

\- new cabinets (wall kitchen approximately 12ft long)

\- new kitchen sink.

\- new quartz countertop

&#x200B;

Projection: currently I'm anticipating that I will be over budget at a total of approximately $13,500.

Is this a reasonable amount ? was the $10k Unreasonable to begin with?
