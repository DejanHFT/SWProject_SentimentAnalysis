"Post your L4D2 strategies, hints and tips!",Kasyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/an2mc/post_your_l4d2_strategies_hints_and_tips/,162,35,"I'm relatively new at the game, and have been playing online quite a bit. In this short timespan, I have learned one or two basic tricks that may not seem obvious at first. Perhaps, with the help of the /r/gaming community, we can turn this into a helpful resource for new and experienced L4D2 players alike.

Some tips:

* When you're about to leave the safe room - if there are an excess of Healing Packs that are just going to waste - heal yourself twice and grab a third(unless your particular server's netiquette frowns upon this sort of thing), it's not as if you're coming back for them (obviously not applicable to Hard Rain).

* When playing as the Boomer, make sure you spawn at the last possible second. You are extremely easy to kill, so make sure you ambush the survivors or puke on them before they see you. You can also be a Boomer Bomb - jumping from a high place and landing on the survivors, exploding and covering them in puke. It is really only worth while puking on survivors when there are a lot of infected around (either during an incoming attack, or during car alarms, etc.)

* As the Smoker, try to pull the survivors into the Witch. Make sure you put the Witch between yourself and the survivors - this might cause one of the survivors with an itchy trigger finger to shoot at you, thus startling the witch.

* (This is UNCONFIRMED) When playing against the AI, if you see a Jockey heading towards you, try crouching - from my experience it appears that the AI Jockey does not jump on your face whilst you are crouching (please tell me if this is incorrect).

* As the Spitter, if your spit is recharging and there is a incap'd player, go stand on top of them - if they or their teammates kill you, you're still going to leave them lying in a pile of burning shit.

* During the Hotel section of the first campaign (as well as the Bridge finale on the last), the Charger can be used to knock the survivors out of the windows or off the ledge, allowing for an insta-kill.

* When playing as the infected, there are certain parts of some maps where the survivors are unable to go back once they have crossed a certain point. Use this to your advantage - if one survivor lingers behind, be sure to pull him back (use the Jockey or Smoker to get him as far out of range of the other survivors as possible), this way the other survivors will not be able to assist him.

* As the Hunter, try going for a straggling survivor instead of a leader - it is more of a bitch for the survivors to go back, instead of carrying on forwards, and gives your teammates, as well as the horde, more time to inflict damage on the survivors as they spend more time between safehouses.

* When riding a survivor's face as the Jockey, try and keep out of range of the other survivors (either by going under a staircase, or around a corner, etc.) - the longer you can refrain from getting shot off, the more damage you will do. Jockeys are also useful for leading a survivor into Spitter goo, or fire, or into an alarmed car. Also remember that falling damage is great - try get the survivors to fall off the roofs of buildings. You cannot (as far as I am aware) get an insta-kill as the Jockey - if you pull a survivor off a ledge that would cause them to fall to their death, they will be able to grab on and hang out until another survivor can come to their aid. This is, however, a useful way to incapacitate stragglers. 

I hope some of these tips come in handy - you may already be aware of all of them, and you may think some of them are just silly or painfully obvious. 

EDIT: thought of a few more..."
