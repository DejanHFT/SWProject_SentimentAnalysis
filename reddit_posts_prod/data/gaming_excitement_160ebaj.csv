Is ANYONE out there excited for Dragon Age 4?,VioletJones6,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/160ebaj/is_anyone_out_there_excited_for_dragon_age_4/,131,16,"First of all, I'm a huge Dragon Age fan. And by huge I mean that I genuinely loved DA2 for what it was (hundreds of hours, have seen everything it has to offer), and also beat Inquisition 4-5 times. Origins speaks for itself.


But with that said... I can't think of anything positive regarding the release of DA4. Ignoring the fact that BioWare is a shell of its former self, has any press release coming from that studio inspired confidence that this game will be anything other than terrible? They won't have the budget of a true AAA, none of the people responsible for creating the lore and characters we love work there anymore, and at a time when BG3 has come out and shown that a true sequel in the vein of DA:O is economically viable... They lay off more staff and try to convince us that this is going to result in a better game.

Despite having zero expectations, I feel as though this is going to be the most disappointing release ever. 

So I'm asking you all, am I just being cynical or does everything about this game point towards it being complete garbage?

Edit: Just realized I called it DA4... I have no idea where that came from, though I guess that reveals how little I truly care at this point."
