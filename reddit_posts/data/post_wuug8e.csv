"TIL that Christopher Columbus' smaller two ships were not really named the Niña and the Pinta. The Niña was actually named the Santa Clara, but was nicknamed after its owner, Juan Niño of Moguer. The original name of The Pinta is lost, and is only known by its nickname (the painted one).",derstherower,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyages_of_Christopher_Columbus#First_voyage,804,21285,No text content
