Ideas for multi-day (guided?) adventure trips,slow__tomato,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/169pisj/ideas_for_multiday_guided_adventure_trips/,5,7,"I’m trying to generate ideas for trips that are multi-day adventure travel (possibly all inclusive and/or guided). My partner and I are both outdoorsy, we both ski (alpine + touring), both bike (road + mountain), are always down for hiking and love trying new things. These don’t have to be extremely adrenaline-heavy trips, just mostly outdoors (and we have different appetites for bougie-ness so are open to the whole range). Some examples of the kinds of trips I’m talking about that one or both of us has done in the past that fit this criteria:

- Sailing charter in the BVIs
- Salkantay Trek to Machu Picchu
- Sail/ski trip in the Lyngen Alps 

We’re less interested in city travel, and a la carte travel where we pick our own home base in an adventurous place and figure out things to do day by day — this stresses me out. 

The ideas I have so far along these lines are:

- Safari 
- Ski the Haute Route 
- Patagonia/W trek 

Would love some help with ideas!"
