"Hey AskScience, what's your reaction to Roger Penrose's ""The Emperor's New Mind""?",nonreligious,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/d7o9w/hey_askscience_whats_your_reaction_to_roger/,8,3,"I've finished reading it, and it was pretty tough going at times, despite my familiarity with most of the physics involved.

I know that people who believe in ""strong AI"" and think the ""singularity"" will occur around 2030 have strong misgivings about the idea that consciousness cannot arise out of a sufficiently complicated algorithm. 

I'm inclined to agree with Penrose, but as the book is 20+ years old now, some of his stuff is probably outdated. Your thoughts?
