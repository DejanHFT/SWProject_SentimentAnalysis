Any Good Creative competitions?,our_louise,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/it74z9/any_good_creative_competitions/,1,2,"I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations on good creative competitions or weekly/monthly tasks? To flex creative muscles.   
It could be photography, illustration, lettering, design etc, anything where people answer set tasks."
