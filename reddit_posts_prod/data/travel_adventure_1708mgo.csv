Horseback riding adventure tours,pizzaerryday,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1708mgo/horseback_riding_adventure_tours/,2,1,I’m looking for horseback riding tours for experienced riders in interesting locales. Does anyone have experience taking one or researching them? So far I’ve really only been able to find some in North America and Black-Saddle.com adventure tours. I’ve seen the Mongolian ones as well. I’m more interested in Latin America and Europe. Maybe Asia or Australia. Ideally somewhere I could go in the winter. Pretty desperate for something like this in the near future.
