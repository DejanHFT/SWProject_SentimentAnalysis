"Anyone feel, reviews-wise, a longing for Roger Ebert?",--TheForce--,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/11wxfh1/anyone_feel_reviewswise_a_longing_for_roger_ebert/,280,654,"After I watch an older movie that I've never seen, I immediately look to see if Roger Ebert reviewed it, and if he did, I read his review. 

But every once in a while, when I do this, I find out the movie I just watched came out after he passed, and I get disappointed/sad. 

Does that ever happen to anyone else?

And I haven't found another go-to critic. So with new movies, I kind of just read whatever I find."
