**Sample Reviews:**

The new ""Scream"" may be the first horror movie that turns the mockery of fan service into its own fan service. Is it fun? Mostly, yes. - Owen Gleiberman, *Variety*

Seriously over-indulges in self-referential cleverness, to the point of undermining the actual scare factor. - David Rooney, *The Hollywood Reporter*

A horror movie, through and through. It's also a small-town drama. It's also a vicious and spot-on commentary about some of the more repugnant fads in the modern entertainment hellscape. It's also extremely funny. - William Bibbiani, *TheWrap*

Even afresh batchof newcomers can't keep the staleness from creeping in, although the new ""Scream"" nicely mines modern movie discourse in a way to justify its own existence. **2.5/4** \- Brian Truitt, *USA Today*

The new ""Scream"" stabs and jabs at our memories of the original and creates some bloody fresh twists of its own. **3.5/4** \- Richard Roeper, *Chicago Sun-Times*

The new creative team effectively taps into a quarter century of real-world affinity from fans for some clever meta commentary within the film. **3/4** \- Zaki Hasan, *San Francisco Chronicle*

It stumbles by the end - these movies always do - but by bringing itself full circle, it stands as the best ""Scream"" since the original. **B-** \- Adam Graham, *Detroit News*

It does little but reference the previous films (this is the fifth in the franchise), but it does so in smart, fun ways. **3.5/5** \- Bill Goodykoontz, *Arizona Republic*

Over two hours, Cinco de Scream-o lumbers along with routine kills and few surprises even when it makes lame attempts at shocking us. **2/4** \- Johnny Oleksinski, *New York Post*

I have to admit that there is some watchable gonzo humour to this fivequel (though I hid under my seat for the violent bits.) **3/5** \- Peter Bradshaw, *Guardian*

The whole cast are game, bringing the same fresh-faced, cool kid energy that's been the common denominator of every past Scream star... And the film finds plenty of ways to deliver fresh and funny scares. **4/5** \- Clarisse Loughrey, *Independent (UK)*

It gets almost too meta to function. **2/4** \- Tim Robey, *Daily Telegraph (UK)*

It's impossible not to appreciate the ""guess the killer"" game that remains the franchise's central (and now only?) draw. But it's crushingly over-familiar and sadly fright free. **2/5** \- Kevin Maher, *Times (UK)*

It's very much your father's Scream. You're not going to be scared by it, but you may like being swaddled in something as cozily familiar as Freddy Krueger's sweater. **B-** \- Joshua Rothkopf, *Entertainment Weekly*

It's neither fan service nor anti-fan service, just as it's not quite a sequel and not quite a reboot. Whatever it is, it's not much of a movie. - Richard Lawson, *Vanity Fair*

When you go to the same funhouse five times, you begin to see the cracks in the hall of mirrors. **2.5/4** \- Mara Reinstein, *Us Weekly*

For the most part, this is a 're-quel' as fast, funny and ferocious as a Scream movie should be. In an era of elevated horror, it's a gloriously gory basement party. **4/5** \- Ben Travis, *Empire Magazine*

This clever, heavily meta picture has fun both mocking its own existence and trying to find enough twists to justify itself. But the film is ultimately undone by the contortions necessary to keep the irreverent sleight-of-hand going. - Tim Grierson, *Screen International*

This latest spree is openly modelled - set-piece by set-piece - on the first Scream, even as it constantly negotiates its own delicate status as a 'requel' in a shifting horror landscape. - Anton Bitel, *Little White Lies*

It's impossible to forget you're watching a fictional film. It may be exciting to let the audience in on the joke, but it's hard to get lost in this world. **B-** \- Jude Dry, *indieWire*

A slick, self-satisfied giggle of a movie. **B-** \- Katie Rife, *AV Club*

Scream takes a hard, thoughtful look at Craven's legacy and the genre, carving up brutal commentary while holding up a bloodied mirror. **4/5** \- Meagan Navarro, *Bloody Disgusting*

The new movie successfully continues the Scream tradition of evolving via sharp, fresh commentary on the horror genre, but one of the fifth installment's most striking qualities is that it is absolutely oozing with love and respect for this franchise. **4.5/5** \- Perri Nemiroff, *Perri Nemiroff (YouTube)*

**Plot**

Twenty-five years after a streak of brutal murders shocked the quiet town of Woodsboro, a new killer has donned the Ghostface mask and begins targeting a group of teenagers to resurrect secrets from the townâ€™s deadly past.
