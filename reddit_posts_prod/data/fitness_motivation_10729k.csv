Motivation down after 2 years,sabe7881,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/10729k/motivation_down_after_2_years/,24,11,"I've been working out for 2 and a half years now with 2 years of eat well, male 22. At one point I was working out using caffeine to help, but have been off of it for a good month. I am now having problems staying motivated at the gym. I catch my self drifting off and cutting my work outs short. Sorry if spelling may be off, using phone. Can any one give me tips, what motivates you."
