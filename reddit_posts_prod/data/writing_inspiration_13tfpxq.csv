Advice for inspiration and “where the line goes”,mrcheeseswe,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/13tfpxq/advice_for_inspiration_and_where_the_line_goes/,3,2,"Hey, I have a really great idea for a book/story but it’s heavily inspired by a character from a tv-show I’m watching. Like they have the same power and personality etc. Should I try to figure out another story or go with it? Where does the line for inspiration and straight up copying go?
(Sorry for grammar mistakes English isn’t my first language)"
