"Me [24F] with the support staff in my office [20sF], they talk about me in Spanish",Hdjfisbscdigktbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/703g2i/me_24f_with_the_support_staff_in_my_office_20sf/,136,819,"Please forgive any grammatical mistakes and my inability to write in a way that sounds nice. I'm running on very little sleep right now and I don't have the energy to make myself sound smart. 

I'm an intern at a law firm. I started working at the firm a couple months ago and I'll continue to work there throughout this school year and maybe during the summer if it's a good fit. I'm a full time student in my second year of law school so I'm only working 20 or so hours per week. 

All of the lawyers in the office are really nice. The support staff is nice to my face but talk shit about me in Spanish. During my first week of work, they asked me what my ethnicity is (I'm darker than your average white person and have dark hair) and if I spoke Spanish. I said that I didn't speak Spanish because it's true. I probably should have told them that I understand it pretty well, having grown up around Spanish speakers. 

Since the first week, I've heard them talk about me almost every day. If I ask the attorneys a question, they'll mock me or complain that they have to hear my voice. They make fun of the way I dress, even though it's standard business casual (the norm in the office). I know I shouldn't care what they think of me but it's making it unpleasant to work here.

I honestly have no idea what I did to make them dislike me. I've always treated them with respect. I'm friendly. I don't make unnecessary noise. I really don't get it. 

I've thought about saying something to the attorneys but I'm worried it will hurt my chances of having an opportunity to work here this summer. I'm just an intern so I'm replaceable. The newest member of the support staff has been here for almost two years. None of the attorneys speak Spanish so I don't think they know that this is happening. 

Is there a way to fix this? Should I suck it up or start looking for a new job?

  **tl;dr**: the support staff in my office talk shit about me in Spanish, thinking I don't understand them. I'm a lowly intern so I don't want to make waves. What do, Reddit?"
