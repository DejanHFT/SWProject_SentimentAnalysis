inspiration?,guiltygrande,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/kv8bl8/inspiration/,11,8,I LOVE writing stories but I basically have no inspiration. Most of my story ideas are somewhat based off of movies or video-game plots that are just mixed together. Does anyone have any good tips to get inspired or where you get your inspiration from?
