Literary anti-intellectualism on reddit,macnalley,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1nvafi/literary_antiintellectualism_on_reddit/,503,523,"Over the last few days a link to the New York Times blog featuring a study regarding literary fiction's ability to teach empathy has been circulating several subreddits, and with it I've noticed a very interesting phenomenon. I've seen it here, on Science, on Writing, and perhaps some other places I don't remember, and the popular response has been largely the same in each place. It seems the reddit has a very intense hate for ""intellectual"" literature.

This really surprised me, because for the most part people on reddit are pretty much universally pretentious assholes when it comes to intellectual superiority. The whole atheism/STEM/liberal politics circlejerk thing is funny to us because it's so massively prevalent on this site to the point we can anticipate it within seconds of a thread being born. Yet, the moment literary fiction or symbolic literature is brought up there is an instantaneous and vitriolic backlash. People say, ""Anything written down is literary,"" ""Symbolism is just invented by pretentious English professors in their ivory towers,"" ""The door is just a goddamn door,"" ""Genre fiction has merit too, just look at x, y, and z.""

This isn't a new phenomenon, and isn't exclusive to literary subreddits. I've seen it in nearly every art post on reddit, but right now I'm going to focus on literature because that's what I know most about. I've seen this on book- and writing-related subreddits since I got here, and I'll admit, I was a little disappointed when I discovered 90% of the writers here do fantasy, sci-fi, or erotica, and 90% of book posts are about the latest popular series. However, the fact that redditors are so willing to beat down so-perceived ""pretentious"" works of literature really disturbs me.

The division between genre fiction and literary fiction is one that is fairly universally accepted by critics and writers. It's a blurry line, but one that almost anyone will agree exists. Genre fiction adheres to the tropes of its given genre for the express intent of attracting readers, keeping them entertained, and selling books. Literary fiction can make use genre tropes, but not for the purpose of fitting into a given genre, rather it uses them as a device to further whatever is' the intent of the work. Yes, symbolism exists and isn't just ""made-up"" by professors. Most non-genre writers have a reason for writing books and telling stories beyond keeping you entertained; like any artist, they have something to express about the world they feel strongly about. For a good writer, this means that every single word is chosen deliberately as a means of expressing that. Why did the writer choose to have a door? Why is it brown? Symbolism isn't always love, and death, and metaphysics; sometimes it's merely evocative, and the door is brown because doors are imposing, and brown is dreary. But there is a reason. And no, genre fiction does not meet the standards of literary fiction. Genre fiction can be well-written, engrossing, feature interesting characters, and be a monumental work of time and effort, but in the end it exists only to conform to what has come before for the sake of the readership. It's not trying to do anything artistically, and when it does, it then becomes a matter of arguing whether it does so well, using its devices effectively, which more often than not it isn't because it's so concerned with adhering to its formula.

That's just my piece, something I've been meaning to say for a while but only recently been prompted to. Feel free to debate and/or hate mail and/or thank me.
**TL;DR Reddit be hatin' because there are things that exist outside the scope of its intellectual comfort zone, and it's afraid it's not the most intelligent being in the universe.**

EDIT: A lot of people seem to think I'm making the argument that all tropes are bad, or that anything in a genre is bad. That's not what I'm saying. Tropes are everywhere, and if you don't use them you end up with *Finnegan's Wake*. Similarly every piece of work falls into a genre, and that's essentially unavoidable. The divide I was making was this: Pieces that write themselves into a genre for the sake of being in that genre are ""genre fiction,"" they're entertaining but intellectually unambitious. Piece that use tropes well to advance some idea are ""literary,"" that is deserving of literary merit. Also, there are plenty of works that get written into the ""literary fiction"" genre that are really nothing more than another form of genre fiction because they either bring no new ideas or advance their ideas poorly.

DOUBLE EDIT: I'm really just a writer who is upset because reddit thinks my genre is pretentious. These kinds of arguments are what help me sleep at night and cry less when the rejection letters come in the mail. But I still think I'm smarter than all you petty genre writers, and I hope you never find my secret folder about robots and and time travel or my collection of WoT books.

EDIT THE THIRD: What if for the sake of discussion and stirring things up, I introduced a comparison to another art form that reddit knows fairly intimately: videogames? Videogames have genres. One genre reddit likes to hate on is the first-person shooter for its endless cookie-cutter remakes (CoD) featuring the same dull, uninspired gameplay. There are good shooters. Battlefield is a wonderful shooter that's done a lot to advance the shooter genre. It is a piece that has merit within the form of the videogame. But would you argue it has the same level of artistic merit as something like Papers Please, which uses nearly every aspect of its gameplay as a device to drive home points about moral decisions and the human condition?

EDIT THE FINAL: I wanted to thank reddit for enlightening me that I am a pretentious douchebag for believing that some works of art have more artistic value than others and that reddit is fundamentally opposed to this idea. The lines I drew may have been badly drawn, and I'd need to to a lot of thinking to correct them, but I will maintain that they exist and not all fiction is created equal. I'd also like to thank reddit for somewhat proving my point by having several of the highest comments simply calling me a twat, an  asshole, or a douchebag with no attempt at discussion. In seriousness though, I'd like to thank everyone who took the time to write out well-reasoned responses on both sides: you've caused me to think a little bit more and a little bit deeper about writing and art, which is all I've ever really wanted to do. I'd also be happy to talk personally with any one of you about any literary topic if you send me a personal message."
