What to Charge as a Creative Director?,craycraykiwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/p741bn/what_to_charge_as_a_creative_director/,2,0,"Hi, I've been approached to be the creative director of the launch of a music artist's EP. I'll lead and oversee the creative development of a music video, album art, and promotional photography/visuals

They prefer to be charged a flat fee. What's a ball park of how much to charge? This is my first creative direction role but they seem pretty interested in my past creative work. I work in California.

If anyone has any advise that would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"
