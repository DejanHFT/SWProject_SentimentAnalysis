Was there any example of exotic animals used as battle mount historically?,ChampionshipOk4313,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/sd011h/was_there_any_example_of_exotic_animals_used_as/,564,1200,"Horses are the generic battle mount when cavalry was still a thing, with the occasional regional elephants and camels. Fantasy video games got me wonder if there was any historical record of people riding into battle with tiger, wolf or rhino or any other unconventional mount?

So my question is: was there any example of exotic animals used as battle mount historically beside those listed above?"
