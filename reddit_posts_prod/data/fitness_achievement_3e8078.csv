Achievement : 220lb squats!,Dahlia_Dee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3e8078/achievement_220lb_squats/,19,4,"Relevant info : female, no specific diet at all (i lift for fun, not really to lose weight.) I guess I'm around 5'8, 230 or so lbs.  I did isolation training for about a year then switched to the stronglifts 5x5 workout to try and up my weight. I know that's not a lot of weight to most of you but I'm super proud of myself. Was stuck at 200lbs for two months or so and finally nailed the 220 5x5 :) next goal: two plates! I'll finally feel like a badass in the gym. Comment with your achievements from this week?
Edited to add info for mods."
