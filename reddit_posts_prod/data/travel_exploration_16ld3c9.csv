5 weeks exploring Australia’s wildlife,Swiss_alps234,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/16ld3c9,19,113,"Hello everyone!

Ever since I was a kid I have been fascinated with wildlife, i had the chance in the last 10 years to experience amazing places like the Amazon rainforest, Galapagos islands, Costa Rica or a safari in East Africa. My dream as a child was to visit Australia and get to see their fauna in person. I have spent most of the time this trip in Western Australia after spending around 10 days in Cairns and a short visit to Kangaroo Valley near Sydney. I would like to share here some of my pictures (not professional) and answer some questions for anybody thinking of doing something similar.

1. Wombat, Kangaroo Valley, NSW
2. Platypus, Yungaburra, QLD
3. Cassowary, Mission beach, QLD
4. Yellow-bellied glider, near Atherton, QLD
5. Lumholtz’s Tree Kangaroo, Yungaburra, QLD
6. Herbert River Ringtail Possum, near Atherton, QLD
7. Rock Wallaby, Lake Argyle, WA
8. Black-headed python, near Tunnel Creek, WA
9. Green Tree Snake, Emma Gorge, WA
10. Humpback Whale, Exmouth, WA
11. Australian Sea Lion, Jurien Bay, WA
12. Green Sea Turtle, Ningaloo Reef, WA
13. Quokka, Rottnest island, WA
14. Octopus, Ningaloo reef, WA
 
I also saw multiple types of sharks (Whale shark, grey nurse shark, wobbegong shark, whitetip and black tip reef sharks) mainly in the ningaloo reef area, which was my favourite part of the trip.

Thank you!"
