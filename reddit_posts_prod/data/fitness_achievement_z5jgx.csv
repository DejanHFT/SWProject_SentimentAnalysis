What were your original goals and how have they changed once achieving them?,Jerry_costanza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/z5jgx/what_were_your_original_goals_and_how_have_they/,26,21,"When i starting lifting weights I was 6 foot and 145 pounds, which is quite skinny, my main goal was just to pack on size and weight. 

This was in January and my goal was 165, to me i believed that would make a huge difference in my body, but once I got there it wasn't enough, not even close. 

Now my goal is to get to 185 and who knows if that will be enough.
So what were your first goals and what are they now?"
