"Is IBM's Watson considered a Strong or Weak AI, and can we even classify AI with out truly knowing what intelligence is?",SquaredCubed,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3qdqo9/is_ibms_watson_considered_a_strong_or_weak_ai_and/,9,7,I am a Freshman Computer Science major and have been struggling to grasp what AI truly is. After learning about Watson and how he/she/it is designed to learn as a human would I figured Watson would be considered a Strong AI. I quickly learned that this is not the case according to some experts and was confused as to why. I figured that after a day of reading both side's arguments I should ask /r/askscience their opinion.
