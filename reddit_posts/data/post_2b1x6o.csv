Marriage Counselors of Reddit- Has a couple ever come in where you knew you couldn't help them?,mattyschnitz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2b1x6o/marriage_counselors_of_reddit_has_a_couple_ever/,1000,1806,"I'm just curious, had this thought driving home last night, there has to be some out there- I just picture a marriage counselor thinking ""Well, lets just try to get as many sessions in before they realize too"" 

EDIT: My favorite quote from this thread comes from /u/Liebonaut quoting Louis C.K.

“Divorce is always good news. I know that sounds weird, but it’s true because no good marriage has ever ended in divorce. It’s really that simple. That’s never happened – THAT would be sad. If two people were married and they were really happy and they just had a great thing, and then they got divorced, that would be really sad. But that has happened zero times. Literally zero.”

But with that said- it sounds like marriage counselors are very objective and try to make their clients happiest as individuals. And sometimes, that the power of the couple can dictate where they want their future, whether that be to breakup or to stay together, and that's pretty powerful.
