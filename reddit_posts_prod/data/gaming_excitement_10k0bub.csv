I just don’t get the excitement surrounding Raytracing,ReflexReact,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10k0bub/i_just_dont_get_the_excitement_surrounding/,26,0,"Everyone seems to LOVE Ratracing. Games look so much nicer with it yahdeeyah. Digital Foundary gushing at their quivvering lips.

Well - meh. It looks ok, I guess? But I am not wowwed like everyone else and I just don’t see how it’s that impressive.
