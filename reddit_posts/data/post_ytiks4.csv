"Is it theoretically possible to view someone's dreams on a screen? If so, how would this work?",Almadine1997,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ytiks4/is_it_theoretically_possible_to_view_someones/,0,5,"I guess ""mindreading"" would the the broad term for this, but I'm talking more like being able to record what someone is thinking and hearing when they are dreaming, hallucinating, or asked to imagine the image of a frog, for example. I know next to nothing about neurology, so this is probably way off, but I imagine that we'd have to first scan a person's brain so we can see what electrical impulses are occurring and where, and then we'd have to understand the function of each individual neuron or whatever, and then be able to interpret patterns from whatever the current combination of electric signals are in said person brain. Then we'd have to convert that analog information to a digital visual and auditory representation that can be displayed on a screen. But I suppose one of the biggest problems is that everyone's brain is different, so even if you could interpret one person's brain, it wouldn't work on another. You'd have to have some kind of AI that could dynamically analyze the pattern of any given person's brain and understand how it functions.

Again this is just my uninformed, speculative rambling. I'm interested to hear from more knowledgeable people how this could actually work though. The benefits of such a technology are truly mindblowing. Imagine the creative potential for art, music, fictional writing, movies, etc., if we were able to do this? Imagine being able to actually see and hear what a person experienced during a sleep paralysis episode! True horror movie potential right there. Imagine what we could learn about people with mental illness, or learn about the similarities in how we all think. And that's just the tip of the iceberg."
