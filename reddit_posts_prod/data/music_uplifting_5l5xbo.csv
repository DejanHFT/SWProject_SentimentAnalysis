Are there no uplifting metal bands or are pseudo-Christian bands the only ones?,mulierbona,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/5l5xbo/are_there_no_uplifting_metal_bands_or_are/,28,2,"I've been trying to think of any bands like Flyleaf or POD, but it seems like they're usually Christian rock. 

I've been wondering if there are any nonChristian but uplifting metal bands that actually sound good. Not like Flyleaf-sound good, but like The Bunny the Bear/Atreyu/Aramanth-sound good. "
