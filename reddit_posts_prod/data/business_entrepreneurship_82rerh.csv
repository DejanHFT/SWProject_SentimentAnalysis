USC Entrepreneurship Student in Need of Your Input for Class,TurkeyRacer,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/82rerh/usc_entrepreneurship_student_in_need_of_your/,0,1,"Hello everyone! My name is Robert Kancans. I am an undergraduate junior at the University of Southern California majoring in Astronautical Engineering and minoring in Entrepreneurship. I need input for my capstone entrepreneurship class and would be elated if y'all would answer this quick survey to help gain insight into the crowdfunding community. It will only take a minute or two. For clarification, this is NOT a survey for the purpose of self-promotion and it is NOT for a particular campaign. The information gathered is purely for academic purposes and responses will not be used for anything outside of this particular class.

The study is regarding crowdfunding, specifically StartEngine. If you have any insight into the platform, or other crowdfunding platforms, I would greatly appreciate your input!
