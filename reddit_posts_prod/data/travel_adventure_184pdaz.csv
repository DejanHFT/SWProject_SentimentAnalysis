Egypt Tour - G Adventures vs Intrepid Hotels,TealDragon2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/184pdaz/egypt_tour_g_adventures_vs_intrepid_hotels/,4,2,"I am looking into a \~14 day Egypt tour with either G Adventures or Intrepid. I've heard good things about both companies, and the itineraries look similar. I don't typically travel with tour groups but since I am a solo female traveler, I think it makes sense to try out a group for this specific destination. 

My main concern is the hotels. The G Adventures tour style is Classic and the comparable Intrepid tour is the Basix style. G Adventures gives you the name of a possible hotel to give you an idea of the type of accommodation in each location. I looked up each one and they seem okay. Looks like most if not all are passable but in need of repair and have a few concerning reviews. Looking up those hotels makes me wonder what the Intrepid Basix accommodations would be.  Has anyone taken either of these tours in the classic (G Adventures) or Basix (Intrepid) and would be able to share their experience with the accommodations? 

There is also a 12 day Comfort style tour offered through Intrepid, but I don't love that it removes Hurghada from the itinerary. But I may be willing to consider more seriously if the accommodations would be a large improvement. If anyone has been on a Comfort style Intrepid tour in Egypt, please let me know what you thought!
