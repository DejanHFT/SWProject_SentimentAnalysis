-What I do? I create poster designs, logos(when neededðŸ¥´), titlecard designing, photography(a lil bit) & comic art

Hey there! I've been creating art and designing since my senior year of high school in 2019. I'm not sure if this is the right group to ask, but I thought I'd give it a shot! I'm interested in pursuing a few things creative-wise but first I really want to get into poster designing for movies or promotional art. I've done a few commissions here and there and even learned how to create my first motion title a few years ago (thankfully, I was given the trust to do that). I've worked with both my iPad and computer, but my computer was down for half a year, so I was just using my iPad for some time. Recently, I got an iMac in July and redownloaded all of my Adobe software. I really want to get into doing more consistent commissions, creating content, and working up to freelancing. I was curious about where to go with that with getting creative jobs? I learn from art books PDFs, Pinterest folders saved with ideas/inspirations, some subscription classes and YouTube folders of creative tips and tutorials. I'm grateful for any help I can get. I just really want to create dope shit for a living and be happy Iâ€™m just mentally not happy with where Iâ€™m at now and stuckðŸ¥´"
