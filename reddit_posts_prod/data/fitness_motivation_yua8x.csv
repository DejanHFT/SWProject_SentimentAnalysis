your motivation?,Whitewolf255,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/yua8x/your_motivation/,37,5,"Over last year or so I have gotten way out of shape. Today I did one of the hardest hikes I have ever done. At the top of the mountain I took a picture of my self. Seeing my gut bulging out and emphasized by my backpack, I have never been more motivated to get back in shape. What has been your motivation?"
