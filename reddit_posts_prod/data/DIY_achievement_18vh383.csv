Mounting Display on Wall,Medium_Efficiency979,https://i.redd.it/nc9f9lpb3p9c1.jpeg,11,0,"Hey all. I've got this display/carry case that I want to mount on the wall and be able to easily remove it but also be sure it doesn't remove itself from the wall. If anyone has thoughts on a design that would be simple and relatively inexpensive to achieve, that would be super helpful."
