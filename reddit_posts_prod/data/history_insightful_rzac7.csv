I realised today I don't have a clue about the supposed story of Jesus. Care to fill me in?,lapsedcatholicmang,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/rzac7/i_realised_today_i_dont_have_a_clue_about_the/,52,10,"Hey guys,

 I realised today that my knowledge of the whole story is vague at best. Maybe some religious scholars might be able to give an insight?

My (admittedly almost child like) questions are as follows:

(1) Is there anything written about what point Jesus declared he was son of God? I mean, did his mam tell him once he was old enough? Or did he apparently just know? Is there any written record of this?

(2) What did Jesus do for his teenage years? Or is that just a blank gap? 

(3) What's the story with Mary Mag. Who was she and why do some people think they make have been romantically involved? 

(4) What was the last recorded instance Jesus talked to his disciples and what were his last words? I know they put him in the cave after the cross and then the boulder was apparently moved and they added 2+2 together.. and then at some point doesn't he rise and float into the sky (Or did I imagine this entirely?).. well, what happened between these points? I'm confused about this entire sequence.

(5) What happened to Mary and Joseph after Jesus died? Does the narrative just stop? Surely there's some records?

(6) What age was Jesus when he was crucified?

That's about it. 

Looking forward to any insights you can provide based. These aren't faith based questions per se, that's why I'm posting here rather than /r/christianity or whatever. I'd just love to know what kind of picture various historical sources paint.

Thanks gents! "
