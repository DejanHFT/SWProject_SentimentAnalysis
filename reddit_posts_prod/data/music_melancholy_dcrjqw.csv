Songs for A Melancholy Playlist,devinitely_,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/dcrjqw/songs_for_a_melancholy_playlist/,2,0,"I'm looking for more songs to add to my current melancholy playlist. Songs that evoke feeling, give you chills etc. The kind of music you listen to while laying in bed staring at the ceiling. Here are some songs I currently have:

* The Barr Brothers - You would have to lose your mind
* M83 - My tears are becoming the sea
* M83 - Un Nouveau Soleil
* Massive Attack - Teardrop
* Justin Timberlake - Blue Ocean Floor 
* The Cinematic Orchestra - To Believe (Feat. Moses Sumney)
* XXXTENTACION - what are you so afraid of
* Sufjan Stevens - Visions of Gideon
* Death Cab for Cutie - Transatlanticism
* Winters Aid - The Wisp Sings

My taste is all over the place. But I'm really into instrumentals/indie/alt/electronic type songs. Anyone else have similar tastes? Any recommendations?"
