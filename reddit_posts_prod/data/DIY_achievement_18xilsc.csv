Best temporary room partition to divide a room that actually feels/looks like a wall?,SensitiveTheory8544,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/18xilsc/best_temporary_room_partition_to_divide_a_room/,3,1,"Seeking advice on soundproofing and enhancing privacy for a den in my rental apartment. Closing off one wall would essentially turn it into a room. With my mother-in-law moving in temporarily for health reasons, we want to make it as soundproof and private as possible. Any suggestions for achieving this in a rental setting?"
