What's the biggest obstacle keeping us developing warp drive technology?,mightyugly,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2lu4di/whats_the_biggest_obstacle_keeping_us_developing/,32,35,I've heard warp drive kinda-sorta possible in the fact that it doesn't break any of Einstein's theories like FTL travel does. So why haven't I heard about anyone working to develop it? What difficulties are keeping us from moving forward?
