I just finished reading all of the Sci-Fi on Reddit's 200 most recommended books,salydra,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9it4if/i_just_finished_reading_all_of_the_scifi_on/,1241,15465,"I have always been a sci-fi fan, but it always bothered me whenever I saw a list of the best Sci-Fi (according to whoever) and I'd read (or even heard of) so few of them. Over the better part of the past decade I've collected names of books and notable lists of best Sci-Fi and have been slowly increasing the number of books I've read that are considered the best of my favourite genre. It's been great and I have no intention of stopping!

About 2-3 years ago I decided to take on [Reddit's most recommended Sci-Fi](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/fiction#wiki_science-fiction). There were several books that I'd already read, and a bunch I'd never even heard of, and since I'm a Redditor, and the list overlaps with a lot of other lists that I mentioned above, I decided I'd go for completion. Ultimately It's a partial completion, since some of the recommendations are for a full series and there are some that I only read Book 1 rather than the whole series, but with that one caveat, as of the other day, when I made it to the last page of *The Book of Ler*, I have officially completed the list!

I just wanted to mark the occasion by sharing some thoughts, joys, and disappointments with everyone here:

**A Fire Upon the Deep** Is an absolute stand out. I had no idea what to expect. I'd never heard of Vernor Vinge so it's one of those books that when I'd see it on a list, it just never stuck out for me. Basically, it blew my mind. It's rare to come across the perfect triple threat of world-building, plot, and characters but I don't think I'd be over-stating it if I said this one got high marks on all three. It is now one of my favorite books.

**Book of the New Sun** inspires ambivalent feelings. I read *Shadow & Claw* which is actually 2 of 4 books in the series. If I'd stopped after the first book, I'd probably have just written it off as not my thing/overrated and moved on, but I finished the second, and while it never fully drew me, by the end I was interested in finding out more about what was going on. I might read the rest of the series, but it holds a weird place for me where I have interest without enjoyment.

**Cloud Atlas** is a great example of interesting writing. I'm probably not alone in having difficulty staying immersed with the frequent change in setting, but I can say that once I got through the first half, I couldn't put it down. 

**The Mote in God's Eye** was... interesting. I wanted to call it out because it has some issues that I've been running into a lot with sci-fi from the 60s and 70s that's increasingly difficult to ignore. *The Mote in God's Eye* features a single female human who serves 2 purposes: to be a love interest and to explain (a super conservative version of) human reproduction to aliens. I guess I'm supposed to overlook that and just enjoy the story about aliens, but I have a hard time believing that in 1974 neither of the two authors knew what they were doing when they included a passage explaining why there were no women allowed on space missions.

**Red Mars** is just awesome. I can't remember if I read it before or after I committed to this list, but it stands out either way. It's a legitimate must-read in the genre and since I've read the trilogy, I intend to read more by Kim Stanley Robinson.

**The Saga of Seven Suns** is one that I was not familiar with (although I've read several books by Kevin J. Anderson) and wasn't sure what to expect. I only read the first book, but I'm definitely open to reading the rest at some point. There's a lot of world-building and it promises to be a large epic the likes of which you typically expect in the Fantasy genre. It's not my favorite on the list, but it's certainly enjoyable enough and introduces some interesting ideas about aliens and interstellar diplomacy. 

Thanks for reading my mini treatise :)

EDIT: *obligatory edit about how I can't believe how much this blew up and I'm trying to keep up with my inbox and I'll eventually need to go to bed*
Fixed a mistake that only one hardcore superfan called me out on - the rest of you can never judge me now!
