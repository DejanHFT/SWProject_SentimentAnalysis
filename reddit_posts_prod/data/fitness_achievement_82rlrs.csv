Would push up planks help me to achieve a push up?,SailorVeganx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/82rlrs/would_push_up_planks_help_me_to_achieve_a_push_up/,25,34,"Hey, I'm a 20 year old female.
I literally can not do a fucking push up. I can do kneeling push ups but over the weeks it's done nothing to help towards doing an actual push up. 
I've tried elevation but that doesn't work either. 
My main issue is just pushing myself off the ground. 
I'm wondering of it's my boobs that are partly weighing me down? my spongebob arms are no help either. 

ANYWAY TO THE POINT: my brother let me try his push up grips. I was able to push myself up off the ground to a plank position. If I were to do this daily would I slowly work my way to doing a god forsaken push up? Or are plank push ups pointless? My arms feel like lead especially my shoulders. Is this progress or what? 
Much obliged. 

TL:DR I'm spongebob with big boobs, would plank push ups help with push ups on the future? "
