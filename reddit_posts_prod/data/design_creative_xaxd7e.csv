wanted: tips on making design/creative thinking classes more interesting and inclusive,radio_polaroid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/xaxd7e/wanted_tips_on_making_designcreative_thinking/,11,1,"Hii i just started teaching design &creative thinking to 17 -18 year olds. This includes things like divergent and convergent thinking brainstorming etc. Along with this I need to encourage them to sketch and keep expressing themselves through sketches and artforms. 
Please give me some tips and advice that have helped in your design career/ education. And also how to make it into small interactive activities which all kinds of students find interesting to participate in."
