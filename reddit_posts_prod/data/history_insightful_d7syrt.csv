"Around 560-546 B.C., King Croesus of ancient Lydia began issuing Gold coins for general circulation for the first time in history. I'm interested in knowing more details about this initiative, particularly how he proceeded to do it. Hf, some interesting insights about cryptocurrencies will emerge.",agasabellaba,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/d7syrt/around_560546_bc_king_croesus_of_ancient_lydia/,14,12," Money is very interesting to me. It's a source of philosophical discussions even sometimes. I have been following cryptocurrencies news for the past 3 years now, and when I stumbled across this King Croesus fact I wondered if he could ever have to teach us how, or what is necessary, for money to be adopted widely. For example, what does it mean to have a fair distribution of money? and is it really necessary for the money to be distributed equally to jump start the network? Was the money given to buyers only? Was it given to people as loans to increase adoption?"
