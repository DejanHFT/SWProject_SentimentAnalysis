Jordan Peele's 'Us' - Review Thread,BunyipPouch,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/az3f3x/jordan_peeles_us_review_thread/,594,1238,"*Us* premiered at SXSW last night and reviews are starting to come out. Looks like another insanely good movie from Peele. Great reviews from across the board, apparently really scary and does some unexpected stuff. Not quite the acclaim *Get Out* got, but close. I expect this to do 50M+ opening weekend. Careful clicking the Variety review, they usually have spoilers, I didn't check.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/03/us-review-jordan-peele-sxsw-1202049907/) - *Eric Kohn*

> A brilliant home-invasion thriller laced with cultural reference points stretching back to the late ’80s, and a smorgasbord of first-rate visceral cinematic scares. Think “Funny Games” collided with Cronenbergian body horror and Hitchockian suspense, and you’re maybe halfway there. 

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/us-review-1193550) - *John DeFore*

> Clearly the work of an ambitious writer/director who can see himself inheriting the mantle of Rod Serling ... it offers twists and ironies and false endings galore — along with more laughs than the comedian-turned-auteur dared to include in his debut film. ... It packs a punch.

[The A.V. Club](https://film.avclub.com/jordan-peeles-get-out-follow-up-us-is-thrilling-creepy-1833170882) - *Randall Colburn*

> Us is something of a frustrating watch, a visual and technical marvel that just doesn’t seem to know what it is. Unlike Get Out, which only swelled in impact as you left the theater, Us is best viewed on a visceral level, not an intellectual one.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/us-review-jordan-peele-1203158604/) - *Peter Debruge*

> Terrifying...The less you know going in — and the less energy you spend thinking about it after the fact — the better the movie works, trading on some uncanny combination of Peele’s imagination and our own to suggest a horror infinitely larger and more insidious than the film is capable of representing

[We Live Entertainment](https://weliveentertainment.com/welivefilm/sxsw-2019-us-review/) - *Ashley Menzel*

> Breathtakingly haunting and in a way, surreal, Us is a must-see that will horrify audiences the world over.

[Dread Central](https://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/290731/sxsw-2019-us-review-jordan-peeles-latest-nightmare-delivers-the-goods/) - *Jonathan Barkan*

> Jordan Peele's Us is one of the most original horror titles in recent years. This movie is destined for greatness.

[Vanyaland](https://vanyaland.com/2019/03/08/sxsw-review-us-is-another-stunner-from-jordan-peele/) - *Nick Johnston* 

> Us is a tremendous accomplishment.

[CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/us-review-peele-again-fuses-horror-with-a-social-message/) - *Erin Carson*

> Similarly, Us mirrors Get Out. It's more scary fare with social commentary. But the copy's never quite the same as the original.

[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/jordan-peeles-us-is-a-stellar-follow-up-to-get-out-and-going-to-be-a-huge-hit) - *Kevin Fallon*

> Jordan Peele's Us is a stellar follow-up to Get Out and its going to be a huge hit.
