Just got a PS5. Can't decide between excitement and guilt.,psychgamerr,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17p8wxe/just_got_a_ps5_cant_decide_between_excitement_and/,102,0,"Hey guys, 

I've been wanting a ps5 for years now. 
I just made a purchase yesterday and now I feel like I did an impulsive act.
I'm not sure if anyone else feels that way.  I'm working full time and I don't know how much time I'll have for this but I' also have been wanting to get this since launch. 

I just feel like I spent money I could've saved. I still have savings but does anyone else feel like may be it was too much for spending for own entertainment. 
I'm not sure what to say. 

Just wanted to share my thoughts."
