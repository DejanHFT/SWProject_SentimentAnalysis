Help: 10 min uplifting modern song,NotYourEverydayHero,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/uw9a2p/help_10_min_uplifting_modern_song/,7,2,"Hello! I have been doing a 1 Second Everyday video for my son’s first year. He is currently 6 months old and the video is 4mins long so I am anticipating that the video will be around 10mins by the time he is a year old. 

I’ve found some 10 min long pieces to accompany the video but their either old fashioned classical or a little sad. 

I was wondering if you knew of any uplifting pieces around 10mins long that might fit the bill? 

Thank you!

Edit: songs we’ve played around with.
1. Somewhere over the rainbow - Isreal Kamakawiwo’ole - 3m31 (perfect but too short)

2. All too well (10min version) - Taylor swift (too sad) 

3. I Giorni - Ludovico Einaudi (6 mins) - too sad"
