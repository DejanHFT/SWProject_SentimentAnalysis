"I want to attach my ring light with a 1/4"" thread to my mic stand with a 3/8"" screw thread. What's the best hassle free course of action to achieve this?",Sonyapop,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/t22dgl/i_want_to_attach_my_ring_light_with_a_14_thread/,11,5,"I tried searching for thread adapters, but all I found are female to female reducers. The ones I found for 3/8"" to 1/4"" female to male are expensive and from obscure website. Maybe my search terms are worded poorly. I tried thinking of ways to attach the light, but they're rather convoluted in my mind."
