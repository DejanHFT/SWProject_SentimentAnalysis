Why AREN'T you excited for GTA6?,Envy661,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/18b9c0y/why_arent_you_excited_for_gta6/,198,0,"For the very tiny minority of players who just don't care, what is the reason? What brought you to this point? Was it the lack of interest in the IP as a whole, or the direction of Rockstar the company? 

This is meant to purely be an open discussion about criticisms and weariness surrounding Rockstar's latest project. This is not meant to be just straight up hate on GTA, the franchise or this latest installment. This is not meant as a place for political debate, so please keep political reasoning out of it. If your reason is indeed political, please just say it is ""It's political"" and leave it at that. 

Now for my stance:

I've been playing GTA since I was a kid. When I say that, I mean I owned the original top-down Grand Theft Auto for the Sony Playstation. This was a series I loved, and played on and off. While I have not played every GTA game, I have played most, including Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories for the PSP. I had GTA IV for the 360, and got GTA V when it finally came to PC. 

For me personally, the reasons I am not excited for GTA 6 is because of the success of GTAV, and seeing how negatively that affected Rockstar. 

I loved playong GTA Online back in the day. I loved just dicking around in the experience, not really for the goal of doing anything, but just because I could. Back in the early days, the online car markets weren't super bloated with cars worth 10-50x more than their IRL counterparts. That's kind of where my criticisms start. 

The game always had a small sense of exaggerated grind to push shark cards, but with the success of Online, the grind grew exponentially worse as time went on. Once upon a time, the super yacht was considered the biggest waste of hard earned money in the game. Something you'd aspire to get after beating everything else. Nothing was more expensive than it, save for a single gold-played jet, that honestly I can't even remember if it came after or at the same time. 

The point is, this yacht, of which the top tier one cost 8 million to start, became a drop in the bucket compared to unlocks that came later. We've had items costing in the tens of millions added to this game. What was once considered the be all end all property (in terms of cost) was suddenly not even in the top 5. While many of these layer additions added a lot of actual gameplay and story content to go with them, the fact remained that the egregious cost and hugely inflated grind just got worse and worse. 

Enter Red Dead Redemption 2, which took all these aspects of GTA Online and threw them into Red Dead's online. Compared to the single player, you'd get less for looting corpses, and all weapons cost substantially more, with some requiring a new standalone premium currency - gold, to buy. Many may wonder why this matters, because there should be some kind of expectation that the online is going to be grinder, but many of them forget GTA started with prices reflecting the single player as well. 

This would not be the first or last time Rockstar intentionally made the online for RDR2 more grindy. The other came later, when they took the daily challenge system, which awarded a decimal's worth of gold per completion (0.2 bars, increasing if you continued logging in to collect dailies every day) and halved the value, as well as forced a hard reset on your modifier after you hit the max tier for dailies. Now, some blame gold farmers for this, as by the time this fix was thrown in, some players had accumulated thousands of bars simply by playing every single day, but it's important to note the timing of this change came fairly close to when they basically stopped updating and abandoned the game, meaning the only point of it was to make the experience worse for players who continued to play after that point and didn't farm all that gold. 

RDR2 also had a season pass, but honestly, I'm neither for nor against season passes. My only major ""Against"" is the FOMO they induce unless they're handled like Halo (Ie always available to purchase if you missed one). 

Not long after this though is when Rockstar introduced a straight up subscription service to GTA Online, and hearing about this was the final nail in the coffin for my care about the IP. It just felt like all Rockstar cared about squeezing as much money from it's user base as possible, and it concerns me how this will translate to the quality of GTA6. 

I have no doubt whatever single player GTA6 has will be great. That is one thing Rockstar excels at. Red Dead Redemption is my favorite IP by them, and one of my favorite IPs in general for this reason (minus the online). What I worry about however is how utterly hyperbolic the grind will be in the game. I have loved the online play in Rockstar games since GTA4. I love creating my character and RPing living in these places. It feels like, with everything Rockstar has put out in GTA and RDR2, That it will be an almost soul-crushing grind just to get off the ground in 6.


I truly hope my worst fears aren't realized, but it just feels like Rockstar has taken a very profits over people stance on their monetization every since the widespread success of GTAV years back, and it has sucked away all optimizim I have for GTA6. WIth Starfield, I was cautiously optimistic given Bethesda's direction, but with GTA, I am just cautious."
