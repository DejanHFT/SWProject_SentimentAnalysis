"As a newbie with motivation issues, I've found a solution that works great for me!",KohokuJack,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/18h94u/as_a_newbie_with_motivation_issues_ive_found_a/,33,129,"As a generally out of shape lump, I've always had issues getting into a habit of working out.  My problem is that, with *anything* I do in life, I tend to do too much right off the bat.  With exercise, I won't just start running a kilometer every other day and work from there ...  I'll start running to my absolute breaking point, multiple times a week, followed by about 30 minutes (at least) of weight-lifting.

This is good for people that have developed the lifestyle, but I was consistently burning out after a week or so.  As a beginner, I was over-exhausting myself and training myself to HATE work-out time.  It was too easy to find an excuse not to find an hour of time during the day to do something I really despised.

Anyway, recently my friends and I (at varying levels of fitness), created a Facebook group.  Every other day, a different person in the group has to post a 10-15 minute intense workout plan.  For example, on Monday, the routine was:  10 burpees, 15 crunches, and 20 squats for as many sets as you can crank out in 10-15 minutes -- some people only got 3 sets, some got 5 or 6.  On Wednesday, the PX90 Ab-Ribber workout with push-ups between each set -- some people had to cut the 25 reps down to 10, but the goal was to finish the video.  Friday, someone will probably post an upper body workout.

I **love** this system because we're motivating each other without having to take the time to meet.  We're posting our results, posting before (and eventually after) pictures, and getting a variety of ideas and exercise routines from each other that we probably wouldn't otherwise have.  Most importantly I think, it's a sensible ""start"" for me.  I literally can't make an excuse to not do a 10-15 minute workout, especially when I see ten other people busier than me finding time to do it.

Anyway, I'm no expert and I'm sure there are more efficient ways to getting in shape, but I wanted to tell you what has been working for me:  Get a group of like-minded friends, make a FB group with a silly name, arrange end-of-month meetups for fun, and get cracking."
