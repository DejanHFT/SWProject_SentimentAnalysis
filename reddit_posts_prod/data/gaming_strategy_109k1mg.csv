How are Turn-Based Strategy Game Level Created?,ichwillkeineNummer,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/109k1mg/how_are_turnbased_strategy_game_level_created/,3,2,"(Fristly english isnt my native language, so please excuse me)
I thought about this, because a friend and I were jokingly brainstorming about what game we want to create (neither of us can can program, so it‘s just a fantasy).
The only answer to my question I can think of is „when it’s not a tutorial level, just put enemies in it who become stronger in every level and let the player solve it themself“
But this cant be the right answer. 
I googled but I couldnt find an answer.

Thank you in advance"
