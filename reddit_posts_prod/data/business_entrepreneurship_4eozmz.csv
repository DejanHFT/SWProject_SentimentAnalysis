Entrepreneurship Class,Nh66532,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/4eozmz/entrepreneurship_class/,2,0,My 3 other classmates are in a group for a business class and we came up with our business and I haven't been as invested into the group due to me being sick the last few weeks and me having to catch up on all the work i missed as well as working. They want to kick me out of the company for this. Would I have any defense against something like this?
