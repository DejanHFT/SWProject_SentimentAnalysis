"City Builder Strategies without DLC, season passes or microtransactions?",MisterGuyMan23,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/16w6i5i/city_builder_strategies_without_dlc_season_passes/,20,6,"As someone totally new to the city builder & strategy genre, it seems like every game comes with 10 mandatory DLCs, 50 cosmetics packs and god knows what else.

Are there any good recent (<10 years old) singleplayer games of this genre that I can just... buy without the prospect of spending more money on them?"
