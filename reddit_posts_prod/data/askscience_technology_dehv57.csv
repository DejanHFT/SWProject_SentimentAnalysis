"AskScience AMA Series: We're Rob Dagle, Bob Wegeng, and Richard Zheng - experts in extracting low carbon hydrogen from natural gas from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and STARS, LLC. We're here to answer your questions. AUA!",AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/dehv57/askscience_ama_series_were_rob_dagle_bob_wegeng/,83,730,"Hi Reddit, tomorrow is National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day, and we hope you'll have a gas! Hydrogen and fuel cells are the perfect partners for clean, fuel-efficient transportation and a secure energy future. Here at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), we have expertise in creating low carbon hydrogen from natural gas, and we have two projects we want to discuss with you. The first is Solar Thermochemical Advanced Reactor System-or STARS, a technology that converts a record-setting 70 percent of solar energy into chemical energy, such as hydrogen. STARS uses thermal energy from the sun to break down natural gas and water into hydrogen and carbon dioxide in a steam methane reforming process. PNNL licensed STARS to a spin-off company, STARS, LLC, who is working with Southern California Gas Company to implement the technology.

The second project uses a low-emission process to convert natural gas to hydrogen, carbon fiber, and carbon nanotubes. The process creates hydrogen that can be used in fuel cell vehicles and industrial processes, as well as carbon fiber that can be used in applications from medical devices and aerospace structures to building products. The goal of the project is to make hydrogen-fueled cars and trucks cost-competitive with conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles. In addition, this technology would virtually eliminate CO2 emissions from the methane-to-hydrogen process. The technology development and commercialization team includes PNNL; West Virginia University; Southern California Gas Company; and C4-MCP, a Santa Monica-based start-up company.

We invite you to look over the information in these links, and we will be back at 11-1 PDT (2-4 ET, UT) to answer your questions."
