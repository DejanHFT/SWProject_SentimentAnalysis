Why is it so hard to find a historical documentary on the life of the prophet Muhammad?,marabelec,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/59h6dt/why_is_it_so_hard_to_find_a_historical/,201,305,"I have asked it elsewhere without much of a success, so I though maybe /r/history would be  a more appropriate place.

The thing is that I am looking for some historical documentary on the life of the prophet Mohammed, as critical and as secular as possible. It seems there is not a lot of material like that out there. I have tried the [PBS](http://www.pbs.org/muhammad/) and the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012mkh7/episodes/guide) ones but they proselytize too much to my taste (the [muslim fireman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spfXfwKQfcI), really) and I think they are way too biased. The BBC one even starts with the ""peace be upon him"" thing, so I am not to convinced of its historical value. 
If any of you know of any other, please share! Thanks in advance."
