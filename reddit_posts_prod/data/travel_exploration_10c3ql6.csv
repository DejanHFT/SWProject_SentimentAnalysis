5 hour layover in SEA… DL lounge or explore?,Jabramsaar,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/10c3ql6/5_hour_layover_in_sea_dl_lounge_or_explore/,22,6,"Hi there! 
Next week we are taking our parents (mine & in-laws) to Hawaii. We have a 5 hour and 15 min layover in Seattle (thanks DL schedule change) and we’re contemplating leaving the airport for a short excursion. Otherwise we’ll spend the time in a lounge. 
1) Do we really have the time to leave, and if so, what would you recommend seeing? 
2) Which lounge is better; Centurion or Sky Club Concourse A?"
