"To get ""bigger"" abs, is progressive overload necessary, or can this be achieved through more repetitions",gottapoopASAP,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9pgqim/to_get_bigger_abs_is_progressive_overload/,53,84,"I know progressive overload is key to promoting muscle growth (assuming diet, posture, and all other factors are proper), but with abs, how can you achieve PO if most ab exercises are solely bodyweight. Lets use sit ups, and hanging leg raises for example, will doing more repetitions of these result in growth of the ab muscle, or does it need more resistance to enable any sort of reasonable growth. By the way, I train abs every day, and while it *feels* like I'm making progress in that area, I'm sure I could still use plenty of advice to implement a more efficient routine. 

This post isn't about ab visibility, I know that comes from dieting, it's about literally just about making them larger. Anyways, thanks in advance for any replies."
