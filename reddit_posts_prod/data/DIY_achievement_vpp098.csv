"Floating deck to solve a problem, but is it safe?",WobagUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/vpp098/floating_deck_to_solve_a_problem_but_is_it_safe/,146,510,"At the rear of our house we have a patio that has over the years become very disturbed by tree roots, and isnt that safe to walk on if you are not too steady.  Now top level solution was  have the patio taken out, the roots removed, and the patio relaid, but Im not looking for that kind of investment or hassle right now.

I have instead, designed a floating deck over the affected area, approx 3m x 3.6m, supported by concrete blocks on unaffected areas.  Standard construction, 2x6 joists, 16""gap, pressure treated boards etc etc.

However it really needs to be edge supported only, to avoid the possibility of centre supports being pushed by the roots that cause the problem in the first place.

**Is there a maximum span achievable without centre supports?** 

**Are there structural additions that would facilitate the required span?**

Without going into detail, Im limited in the height of the structure to 29cm (11 1/2"") This lends itself to:

10cm concrete block support (giving 10cm of clearance for future movement of the patio

15cm / 6"" joists, 

3.5cm grooved decking boards

...and not much left to spare
