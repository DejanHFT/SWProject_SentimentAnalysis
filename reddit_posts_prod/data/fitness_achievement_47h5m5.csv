What would it take to achieve this look?,LemmeTakeASelphiroth,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/47h5m5/what_would_it_take_to_achieve_this_look/,35,6,"Hello! I know that this question is likely extremely difficult to answer not knowing my body personally, but let's say I am a 5'6"", 130 lbs skinnyfat teen male. I have no pecs, only smaller moobs, and only *very* slight stomach distinction underneath the fat layer. How much  work and diet change would be required to get a look like http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/10/article-0-18A35E0400000578-849_634x705.jpg or http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/06/25/article-2348480-1A58560E000005DC-458_634x622.jpg or https://cdnd.lystit.com/photos/d638-2014/04/08/versace-collection-black-greek-key-boxer-briefs-product-1-19035308-0-561243911-normal.jpeg ? Those are  some examples of the sort of body type I would want to have, the ""effortless"" looking not overweight/not crazy fit look. The thing is I am sure much more work goes into this look than I would think but I have no idea as to how know what these people do to obtain looks like this. If this question goes against the code of conduct for this subreddit I do apologize, I believe it fits within the confines of the rule summary but I could be mistaken (first time posting here.) Thank you!
