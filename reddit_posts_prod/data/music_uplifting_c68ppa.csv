Im trying to keep it mainly pop/hip hop 

Some of the songs I have down to set the tone for it are - 

So Good by B.O.B (def one of my favs)

Cheerleader by OMI 

Ayo by Chris Brown ft Tyga 

Where R Ü Now by Jack Ü ft Justin Bieber 

Relatively any songs that have that care free party type music feel, nothing sad or too heavy please! 

Thanks and feel free to comment so I can make this thing lit"
