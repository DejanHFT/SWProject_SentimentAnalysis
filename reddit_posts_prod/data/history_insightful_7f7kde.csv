"How come European diseases killed many Native Americans, but not Africans?",gobrowns1,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7f7kde/how_come_european_diseases_killed_many_native/,566,5103,"I've always wondered how come Sub-Saharan Africans didn't die on the scale Aboriginals did from contact with European diseases. Like I know there was contact between Europeans and North Africans, but from what I understand, there wasn't much contact between Sub-Saharan Africans not living along the coasts.

Any insight would help. "
