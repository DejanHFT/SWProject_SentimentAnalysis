How come my gym gainz don't transfer super well to real world gainz?,rigidly,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4zqyqf/how_come_my_gym_gainz_dont_transfer_super_well_to/,25,0,"How come I can squat and deadlift 225+ (up from ~100), etc, and have gained all this muscle mass since I've started working out, but I can still barely move furniture or carry the heavy luggage around like how my dad and grandpa do, even though I know I'm stronger if were going by gym numbers? Is dad strength a real thing? Am I just not used to hurling things around like they do? what gives people???"
