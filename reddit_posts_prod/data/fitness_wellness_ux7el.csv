"Well, this sucks.",edhughesiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ux7el/well_this_sucks/,13,0,"Hey people. I was at the gym earlier today, and I had an unfortunate realization.  I've found that whenever I'm about to start a set of any exercise I think to myself, ""Well, this is gonna suck."" I believe this kind of thinking might be hurting my workout, so I was wondering if any of you could recommend a better, more motivational thought to start a set off? I would really appreciate it.  

TL;DR 
in need of motivational phrase to keep me going"
