Transitioning from corporate to business/entrepreneurship,quizoola,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/10jw89m/transitioning_from_corporate_to/,1,1,"I’m frustrated working for “the man” and I’m keen to hear from people who’ve made the transition from being an employee to an entrepreneur/business owner. 

What was your main motivation in making the transition? 

What was the hardest part of making the transition?

How did you learn how to be an entrepreneur/business owner? What sources did you use to support your learning (eg. Books? Mentors? Short courses? Google?) How did you know whose advice to trust?"
