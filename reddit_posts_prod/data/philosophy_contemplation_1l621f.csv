The Aesthetics of Mathematics,PostFunktionalist,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1l621f/the_aesthetics_of_mathematics/,22,5,"One of the things people say about mathematics is that it's ""beautiful""; a Russell quote says it better than I could:
>Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beautyâ€”a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry. 

So: in what sense is mathematics beautiful? Other kinds of beauty we can ""see"" or ""hear"" but mathematical beauty seems to be experienced simply through contemplation. Can it be said that it's a different kind of beauty? Or that the kind of ""conceptual appreciation"" found in the apprehension of mathematical beauty is common to all other forms of beauty?

Since I've posed a lot of questions I'll give some conjectures: Mathematical structures are the bearers of the aesthetic value - it's not the number that's beautiful but the omega-structure as a whole. The appreciation of a structure is primitive in our understanding of beauty, and all other ""empirical"" forms of beauty are rooted in the conceptual appreciation of the structures conveyed to our senses - it is this structural appreciation which I'm referring to when I say ""conceptual appreciation.""

(whether or not mathematical beauty is subjective or objective is a lot harder to discuss so I'm not going to deal with that. your ontology might suggest different directions of inquiry but is mostly a disjoint consideration, so please don't start arguing whether maths do real)"
