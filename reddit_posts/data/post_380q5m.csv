"TIL one of ""The Who"" drummer Keith Moon's drunken hobbies was to flush powerful fireworks down hotel toilets. This hobby began in 1965 when he purchased a case of 500 cherry bombs. He moved from cherry bombs to M-80 fireworks to sticks of dynamite and continued until his death in 1978.",tensaiteki19,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Moon#Destructive_behaviour,14,66,No text content
