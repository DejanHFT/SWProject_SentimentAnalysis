How to make a box with a homemade lock,imdanishtoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/17qtf67/how_to_make_a_box_with_a_homemade_lock/,1,0,"Hi! I hope this is the right place to ask.

I want to make a box with a lock that can be unlocked with one of the pieces from the ""Cast Puzzle: Harmony"" puzzle. The idea is that the person receiving this first solves the puzzle, then uses the piece to open a box where a gift is.

I have very little DIY experience, so I have no idea where to begin, or if it's even feasible. Any advice would be welcome."
