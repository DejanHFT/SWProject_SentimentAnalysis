What should I [33M] do about un supportive family?,JustYrStandardUser,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/uilqix/what_should_i_33m_do_about_un_supportive_family/,6,2,"I \[33m\] have for the past several years now, I've struggled to get the bottom of chronic health symptoms that have proven difficult to figure out.

Early on, when I ran into a brick wall with my then current doctor, I went to my parents for support since I knew that I wasn't imagining it and I was getting fed up with having to deal with this problem. I went to them expecting that they would take my side and support me 100%. 

I was wrong. My mother listened to me at first but my father was almost completely tone-deaf about it. When I explained to him what was going on and how I was feeling and he said 'well it could be you have XZY go to your doctor and see what he says'. But after I went to the doctor and the doctor told me that he didn't find anything wrong with me, he completely turned on me. Any time I would bring up my health he would always play contrarian to whatever it was I had to say, always taking the opposing side. Didn't matter if he understood or not, he would always find a way to argue. Anyone else have a troubling dynamic like this? What do you do about it?

Trying to talk to my mom about it is fruitless, she's a lush and doesn't remember half of what you talk to her about and my sibling is a total mercenary who only calls when it serves her interests first... I guess I just needed to get this off of my chest. Anyone else have a troubling dynamic like this?   
 

TLDR: I'm \[33M\] struggling with my relationship with my parents in regards to health issues I've been having. They have been unsupportive for several years now. Has anyone else dealt with this? What are your thoughts?"
