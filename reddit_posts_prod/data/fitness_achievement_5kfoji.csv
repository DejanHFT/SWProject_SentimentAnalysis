Which program to achieve my goals?,fandangofit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5kfoji/which_program_to_achieve_my_goals/,9,1,"Have been exercising for a while, but not achieved my desired goals. I'm aiming for toned body, abs, clear athletic muscle definition.

Progress pics over last 2 years at https://m.imgur.com/FFcIioy?r

I have made good strength gains with 5x5 stronglifts but have gained too much fat for my liking and not enough muscle - I know its a strength program, not hypertrophy or fat loss.

Do I now:

1) Continue with stronglifts (keep getting stronger but fatter)

2) Focus on hiit + weights (reduce fat but lose muscle + strength)

3) Focus on hypertrophy (maintain strength and fat but build muscle)

4) something else? Please provide reasoning.

Thanks for any input or feedback!"
