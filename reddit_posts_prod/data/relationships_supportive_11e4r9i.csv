I'm not being supportive and I need help,SmoothZoo500,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11e4r9i/im_not_being_supportive_and_i_need_help/,5,1,"(TLDR: my partner is having a tough time and I'm struggling with how to help and stopping some BS self centred behaviours)

My [M27] partner [M22] is having a tough stressful time with work, family drama, a potential mental health diagnosis next week and most of all, me. So needless to say I've been rubbish at being there for him.

He has a cardinal rule I respect and understand which is if he has to tell me how he needs me to help him, then it feels like he's just helping himself.

But nothing I do is ever the right thing for the circumstance. Asking to listen or just listening, asking to talk, happy distractions, physical touch, etc. all are the wrong things when I try them. I've become fearful to try anything so he needs to prompt me.
I resort to reading articles like how to be a good partner, I ask my therapist for help but get nowhere.

I'd just love suggestions on any of 3 things: alternatives to what I'm doing to try to help or when I'm doing them, how to better 'read the room', or how to stop emotional triggers like the crippling fearfulness to get it wrong (because it leads to giving up)

Thanks."
