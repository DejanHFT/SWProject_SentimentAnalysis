Looking for inspiration for some upcoming holidays and hoping to hear about your activity-based trips that involve learning a skill or conquering a feat together such as surfing or sailing camps, multi-day hikes or mountain biking adventures.

Bonus points if its a setup where you join solo or with one friend and join a group of people you don't know yet to all learn the skill / accomplish the feat together.

Some examples that come to mind:

\- Sailing courses (usually group of 4-6 and for about a week)  
\- Ski camps  
\- Guided multi-day hikes such as the lost city trek in Colombia  
\- Scuba diving classes  
\- Surfing/kite surfing schools  
\- Yoga/meditation retreats

Any experiences, recommendations or maybe even lesser known ideas would be great!   
Anything where you learn or accomplish something together with people you ideally did not know yet before."
