Are two 1/4 sheets of acrylic better for soundproofing or one 1/2 thick sheet?,TITANIUM94010,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/11uf31s/are_two_14_sheets_of_acrylic_better_for/,11,6,"I'm building a soundproof (at least as soundproof as practical) CNC enclosure. For the front, I am planning to have a set of 12x12 windows mounted on 3/4 mdf doors. Would it be better to use two 1/4 thick acrylic sheets with an air gap in between or a solid 1/2 or even 3/4 sheet? Using 1/4 and 1/2 sheets would cost around the same, 3/4 a good amount more at $68 in total instead of 44 for 1/4 and 1/2. If a 3/4 sheet is noticeably better I'd be willing to spend the extra cost, but I'm not sure.

From what I could find online, the general answer seems to be that two sheets are better than one, but none of them specify if they mean an extra sheet of the same thickness material or two sheets that are half as thick. 

I'm also planning to use a thin 1/8 sheet on the back to act as a replaceable shield for chips put out by the CNC, but it's only going to be loosely mounted without sealant. Thanks!"
