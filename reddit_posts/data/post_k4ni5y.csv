With the new protein fold predicting AI in the news; are there 2 proteins with identical amino acid sequences but different structures that have fundamentally different enzymatic activity or function in the cell?,arkaryote,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/k4ni5y/with_the_new_protein_fold_predicting_ai_in_the/,38,461,"With the news of the new DeepMind AI that can accurately predict the 3D-structure of a protein; this got me pondering about environmental factors that influence protein structure (e.g: Salinity, pH, Temperature, etc). 

Are there examples of proteins with identical amino acid sequences but have a different 3D-structure and therefore the protein acts entirely differently? i.e: A protein in x-conformation acts as a Kinase in one environment but in y-conformation in another environment it acts as a carboxylase. Are these a result of specialized chaperonins?

I don't necessarily mean a protein that exists in both forms in the same organism, but also 2 different organisms and 2 different functions. Any examples would be amazing.

Edit: Thank you everyone for all your thoughtful and scientific responses."
