My inspiration sponge got squeezed,Ducklickerbilly,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/zo963s/my_inspiration_sponge_got_squeezed/,9,7,"I wrote a book series about witches and faeries and dark magic bc that’s the kinda stuff I was interested in . 

But it’s weird now bc when I look back at all the art work and stories that inspired me they don’t excite me anymore. Writing the series has emptied me of the joy those things once held 

So now I’m trying to figure out what to make next and nothing seems that cool. I thought I’d do a sci fi or space opera but idk. Do I even like space ? It’s just ok. 

Any advice from the community on if this happens to you and what you do?"
