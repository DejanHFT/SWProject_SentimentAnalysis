Possibly a dumb question but we'll see,TCcommanderAlex,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/dmt4op/possibly_a_dumb_question_but_well_see/,25,10,"So hey! For reference I'm 19m 6'1"" 230lbs I'm not in terrible shape but I think I'm making good progress towards my goals 

Weight goal: 224 (realistically) 200 (doubt I'll get there anytime soon but that's my ultimate goal)
Weight lifting/agility goals, Kentucky State Police physical requirements 

I'm not super close to these markers but I am closing in on them and that has me wondering. What do I do when I reach my goals? The obvious answer is do better, do more reps, get even stronger but honestly I dont want to be super ripped and all that. 

So I guess my question is, to those of you who have gone out and achieved your goals and decided to not make more, how do you maintain your form? Cause obviously if you dont work on it it will go back to flab and unhealthy lifestyles. 

Do you slack off a little bit in the gym now that you arent trying to improve? Maybe even though you know you could do more reps, you choose to stop? That seems very foreign and weird to me so I was hoping for insight into what you do after you achieve all of your goals

Edit: so basically what I'm seeing here is that there is no maintaining a certain level of fitness, you are either progressing to the next level or losing progress. 
I know I'm not going to get ""suddenly ripped"" I just have no aspirations of ever getting to that level of fitness. 
I imagine fitness as a huge building with no elevator, and for my life I need to be on floor 5. There are higher floors and i could stand to be on floor 6 but really floor 5 is already optimal and over and above what I need in my life. 

Side note:those are arbitrary numbers that I made up on the fly"
