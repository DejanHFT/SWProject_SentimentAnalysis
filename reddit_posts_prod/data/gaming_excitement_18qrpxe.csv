I miss the excitement video games used to give me as a kid,Verothyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/18qrpxe/i_miss_the_excitement_video_games_used_to_give_me/,247,821,"The kind of excitement that fueled me to stay up all night to play, and be completely unaffected the next day. I miss being able to get off work/school, boot up a game and just playing until I was forced off due to an event or eventual sleep deprivation. If I try that now, I’m struggling to keep my eyes open past midnight. 

I miss single player games that made you think in different ways to solve a puzzle, or the satisfaction of figuring out a difficult encounter on your own. Or when you could brag about it to your friends and the only way they’d find out about an encounter in the game, was if they played it.

Now I feel like my time is limited as an adult, and solving a puzzle is more of a hassle than it’s worth the reward, so googling it to save time is almost always the answer after feeble attempts.


Im in my thirties and I know that the phrase “getting old sucks” isn’t something any of us like to admit, but damn man. Getting old really does suck."
