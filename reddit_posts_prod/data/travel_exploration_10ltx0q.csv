Traveling with Wife - is it weird to take some days where we explore city on our own and meet up later,SgtSlice,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/10ltx0q/traveling_with_wife_is_it_weird_to_take_some_days/,466,1488,"Hi,

My wife and I are traveling to Barcelona and Valencia later this year. We were talking and proposed taking a day or two in each city where we both explore the city however we please and meet up later.

It really comes down to that we have different things we are interested in. While walking down the street, she may spend an hour looking at various shops that I may have no interest in and Iâ€™m ready to move on.

I tend to move a bit faster through the city, and might want to see various historical military encampments or people watch. 

Surprisingly we both agreed that this would be good. Is this weird? Our relationship is fine, we just explore at different speeds and have some different interests."
