"AskScience AMA Series: Testing Your Poop to Support Public Health: We Are Wastewater Surveillance Experts, Ask Us Anything!",AskScienceModerator,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/r5lruj/askscience_ama_series_testing_your_poop_to/,186,1117,"Let's talk wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE)!

WBE uses wastewater (aka, sewage) sampling to track public health at a population level with geographic specificity. While it has been around for decades, wastewater surveillance really entered primetime as a [tool for tracking the spread of COVID-19](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/9/21-0753_article#r6). By detecting cases before symptoms emerge, wastewater surveillance can act as an [early warning system for outbreaks](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestwater.1c00050) and even [variant detection](https://www.bio-rad.com/featured/en/wastewater-variant-surveillance-for-sars-cov-2.html), helping local organizations and governments keep ahead of the curve.

In the U.S., the CDC and HHS created the [National Wastewater Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/surveillance/wastewater-surveillance/wastewater-surveillance.html) (NWSS) to monitor community spread. Similar efforts have cropped up around the world including the Sewage Analysis CORe group Europe ([SCORE](https://score-cost.eu/)) and the Global Water Pathogen Project ([GWPP](https://www.waterpathogens.org/)). Many of the resulting studies can be visualized using the [COVID-19 WBE Publication Map](https://www.covid19wbec.org/publication-map).

At this point, you may be wondering: How on earth can scientists detect trace amounts of a virus in municipal wastewater? The average American uses [approx. 82 gallons](https://www.epa.gov/watersense/statistics-and-facts) of water at home every day! Despite this volume, tools like Droplet Digital PCR allows scientists to detect [one infected individual in 10,000](https://www.bio-rad.com/featured/en/wastewater-surveillance-for-sars-cov-2.html), as many as six days before they would test positive via a nasal swab.

There are so many more techniques, programs, and applications (incl. tracking other infectious diseases, drug use, etc.) possible with WBE. We can speak to topics such as:

+ The history of wastewater testing and how wastewater surveillance works
+ How wastewater surveillance has helped track COVID-19 outbreaks
+ The technology that makes it possible, [including ddPCR](https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/feature/wastewater-surveillance-for-sars-cov-2.html)
+ The overall research landscape surrounding WBE and its future applications
+ Other general questions about WBE challenges, science policy, infrastructure, overall execution, and beyond

Feel free to start sharing your questions below. We'll be answering them live today (11/30) starting at 5:00 p.m. EDT (2 p.m. PDT, 22 UT).

A bit more background on us:

+ **[Colleen Naughton, Ph.D.](https://engineering.ucmerced.edu/content/colleen-naughton) - Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California Merced** (u/COVIDPoops19)
    + Dr. Naughton's lab designs sustainable and culturally sensitive Food-Energy-Water Systems for and with the Underserved (FEW-US) locally, nationally, and globally. She co-leads the [COVIDPoops19 dashboard](https://ucmerced.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/c778145ea5bb4daeb58d31afee389082), which aggregates COVID-19 WBE efforts from 270 Universities, 3,075 sites, and 58 countries. As part of this project, she manages the [@CovidPoops19](https://twitter.com/COVIDPoops19) Twitter handle. Dr. Naughton is also a part of a global data center for wastewater and COVID-19, [W-SPHERE](https://sphere.waterpathogens.org/). She completed her Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the University of South Florida, spent 10+ years working in Africa (North and West), and is a former [AAAS Science Policy Fellow](https://www.aaas.org/programs/science-technology-policy-fellowships).
+ **[Mats Leifels, Ph.D.](https://www.scelse.sg/People/Detail/f40ef98b-3c2f-4f10-9d11-82d28e209436) - Research Fellow at the Singapore Centre for Life Science Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore** (u/M1r0lin0)
    + An expert in infectious disease detection in water sources, wastewater, and the aquatic environment, Dr. Leifels helped implement and coordinate the wastewater monitoring program as part of Singapore's National SARS-CoV-2 strategy. He has published extensively on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment, but also works with a broad range of enteric pathogens, from dengue to Zika virus, using methods such as quantitative PCR. Dr. Leifels is an assoc. editor for Elsevier's [International Journal for Hygiene and Environmental Health](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-hygiene-and-environmental-health).
+ **[Leo Heijnen](https://www.kwrwater.nl/en/experts-expertises/experts/leo-heijnen/) -  Molecular Microbiologist at the KWR Water Research Institute** (u/Leo_Heijnen)
    + A leading voice in the application of molecular methods for health-related microbial water quality, Leo Heijnen has spent over two decades working on water quality at KWR--a non-profit research institution that brings new scientific knowledge to the water sector. He was a pioneer in the development and implementation of molecular and DNA-based technology for monitoring the urban water cycle, which has since become routine practice in many regions. Prior to KWR, Leo worked as a research scientist at the KeyGene N.V., an AgBiotech company, and as a molecular virology research technician at both Leiden University and Utrecht University.
+ **Tara Ellison, Ph.D. - Senior Field Application Scientist at [Bio-Rad Laboratories](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bio-rad/)** (u/BioRad_Laboratories - Tara)
    + Dr. Ellison is a field application scientist with over 20 years of experience in molecular biology and transcriptional regulation in the fields of metabolism, cancer, and biomarker detection. She trains researchers on quantitative and Droplet Digital PCR technologies and assists them with developing robust methodologies for nucleic acid quantification. Dr. Ellison has a Ph.D. in Pharmacology from Case Western Reserve University and was formerly a postdoctoral fellow at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.
+ **David Eaves - Field Application Scientist, Regional Manager, at [Bio-Rad Laboratories](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bio-rad/)** (u/BioRad_Laboratories - David)
    + David Eaves is an expert in molecular techniques (particularly quantitative PCR, ddPCR, and next-generation sequencing), supported by over 15 years of hands-on molecular biology experience, working in both research and clinical environments. He has translated this experience to support researchers as a field application scientist, technical sales specialist, and now as manager of a team of genomics and proteomics application scientists for Bio-Rad Laboratories. Prior to this, Eaves spent 8 years at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, serving as a senior molecular pathology technician and research assistant."
