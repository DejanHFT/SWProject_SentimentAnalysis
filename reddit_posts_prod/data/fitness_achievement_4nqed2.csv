Advice on Achieving Goal!,Whitegrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4nqed2/advice_on_achieving_goal/,5,0,"###Hi r/fitness!

Firstly, this subreddit is a great resource and it has already help me get a long way towards my goal.

###Stats and history
25 y/o, Male, 6ft, 80kg, on Stronglifts 5x5 (use the app)

Started lifting last year but gave up once I hurt my back when squatting with bad form (healed now). Started again about one month ago.

###Goal and program
Overall goal is mostly hypertrophy but also strength (I would like to climb Mont Blanc one day!). As I am a beginner - I decided it would be best to get strong first and then increase the volume later.
Hence my current aim of achieving the proficient level on the site https://symmetricstrength.com (level of strength standard), which is for an 80 kg male is:

Exersice|Current x 5 reps|Goal x 10 reps
:--|:--|:--
Back Squat|85kg|110kg
Deadlift|115kg|130kg
Bench Press|60kg|80kg
Penlay Row|60kg|70kg
OH Press|37.5kg|55kg
Chin Up|+2.5kg|+10kg

To get there I am doing SL 5x5 program and once I achieve the given weight goal I will increase the reps for x5 to x10 (decreasing the sets to x3 if needs be)

###Rest and nutrition and form

Aim to eat a surplus of 3200 kcal (160g protein) per day and track this on myfitnesspal app - I am still trying to meet this everyday.

I'm also trying to get 8 hours of sleep a night - but for most days it is about 6.5 h.

I have had my form checked by a personal trainer a couple of times

###Progress and question

View my progress chart here! https://symmetricstrength.com/lifter/danieloconnell

As you can see I have been making good progress but it is **starting to stall and I am wondering why?**

I have been very eager to see progress and have been increasing the weight by 5kg for some of the lifts instead of the prescribe 2.5 kg. Also, I have started to do Bench press and OH press on both A & B workouts, instead of one each.

Any pointers or advice to help me continue making progress would be fantastic!"
