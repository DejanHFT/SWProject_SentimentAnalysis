Business vs Engineering Degree for Entrepreneurship,No_Map3944,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/16r4ws6/business_vs_engineering_degree_for/,7,3,"I’m interested in becoming an Entrepreneur and starting my own business in the future, but I’m not sure which degree to pursue in college.

My problem is I have no idea what kind of business to start. I feel like an Engineering degree would help with problem-solving skills and ability to innovate. And people say Business degrees are useless. 

For the past couple years I had been planning to pursue a Business degree but the more I hear about Industrial Engineering the more interesting in it I become. I love math and I love to think, so I feel like I would do well in it.

The only problem is I did not take Physics, Chemistry, or Calculus & Vectors in high school. So I’d have to do those in my current gap year.

Is it worth the trouble to go into Industrial Engineering or should I stick with pursuing a Bcomm degree, maybe with a major in finance.

Any input would be appreciated.
Thanks."
