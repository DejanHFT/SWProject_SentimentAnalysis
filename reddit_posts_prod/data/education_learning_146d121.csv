Predictive Popcorn: An Innovative Strategy for Active Learning,Dramatic_Macaroon416,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/146d121/predictive_popcorn_an_innovative_strategy_for/,5,7,"Hi guys, I’ve been delving into the concept of predictive processing and finding ways to incorporate it into the classroom. One idea that emerged from this exploration is called ""predictive popcorn,"" drawing parallels with popcorn reading. This strategy encourages students to collaboratively construct and refine definitions for new concepts, initiating from their existing understanding and gradually developing it through cycles of prediction, discussion, revision, and integration. The approach not only aids in comprehending the topic at hand but also fosters critical thinking and the acceptance of making and learning from mistakes.

Take, for instance, introducing fractions to your students. You could kick-start with something fundamental like ""A fraction is…"" and then allow students to predict and add the subsequent words. The initial definition may be whimsical or even make little sense, but it provides a foundation for everyone. It helps identify pre-existing ideas or misconceptions about fractions that can be later clarified during the lesson.

As the lesson progresses, you can revisit this initial definition, refining and expanding it as students gather more knowledge about fractions. This cyclic process of prediction, discussion, revision, and integration not only assists in better understanding the subject at hand  but also renders the entire learning process more engaging and memorable. 

Here's a step by step example:

1. Introduction and Concept Definition (Embracing Mistakes):Initiate by introducing the new topic or concept to the class. Start a group definition; incorporating an error or nonsensical aspect is perfectly fine and helps make students comfortable with the idea of making mistakes.

2. Predictive Popcorn Round 1 (Iterative Learning & Connecting with Prior Knowledge):Using a round-robin format, each student contributes to the definition or explanation, building a cumulative group understanding. Encourage each student to predict and add to the definition based on their current understanding. Prompt them to link this new information with what they already know.

3. Group Discussion (Integrating Feedback, Metacognitive Awareness & Structured Peer Feedback):After the group has created a full definition, take a pause for group discussion. This discussion should facilitate students in evaluating the accuracy of the group definition, identifying errors, and refining understanding based on peer feedback. Guide them with structured feedback prompts such as ""What do you agree with in the definition?"", ""What do you think needs revision?"", and ""What would you add or remove?"". Urge them to reflect on their thought process - how they arrived at their contributions and their reactions upon learning they were right or wrong. During the group discussion phase, you also can divide the class into smaller groups or pairs. 

4. Individual Revision (Iterative Learning, Metacognitive Awareness & Connecting with Prior Knowledge):Now, allow students to individually revise the group definition, incorporating the feedback from the group discussion. Instruct them to reflect on their learning process, comparing their understanding at the start of the lesson to their current comprehension.

5. Teacher-Led Instruction (Attentional Balance):The teacher then provides a comprehensive explanation of the topic, giving the correct definition and a detailed explanation. Students contrast this new information with their individual revised definitions, observing the differences and updating their understanding.

6. Predictive Popcorn Round 2 (Iterative Learning, Repetition & Connecting with Prior Knowledge):Following the teacher’s instruction, start a second round of Predictive Popcorn. This time, students apply their updated knowledge from the teacher’s instruction and their personal revision to predict and contribute to a new group definition. During the group discussion phase, you can divide the class into smaller groups or pairs.

7. Final Comparison and Discussion (Integrating Feedback, Metacognitive Awareness & Structured Peer Feedback): Conclude the lesson by comparing the group definitions, individual definitions, and the teacher’s definition. Engage in a discussion about the evolution of understanding from the start to the end of the lesson.

Here are some of the benefits of using this method in your classroom:

It promotes active learning.
Students are actively involved in the learning process, rather than passively listening to a lecture. This helps them to better understand the material and to retain it longer.

It encourages critical thinking.Students are forced to think about the material and to make predictions about what they will learn. This helps them to develop their critical thinking skills.

It fosters a collaborative learning environment.Students work together to create and refine the definitions, which helps them to learn from each other and to build relationships with their classmates.

It's fun!Students enjoy the challenge of predicting the next word in the definition and of working together to create a complete definition. This makes learning more enjoyable and more likely to stick.

Here are some additional tips for using the predictive popcorn activity in your classroom:

Start with a simple concept.When you're first introducing the activity, it's helpful to start with a simple concept that students are already familiar with. This will help them to understand the process and to get comfortable with making predictions.
Be flexible.The predictive popcorn activity can be adapted to fit the needs of your classroom and the level of your students. For example, you can adjust the amount of time students have to make predictions, the size of the groups, or the number of rounds you play.
Encourage discussion.After each round of the activity, take some time to discuss the students' predictions. This will help them to clarify their understanding of the concept and to learn from each other.
Celebrate successes.When students make good predictions, be sure to celebrate their successes. This will help to motivate them to continue participating in the activity.
 
In general I think it’s a good way to learn concepts and at the same time is a good way to learn meta cognitive learning skills. Also it encourages a growth mindset, a belief that students’ abilities and understanding can develop and improve through effort and perseverance

Does anyone have any suggestions, questions or ways to refine it?"
