Any literary commentary on The Diamond Age?,treereenee,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/yg60ft/any_literary_commentary_on_the_diamond_age/,36,65,"I am on yet another reading of my favorite book, The Diamond Age (or, a Young Ladyâ€™s Illustrated Primer) by Neal Stephenson. 

I have read this book probably dozens of times over the years, and I always gain a deeper appreciation for it each time. I wonder if anyone is aware of any well-written literary commentary on this particular book? Or maybe wants to start some here? 

I had this thought while reading the scene in which Nell finds the Constable playing bagpipes over the cine feed of a land war in China. Is there any parallel to real life events referred to in this book? Or is Stephenson just that good of a world-builder? 

Are there any descriptions of the research he may have done? Or interviews you may have particularly enjoyed?"
