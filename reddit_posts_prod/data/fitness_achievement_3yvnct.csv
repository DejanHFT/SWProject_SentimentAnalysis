What is yours biggest achievement in 2015?,voluk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3yvnct/what_is_yours_biggest_achievement_in_2015/,185,27,"The year of 2015 is coming to an end. 

What was your biggest achievement this year? Have you reached your goals you have set in 2015?

I started lifting in June 2015 and I have changed my lifestyle completely. I have learned a lot from here, got great inspiration from amazing ppl at fitit. Right I'm in gym every morning, six days a week doing P/P/L and grinding hard for those gains. I will never go back to the lazy and unhealthy lifestyle I had before. 

Edit: Thank you all for shared stories and achievements! Someone will find inspiration in them, others - motivation. 

Happy New Year everyone! Keep it up and never look back! "
