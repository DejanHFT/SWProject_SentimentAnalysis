Which is the most powerful scream in cinema history?,Thrusthamster,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/74uakh/which_is_the_most_powerful_scream_in_cinema/,434,508,"I've always liked when actors can pull of a good emotionally distraught scream. Other than dialogue it can feel more primal and genuine when done correctly.

I think maybe my 2 favorites are (SPOILERS SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE AND GODFATHER 3):

[Superman screams when he finds Lois dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxF3kNmJ7tk)

[Michael Corleone screams when he finally lost everything after years of struggle (never mind Sophia Coppola, Al Pacino acted the shit out of that scene)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyaDlIirJnw)

EDIT:

Can't skip Mr. Jackman:

[Wolverine hears Stryker's plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDchmwdIsI8)
