If i already have a jigsaw and a straight edge do i need a circular saw to cut plywood? (beginner DIYer),dsetarno,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/12htfhp/if_i_already_have_a_jigsaw_and_a_straight_edge_do/,350,712,"Hi all,

I need to cut up some bits of marine plywood no more than 15mm thick that will form the base of a bed for my van. I need to mould the bed into the curves of the van so will need a jigsaw in any case but I've read online that I'd also need a circular saw too.... If I have a good straight edge and clamps, couldn't I achieve a clean straight line already? What extra benefit does the circular saw give me? I'm looking to save 70 euros on a tool I won't use much.. 

Thanks for your help"
