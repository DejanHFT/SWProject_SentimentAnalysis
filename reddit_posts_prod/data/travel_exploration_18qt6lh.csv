3.5 days exploring central Portugal or visiting Madrid?,vy2005,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18qt6lh/35_days_exploring_central_portugal_or_visiting/,9,2,"I have a 2 week trip to Portugal planned in early April, flying into Lisbon and flying out of Porto and plan to explore both cities a good bit. I have a 3.5 day gap in my itinerary that I am trying to decide how to fill. I am choosing to either work my way up Portugal - some combo of Nazare, Coimbra, Tomar, and Fatima, or taking a short flight to visit Madrid for the first time.

For some context about me, I am a man in my early 20s, I will be traveling alone, hoping to stay in social hostels. I enjoy big cities but also beautiful nature. I am honestly not that much of a museum person but I love learning more about the local culture via guided tours. I am open to suggestions - from my reading it seems like Portugal has a robust train network to use and the towns will be fun to explore, especially as it is the off season and things will be slower paced. But I also would enjoy going to Spain and participating in some of the nightlife. Which would you all recommend? Thanks!"
