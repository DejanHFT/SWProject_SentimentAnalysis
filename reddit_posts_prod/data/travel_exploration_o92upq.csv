Prepping to explore Europe in Summer 2022,ThatOneDudeWithAName,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/o92upq/prepping_to_explore_europe_in_summer_2022/,31,3,"Hello everyone, im new here and need some advice. I’ve got $6000 (maybe a bit more if i can make some money during the school year) that Im going to use to travel around Europe for 2-3 weeks next summer. Right now my goal is to visit Helsinki, Finland and the surrounding area for a week and then fly down to Romania for 2 days, see Draculas castle and then continue on to Greece and see Athens and explore some of the Greek coast.  I would love to see Italy, but I dont think thats doable on this trip. Is $6000 enough to see a fair amount of what I just listed? I know traveling by plane can get expensive so is there cheaper alternatives to getting from one area to the next? Whats some general good advice for someone new to traveling? Travel tips and tricks appreciated. Thanks!!

It should be noted I’m 25m and will be going alone."
