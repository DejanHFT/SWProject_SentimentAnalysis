My biggest frustration with Adobe Creative Cloud,deathcastle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/2eppxl/my_biggest_frustration_with_adobe_creative_cloud/,31,2,"I am an interaction designer, and VERY amateur photographer, and my biggest issue to date with Adobe Creative Cloud is the way they have crafted their subscription packages. The options are;

* Photographers package (PS, LR) **£8.78** per month *(on sale for £7.49)*
* Single app (any ONE app + extras) **£17.58** per month
* Complete (all apps + extras) **£46.88** per month

The Photographer package would be perfect for me! and I think that it's amazing value, but for my job, I sometimes need to use After Effects *(very rarely)* and Illustrator *(again, very rarely)* and the addition of typekit would be incredibly useful. To get this, I would need to choose either Illustrator, OR After effects, and pay an extra £17.58 per month for the privilege of using the software on an incredibly occasional basis, or be a total chump and pay for the Complete package at £46.88 and have a load of apps available to me that I will NEVER use.

My solution to this is to pirate both Illustrator, and After Effects and have them aside just in case I do need to use them. I would MUCH prefer to pay for legitimate copies, but the price of doing that is ridiculous since Adobe has decided to set their packages up in a very 'cable TV' manner.

If Adobe were to maybe offer single apps for something like £6 a month for a minimum of 3 apps as a package, I would pay for their products in a heartbeat.. Instead, I am pirating a few of their products.

I have not researched Typekit enough to know whether it's available as a standalone item.. I'll do this now.

Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Agree? Disagree? I'd love to know what you think.."
