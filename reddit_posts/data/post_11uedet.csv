Can the direction of a parent/child relationship be determined from two DNA samples?,DrOmega2468,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/11uedet/can_the_direction_of_a_parentchild_relationship/,6,10,"I was listening to a podcast where they discussed finding ancient remains and DNA samples of a father/daughter pair. I was wondering, from DNA alone, is it possible to distinguish between a father/daughter vs a mother/son pair?

To my mind, one sample has half the genes of the other, But that alone wouldn't be able to determine which is the parent and which is the child, right? Maybe they had other clues to make that call? (like one was still a child?)"
