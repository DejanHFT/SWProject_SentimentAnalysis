People who achieved some of their fitness goals: what was your goal and how long did it take?,morris1022,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2oyudb/people_who_achieved_some_of_their_fitness_goals/,147,51,"Been doing SL about 2 months(ish) and my goal is to lose some weight (started at 168lbs, already down to 162), eat more healthy (check), feel more healthy (double check), increase strength (kind of getting there), increase arm/chest size (starting to ""tone up,"" but not where i want to be), and decrease BF% from ~17% to get visible abs (still not quite there).

Anyway, the purpose of this post is to try and get a gauge of how quickly people achieved various goals so us noobs who have similar goals can get a realistic timeline based on the efforts/successes of others. Please post what program are you on, what are your fitness goals, and how long Did it treasure to achieve how much of it? BONUS FOR PROGRESS PICS

Obviously everyone is different so what took someone 3 months might take someone else 2 or 4, but at least we'd have a general idea. 

TL:DR what program are you on, what are your fitness goals, and how long Did it treasure to achieve how much of it? BONUS FOR PROGRESS PICS"
