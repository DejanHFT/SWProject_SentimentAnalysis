Cambodia interpid vs G Adventures,Grapefruit4001,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/170vsps/cambodia_interpid_vs_g_adventures/,4,1,"I know everyone compares these two companies. 

Looking at doing Cambodia with one of these. My plan is to do Vietnam solo (return trip) then start join a group tour to Cambodia. 
I'd be looking at the classic or original tours I'm 40 I'm okay with staying in dorms, but I'm not into partying."
