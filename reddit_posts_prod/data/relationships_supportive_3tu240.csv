I'm [20F] having sexual thoughts about a supportive friend[21M],throwwaway682,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3tu240/im_20f_having_sexual_thoughts_about_a_supportive/,15,32,"So my dog passed away yesterday and my friend has recently lost his dog too so he came over last night to make sure I was okay. 
We ended up falling asleep watching a movie and I slept in his arms all night, this morning I woke up and accidentaly brushed my hand over his erection and to be honest it got me excited and made my mind wander.

**tl;dr** Friend stayed the night to comfort me, woke up with an erection. does that mean he wants to sleep with me? I've always thought he was cute but I see him as more of a brother...now I'm having sexual thoughts about him. 

Help?"
