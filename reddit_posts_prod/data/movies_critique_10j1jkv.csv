"What films were brave achievements that put the filmmakers at risk? Films that defied powerful governments, corporations, individuals or even societies? Films whose critiques endangered the filmmakers?",nagato188,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/10j1jkv/what_films_were_brave_achievements_that_put_the/,20,1,"Can you think of any films that were brave attempts by filmmakers to address issues that could or did lead to their arrest or persecution or some form of threats? Ironically, *The Interview* is one of the few examples I could think of, but even then, it was made by highly regarded American stars who were threatened by a government they had no direct relationship with (as opposed to, say, being North Koreans who might have had families back in North Korea). *Citizen Kane* is perhaps a better example, in how its content resulted in the magnate William Randolph Hearst attempting all sorts of harmful shenanigans in his pursuit of revenge on Orson Welles.

But the strongest example I could think of off the top of my head is probably [*Z*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_(1969_film)) (1969), a masterpiece by [Costa-Gavras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa-Gavras).

""The film presents a thinly-fictionalized account of the events surrounding the assassination of the democratic [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece) politician [Grigoris Lambrakis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigoris_Lambrakis) in 1963. With its dark view of [Greek politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_politics) and its downbeat ending, the film captures the director's outrage about the [junta that then ruled Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_military_junta_of_1967%E2%80%9374).""

""[Jonathan Richards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Richards_(author)) wrote in 2009, ""It's hard to overstate the impact that this Oscar-winning procedural thriller had in 1969, on a world roiling in political activism, repression, and discord. In the U.S., the Vietnam War was on the front burner, the populace was passionately engaged, and the police riots outside the '68 Chicago Democratic Convention and the murder of Black Panther [Fred Hampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hampton) were raw wounds. With this stylish, intense indictment of the assassination of a leftist political leader by a right wing government cabal in his native Greece, director Costa-Gavras struck a nerve that resonated here and around the globe.""""

Are there any other films that openly and bravely defied a government, corporation, significant person or society, to the potential or real risk of those involved in its making? I know a lot of films are daring and challenge norms, but which films put the livelihoods of those involved at risk?"
