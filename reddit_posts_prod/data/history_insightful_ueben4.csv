King’s Accommodations During Travel in Middle Ages?,Pen_and_Think_,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/ueben4/kings_accommodations_during_travel_in_middle_ages/,64,268,"When a king or noble was traveling long distances over multiple days/weeks/months, what were there sleeping arrangements like? 

This is when they could not find lodging at another noble’s estate; I’m seeking to visualize their “on-the-road” accommodations.

How did they camp down? Did they use tents that they kept to themselves? Were there beds (if so, how were they transferred?) What about heating — did they use braziers or fire pits inside a tent? What about smoke? 

If somebody more knowledgeable could paint a picture for me, i just want to understand how it worked back then. 

Any answers related to any stage of the medieval periods across continents are appreciated; information more specific to the late 12th/early 13th century Europe are even more helpful! 

Thank you!

EDIT: Thank you all who have taken the time to help me thus far!
