"Intrepid, G adventures and other adventure companies",bambambud,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/x86ep6/intrepid_g_adventures_and_other_adventure/,66,18,"I recently did a trip through intrepid in Alaska. I was not impressed with what they did for the trip or the guide.

Are some of these companies better than others? Are they mostly the same? It seems like they resell the trips to local guides and it’s kind of a crap shoot. Wonder what others have experienced. 

I don’t want to travel entirely solo so the group piece has appeal for me."
