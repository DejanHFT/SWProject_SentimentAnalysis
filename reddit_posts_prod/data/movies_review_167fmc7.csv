As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.

> Divided into chapters marked by gorgeous interstitials that feature Bella in imaginative surrealist vignettes, *Poor Things* is an insanely enjoyable fairy tale that creates not just one, but multiple distinctive worlds — each of them a beguiling artwork — peopled by memorable characters fleshed out by a first-rate cast. Wildly flamboyant yet directed with unerring control, it’s also a story rich in contemporary currency, about a woman rebuilding herself from scratch, strictly according to her own rules, which provides Stone with the role of a lifetime. Or two, in Bella’s case.

> Oddly moving in its fervor and abundance, “Poor Things” may appear a far cry from the harsh, stripped ascetism of an early work like “Dogtooth.” But they’re actually similar animals, fixated on taking people apart to find what makes them tick, what makes them swoon, what makes them interesting.

-[Guy Lodge, Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/festivals/poor-things-review-emma-stone-1235710477/)

> “Poor Things” is the best film of Lanthimos’ career and already feels like an instant classic, mordantly funny, whimsical and wacky, unprecious and unpretentious, filled with so much to adore that to try and parse it all here feels like a pitiful response to the film’s ambitions.

> This film comes to us from an elite group of talent, including cinematographer Robbie Ryan and production designer Shona Heath, with an insinuatingly strange musical score by Jerskin Fendrix. Everything in it – every frame, every image, every joke, every performance – gets a gasp of excitement.

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/sep/01/poor-things-review-yorgos-lanthimos-emma-stone): 5/5

> This triumphant adaptation, which premiered last night at Venice, strip-mines Gray’s book for all its funniest, fizziest and sexiest ideas, and leaves the chewier, more literary stuff on paper, where it belongs. I’d say purists might bridle, but speaking as one of them, I wasn’t just relieved, but overjoyed. 

-[Robbie Collin, The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/poor-things-review-emma-stone-yorgos-lanthimos/): 5/5

> Peel back the layers of creature feature make-up and look beyond the gaudy, Gaudí-in-a-fishbowl sets, try to dim the swirling burlesque of guts and gore and pleasures of the flesh and you’ll find a rather classic – and classically appealing – Victorian coming-of-age tale at the center of Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Poor Things.”

-[Ben Croll, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/poor-things-review-emma-stone-yorgos-lanthimos/)

> It will be intriguing to see whether Poor Things becomes an Oscar contender. It may prove too subversive and oddball for more mainstream tastes, but it’s an exquisitely made film. As for Stone? She gives a wildly inventive star turn.

-[Geoffrey McNab, The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/poor-things-review-venice-emma-stone-b2403396.html): 4/5

> Most of the films by the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos couldn’t exactly be called sentimental. Not the grim shock of Dogtooth, certainly not the family murder drama The Killing of a Sacred Deer, not even the sci-fi romance (of a sort) The Lobster. It’s a surprise, then, that Lanthimos’s new film Poor Things, which premiered here at the Venice Film Festival on Friday, takes a long, strange trip toward something like sweetness. 

-[Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/09/emma-stone-poor-things-review)

> Boasting Lanthimos’ off-kilter trademarks (fish-eye lensing, unconventional framing, switches from rich black-and-white to saturated colour), Poor Things is a riot. McNamara’s (The Favourite, Cruella) screenplay is littered with laughs and quotable dialogue. Jerskin Fendrix’s score is rife with queasy distortion while Holly Waddington’s non-conformist costumes are gorgeously weird and surgical (Bella wears a cape that’s practically prophylactic, her puffed sleeves recalling internal organs).
