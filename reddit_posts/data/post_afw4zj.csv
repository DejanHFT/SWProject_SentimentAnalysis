How is ground penetrating radar reshaping our view on the true size and scope of ancient civilizations?,BlazesAndAmuzed,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/afw4zj/how_is_ground_penetrating_radar_reshaping_our/,0,5,"I've seen studies on the cities of the Maya being mapped out recently with ground penetrating radar, and have also head account of chambers, underground tunnels, and complex structures being discovered in places like Egypt, Gobekli Tepe and others. How is this technology reshaping how we view these civilizations?

In cases like the Maya, we've literally revealed thousands of previously unknown structures. Is there work being done to get this information out to the public, or create much more detailed maps and recreations of ancient cities around the world (eg. Sumerians, Babylon, Giza, Memphis, Indus Valley, Greece, etc..).

In addition to this, how likely is the possibility that in the next few years (with the advances in virtual reality and AI technology) we can start to get fully immersive experiences of historically accurate recreations of ancient cities?"
