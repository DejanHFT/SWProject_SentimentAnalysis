"Creativity, Trends, and Ownership",PlausibleCoconut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/i3axbw/creativity_trends_and_ownership/,0,1,"This is a discussion I haven’t seen here, but I haven’t been here long so sorry if this has been addressed times before. 

There seems to be some posts that posit a brand/company “stealing” a design or text from a smaller creator. Yet it often seems like these objections are concerning a trending topic or a  combination of words that are common in the lexicon. 

How do you communicate that the design/combination of words aren’t necessarily copied, but more likely a coincidence? How do you tell someone it isn’t likely they were copied but the idea was trendy/easily reproducible? Tough love?"
