How to increase Learning / Knowledge bandwidth? (How much you can learn at once),MaltoonYezi,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/wagtom/how_to_increase_learning_knowledge_bandwidth_how/,7,0,"Imagine a situation, when a student studies a lot (May be for an exam or for skill building). That student has free time and is willing to study all day long, with maximum efficiency, over a certain period.

Perhaps, that student would want to incorporate learning as a constant habit...

However, it is also widely denoted that ""cramming for exams"" does not work, and that taking too much information at once can be overwhelming, causing **Information overload.** Hence, it is not efficient to take much of the information at a moment, and a lot of it could be forgotten shortly after learning. That is why some are in favor of ""spread out learning"".

There probably might be some kind of a limit or a balance of how much information could be taken over a certain period for an individual. It would indicate how much information it is the best to take, let's say in a day.

Perhaps a student would like to increase that limit/balance, so that more information could be taken with the same learning effect/efficiency that could be achieved with smaller amounts of information previously.

It is important to note that this kind of increase, should not be created at the expense of learning rigor and attentiveness

May be, a student could go through a set amount of material in a day, and later, consistently increase the material amount taken in a day?"
