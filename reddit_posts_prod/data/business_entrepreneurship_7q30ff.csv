College Majors that Translate Well Into Entrepreneurship AND a Career (X-Post r/Entrepreneur),TheSnydaMan,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/7q30ff/college_majors_that_translate_well_into/,0,1,"Hi! I'm going back to school and Ive narrowed things down to a few majors I think I'd enjoy doing making reasonably good wages.

The big BUT is that I don't want to do a 9-5 for the rest of my life. I am getting this degree to get a job that can fund my future entrepreneurial endeavors and I want my education to, in some meaningful way, help in both areas. The degrees I'm interested in are as follows:

Electrical Engineering
(Creative application of mathematics)

Urban Planning
(I'm near Detroit which is doing tons of rebuilding and zoning so job availability should be a bit higher than some other areas)

Finance
(I love managing money and dealing with numbers)

Supply Chain Management
(Love / have a knack for this side of the small business I've already started)

Of the listed interests, I think it's readily apparent that Supply Chain Management and or Finance would be the two top contenders, but I still would appreciate some outside insight, as well as suggestions for degrees that might be similar to these I might have missed.

Thanks so much for your time everyone!"
