Creating an alien ecosystem thread : Andolemme,draum_bok,https://www.reddit.com/r/nature/comments/4ueec7/creating_an_alien_ecosystem_thread_andolemme/,0,2,"Idea for a topic : someone posts a description of an environment on a planet, and one or two of the native species. The following response describes another one or two life forms, which are in some way connected to the previous organisms or the habitat ; predator, prey, symbiotic or a parasite, or has a relationship with the environment, etc. Reply to any comment you choose but keep the other species in the thread and environment in mind as well...still it's just an idea so take it whatever direction you'd like! At the end we'll see what kind of ecosystem evolves.


To start I’ll describe the planet and two of the native species :

**Andolemme** is a serene seeming world 80 light years from Earth. It has two suns, several moons, and a reddish-gold sky. Multi-coloured fields of diverse grasses and sparse forests thrive, less is known about the bodies of water or regions the Fangor do not inhabit.


**Fangor deer** are a native species of four-legged centaurians with a vaguely humanoid torso and slender arms. They have two large almond-shaped eyes facing forward and two eyestalks that can see in all directions. They have powerful tails with sharp blades on the end used for defence against many dangerous predators. They inhabit the rolling fields, and like primitive human tribes possess only the most basic tools. The Fangor deer use tail and body signals to communicate, and have fur/skin which can change slightly in colour and texture.


**Gara trees** are very old, large organisms resembling trees dotted across the fields and forests of Andolemme that possess a strange limited ‘telepathic’ ability giving them a subtle way to communicate with the Fangor deer. It is unclear why or how they do this. When Gara trees reach a certain age, large spheres called Gara fruit or 'apricorns' can fall off them and roll across the fields. It is said the spheres may vary drastically in colour, appearance, and chemical composition."
