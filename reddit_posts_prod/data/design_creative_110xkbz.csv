AI is disrupting creative industry and media is sending the wrong message.,Architect_LA,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/110xkbz/ai_is_disrupting_creative_industry_and_media_is/,138,79,"Not long ago, the artists were protesting against AI, because the AI can generate images so fast that they flooded the art platform where artists display their work \[[video](https://youtu.be/ssi2EWdjY00)\]. Recently, chatGPT is like another bomb in the creative industry, it can write poem, lyrics and stories. Together with other music and audio generative AI… Boom, you get a video just like that.

The media is emphasizing how FAST the AI is. I’m sure you’ve seen these: “make video in minutes”, “Earn thousands per day by AI generated stuff”. Paired with the same shocking face. And yet very few of them care to talk about QUALITY. This confuses me because in creative industry, we usually celebrate how SLOW the creative process is. James Cameron’s team spend 10 years on the Avatar movie, people have high expectations to it because subconsciously we all agree that quality related to the amount of time we’re invested in. Of course, the more advanced tool can increase productivity. But there’s a fundamental difference between the capability of an individual tool and the quality of the product made with the tool. For example, everyone knows how to use scissors and comb, the tools do exactly the things they supposed to do, but how many of you have met a bad hairdresser before?"
