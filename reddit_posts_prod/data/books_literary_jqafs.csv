"Reddit, which films do you think measure up to their literary sources? ",busybrowsing,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jqafs/reddit_which_films_do_you_think_measure_up_to/,209,75,"I recently finished reading American Psycho and saw the film adaptation last night. I felt that as entertaining as the movie was, it really came up short in capturing the satiric vibe of the book. So I ask you, can a movie ever measure up to the depth of a novel?

Besides LOTR, of course. :)"
