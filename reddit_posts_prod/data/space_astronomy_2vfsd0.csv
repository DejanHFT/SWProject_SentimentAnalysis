[Here's my full bio.](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~sasselov/vita/cv06.txt )

I teach Astronomy at Harvard, run Harvard's [Origins of Life Initiative](http://origins.harvard.edu/), and search for alien life as a co-investigator on [NASA's Kepler mission](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/main/) focusing on the composition of exoplanets as clues to the emergence of life. My free online course [Super-Earths and Life](https://www.edx.org/course/super-earths-life-harvardx-spu30x) starts today, and will discuss in-depth how I and my team search for alien life.

Edit: I have to hop offline for a bit, but will return this evening to answer some more questions. This has been great so far!

Edit: Hi everyone - I am back.
