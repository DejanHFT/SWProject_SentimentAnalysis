How Much Inspiration Is Too Much?,ClassicBuster,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/wwy5vd/how_much_inspiration_is_too_much/,11,1,"So I've been making an rpg with my girlfriend for the past few years, no I'm not advertising, and there's quite a few story concepts I really want to use. The issue is some of them take heavy inspiration from things I like (like the villain taking over the main hub town) and I'm not sure where I should draw the line. I'm not trying to make some incredibly deep and subversive masterpiece, but I also don't want to carbon copy other things either.

Also I'm not super well versed in what things are common or not so my example may be super common for all I know. Honestly just want some input on it."
