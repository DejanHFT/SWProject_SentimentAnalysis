Amazon Prime Day Deal: Buy $75 of select care items (incl. nutrition and wellness products: ON Whey Protein Powder) Receive $25 Amazon Gift Card,asb822,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3ddb7i/amazon_prime_day_deal_buy_75_of_select_care_items/,275,1001,"Title is pretty self-explanatory. Today is Amazon Prime Day in celebration of Amazon's 20th Anniversary, and one of the deals is that if you purchase $75 in Health & Personal Care Products then you can get another $25 to Amazon. I saw that the ON 100% Whey Gold Standard is eligible to be used towards the $75, and I've seen from my time lurking on this thread that you guys speak highly of that specific powder, so I thought I'd post it here. Note that you need a Prime membership to take advantage, but I've heard it works with the 30-day free trial (that you can cancel after today.)

You'll have to supplement the 5-pound bag with some protein bars or fish oil or whatever else you guys use (or something from one of the other available categories, like diapers, healthcare products, household products, or personal care appliances) but if you use Prime it could save you some money. For me it does not appear that the same deal applies to the 10-pound bag (which would break the $75 threshold) but user [tbends](http://www.reddit.com/u/tbends) was able to [call and get $25 taken off the 10 pound bag](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3dd5gd/amazon_prime_day_deal_10_lb_on_whey_for_86/).

Deal appears to be going all day, but I'd imagine the deal is subject to availability. My apologies if there's a better sub to post this to!"
