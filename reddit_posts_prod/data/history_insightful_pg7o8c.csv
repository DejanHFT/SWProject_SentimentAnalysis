What are the worst battlefields in history?,MMAGG83,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/pg7o8c/what_are_the_worst_battlefields_in_history/,570,1883,"I'm talking about battlefield conditions, not the number of casualties. 

I went on a memoir reading spree from soldiers who fought in the world wars. I often found that some of the worst conditions people fought in weren't always the deadliest battles. An example I can share as a template for posts is the Battle of Peleliu  

Peleliu was a coral island with no potable water. The opening day of the battle reached temperatures of 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 C). The ground was hard coral, which made digging foxholes and trenches all but impossible. It also splintered when shot or blown up, creating extra shrapnel. Almost all vegetation on the island was knocked down from the prelanding naval bombardment, which meant most cover on the island was small mounds of debris or craters. Those shot in the open seldom stood a chance of reaching cover, and were often killed by the enemy as they begged their comrades for help. Because of how open the battlefield was and how fluid the lines were, dead were unable to be moved  or buried safely. The corpses of men killed on the first day would often times remain in place for the duration of the battle, slowly decomposing. These bodies were often men the soldiers knew, who had to sit and watch their friends' remains decompose in the tropic sun for weeks. Next came the fact that no latrines could be dug, meaning bodily waste was often times placed in empty ration cans then thrown as far from the soldiers as they could manage. The battle was expected to take two weeks. It dragged on for 76 days in unbearable conditions. 76 whole days of vicious fighting with limited cover, extreme heat, a severe water shortage, completely surrounded by bodies and human waste baking in the sun. Veterans who were on Guadalcanal, New Britain, Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa as well as Peleliu would almost unanimously say that Peleliu was by far the most hellish Pacific Island battlefield. 

What are some other lesser known battlefields that were pure hell for the soldiers who fought there?
