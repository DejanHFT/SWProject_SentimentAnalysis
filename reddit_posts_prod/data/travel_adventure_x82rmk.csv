Looking for an adventurous travel book,hippikon,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/x82rmk/looking_for_an_adventurous_travel_book/,6,1,"Hello, I'm 22yo from Europe and later in my life I'm planning to travel to some adventurous places in South America, Africa, etc. Ideally I would love to find a book written by someone who traveled to such places (or others) a lot and shares his/her adventures and insights from these travels in an interesting way. It could be a travelogue or even a ""practical tips and tricks"" kind of book. I appreciate all recommendations, even if only remotely similar."
