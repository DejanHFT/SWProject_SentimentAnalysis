Should I be doing cardio as a skinny person trying to achieve an athletic build?,LittleTyrone69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/dkfuw0/should_i_be_doing_cardio_as_a_skinny_person/,31,35,"So I returned to the gym after a long break ðŸ˜…. Iâ€™m pretty skinny but pretty strong for my weight class. Iâ€™m 5â€™9 and 132 lbs (18 years old). My goal is to put on muscle but achieving more of a boxerâ€™s physique ( lean, low body fat, ripped, etc). Since Iâ€™m pretty skinny, I want to put on some muscle, but should I be doing cardio to achieve my goal, or not doing cardio so I can put on some weight?

I got my body fat percentage checked last year and it was 8% if that matters. The end goal is an athletic build, I do not want to put on any fat! I want a fighterâ€™s physique such as Mcgregor, Mayweather, etc.

Any advice or tips is appreciated. Thanks!"
