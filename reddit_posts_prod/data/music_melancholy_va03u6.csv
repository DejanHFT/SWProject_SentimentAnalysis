I wrote lyrics for my upcomming but still predominantly imaginary song. I decided to call it mellogsim (melancholy + syllogism). It's still a work in progress.

Twisting your insides just to drive you insane
Abysmal crater illusively real
And it reels you in, like a godless executioner
Roaming in a sea of thoughts, discriminating not even one
Their carcasses violated thrown into the same pit"
