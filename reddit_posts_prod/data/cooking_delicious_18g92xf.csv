"Your MOST elite, delicious, to die for pan sauce to go with roast chicken??",pfemme2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/18g92xf/your_most_elite_delicious_to_die_for_pan_sauce_to/,70,74,"I’ve been teaching my bff to cook, and this week we’re finally at the pinnacle: roast chicken! We’re also going to do sweet potatoes, yams, or Japanese yams (whatever looks best/least expensive at the store lol) and sautéed lemon garlic spinach (she has learned the spinach recipe before and we’re going to do a simple bake recipe for the sweet potatoes, w/ kerrygold & brown sugar to finish), so it’ll be a nice meal.  

My roast chicken always comes out lovely and juicy, but a pan sauce never goes awry. However, I have only one pan sauce in my repertoire. I mean, I can mix it up with some different seasonings, sure, but the base of chicken broth, butter, garlic, white wine, that’s literally the only one I know how to do.  

Do you have a beloved pan sauce you pair w/ very juicy, savory roast chicken? If so, please share your recipe here. Thank you!!!!"
