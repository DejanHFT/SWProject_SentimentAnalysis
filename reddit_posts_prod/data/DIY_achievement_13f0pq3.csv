How in the heck do people get to the required R-value for their roof insulation?,OGWiseman,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/13f0pq3/how_in_the_heck_do_people_get_to_the_required/,81,29,"I am looking to insulate the roof of a shed that I'm building this summer. My plan is to use 2x6 rafters on a lean-to style roof. With 1"" of that space taken up by the baffles, that leaves me 5"" of space to put insulation.

I live in the Pacific NW, where the recommended R-value for a roof is 38-60.

The best insulation I can find is foam board, which has an R-value of 5 per inch. With 5"" of space, that means a max R-Value of 25, and that's with zero margin for error, and the difficulty of getting multiple large pieces of foam board secured up in each rafter opening. And I'm still not close to the recommended value!

The only insulation products I'm seeing that achieve that kind of R-value are 9.5"" thick is not thicker. That would mean using 2x12s for my roof, which would be super expensive, super heavy, and just not what I want to do if possible.

I've thought about furring out the bottom of the rafters with 2x2 or even 2x4 material, but that STILL wouldn't get me all the way to R38, and seems like it would be a huge pain, might not support the drywall, etc.

Am I missing something here? How are people hitting this R-value number for smaller projects? Or are most people just undershooting the R-value but it doesn't matter that much?

Any tips or tricks for insulating roofs would be much appreciated, because I'm stymied. I've got the walls and the floor sorted out, but lots of research on this particular aspect has left me stymied.

Thanks!

EDIT: This ""shed"" is going to be an exterior office for my wife, which is why I'm insulating it. Sorry for the confusion in the OP!"
