Why Google reviews for movies are full of fake reviews and why google is not removing or flagging these reviews?,chevair,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18tnq0x/why_google_reviews_for_movies_are_full_of_fake/,166,334,"I was Googling the "" **Leave the World Behind** "" movie title to see whether it's worth watching and the audience reviews score is just horrible =1.9 stars. I went along and opened the reviews and thousands of them are copied and pasted with ONE STAR rating. I wonder how many great or good titles I've missed just because of this bs

**Google it for yourself to see what I mean.** 

Is it a sort of marketing move? bot attack? I don't get it.

Can someone explain what is going on? 

And it's not only movies I'm talking about..restaurants and some professionals get the same thing.

Please don't post spoilers :) I still want to watch this movie. "
