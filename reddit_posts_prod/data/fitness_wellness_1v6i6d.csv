What goes well with Chicken?,Madone2607,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1v6i6d/what_goes_well_with_chicken/,18,4,"I am now starting to diet properly, for the past few days I have been buying cooked chicken thighs from Tesco, I just need something to go with the chicken?

What could be a good addition to my diet that's available from the Tesco store?

Keep in mind I will be buying this on my break during college so I don't have access to cook etc."
