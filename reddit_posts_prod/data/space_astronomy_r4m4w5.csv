"Being able to follow advances in astronomy, cosmology, & astrophysics has been a godsend in these times. The enthusiasm is contagious.",mjmcaulay,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/r4m4w5/being_able_to_follow_advances_in_astronomy/,21,49,"I know there is a lot of work to be done regarding things like global warming and other existential threats, but sometimes I need that boost of enthusiasm. I’ve loved science generally, and space related fields more specifically, for the majority of my life. In a time where a lot of documentaries are focusing on the grim reality of global warming,  which I do agree is necessary, it’s good to hear the enthusiasm about the future and the research being done today to get us there.  “How the Universe Works” is fairly flashy but the exuberance of the scientists they interview has been like cold water to my parched soul. 


I have no idea who will see this, but I will give my sincere thanks to all those involved. And, really, that extends to all scientists working hard to get it right."
