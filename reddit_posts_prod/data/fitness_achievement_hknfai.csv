Is any kind of form achievable in a month?,An_Apple_Juice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/hknfai/is_any_kind_of_form_achievable_in_a_month/,121,120,"Noob question here

I will be doing some hiking with backpack in mountains at the start of August. I am lazy piece of crap that sits at office all day long not doing any sports for few years and ofc I am overweight. But I was starting to like just skipping rope when I have some free time. Does skipping rope about 30-60 mins a day will achiev me any improve in stamina/cardio? (I cant run , I am out of breath after 100 meters and my legs are killing me)
