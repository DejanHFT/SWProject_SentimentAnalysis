Queensland Rail Explorer Pass,AndreasGreen,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1961o1w/queensland_rail_explorer_pass/,0,2,I am planning a trip to Australia and I have looked at the different kind of travel passes. Does anyone here have experience with the Queensland Rail Explorer Pass. Is it worth it? Is the stops close enough to the popular destinations? Is it better than a buss pass? I much prefer traveling with rail rather than bus.
