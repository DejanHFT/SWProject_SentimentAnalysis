Achieving good composition as a long distance runner.,slayer03144,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/94qe1c/achieving_good_composition_as_a_long_distance/,3,2,"I am 19 y/o male who runs about 6 times a week(40-50 miles per week) and I lift 2 times a week.

It is a full body routine with heavy weights, mostly compound movements.My protein intake is about 120-150 grams per day and I am 178 cm,63.5 kg's and about 11.5-13.5% Bf( wide range sorry).

I  am not too strong but I have a decent figure(bulked when first went to gym)  and I am not skinny fat.

I would appreciate some advice on how could I ( and if it's possible) reduce my Bf to ~9-10%( no need for lots of muscle).Any tips related to lifting, eating and lifestyle.

I know some of the elite runners are really skinny and others have decent body with 6-7% Bf, and abs.And also some lift bodyweight and  some lift hard.

Thanks!!!"
