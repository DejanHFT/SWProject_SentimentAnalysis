I'm a single mom(34f) and my new boyfriend(35m) is on methadone and now depressed- how can I be supportive?,namastewithmydog,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14w0wue/im_a_single_mom34f_and_my_new_boyfriend35m_is_on/,9,0,"TL;DR: My new boyfriend whom I've known for a long time is trying to come off methadone but found out his grandfather now has cancer after moving in with me. How can I be more supportive of his recovery and depression? I understand addiction, and I understand depression, but I don't know how to comfort him? 

**What did you do when your partner was going through this, or what did you not what your partner to do?**

My friend(35m) of nine years and I(34f) started a relationship. I'm a single mom of a three-year-old (but trusting him around her is not an issue) and realize I already have a lot on my plate - as I have for the last three years - but we were/are excited to start our relationship. We are ambitious about working on changing the direction of life together. So there was a lot of positivity the first two weeks he arrived...

Then about a little less than a week ago (the third week he moved in), he got the news that his grandfather has cancer (unsure of what kind, but it's terminal). His dog is still in the other state and I know he misses her so much :( 

I knew he was on methadone and not in a good place so he moved across state lines to live in a more sober environment. I want to be clear that I do not mind driving to the clinic or holistically helping him. I've given him daily massages, (try to) cook healthy, herbal teas and smoothies, and just be next to him in general so he doesn't feel so alone. 

I understand addiction, but I know methadone/coming off of heroin is different than other drugs. I'm trying not to be too overbearing, and he says he wants me next to him but we haven't had sex in a two (going on three) days. I guess what I'm saying is there are parts of this new relationship I love and that is one of them for sure (for god sake I tried five times in the last two days). I'm scared he's going to leave, either from me or my daughter, and go back to a place he will surely...not be good in.

Can someone shed some insight? Have any single mothers/ or mothers gone through a partner with a methadone addiction and now depression?
