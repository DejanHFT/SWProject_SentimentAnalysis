Some critics argue that melody has become less important in the current pop landscape, while others claim that it is still a crucial element that drives commercial success.

In this thesis, I want to explore the role of melody in modern pop music and how it contributes to the commercial success of popular songs. To do this, I will analyze a selection of popular pop songs from the past decade and examine the melodies that are used in these songs. I will also look at how these melodies are used to create catchy hooks and memorable melodies that are likely to stick in the listener's head.

Through this analysis, I hope to shed some light on the importance of melody in modern pop music and how it contributes to the commercial success of popular songs. I also hope to spark some interesting discussions about the role of melody in pop music and how it has evolved over time.

What do you think? Is melody still an important element in modern pop music, or has it become less important in recent years? I'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on this topic."
