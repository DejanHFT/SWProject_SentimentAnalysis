Sudden lack of motivation.,Azntigerlion,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3rjnvq/sudden_lack_of_motivation/,23,6,"So for the past 9 months I have been religious about the gym.  Every day that I could go to the gym, I did.  Every day that I could not, I was pretty salty about not being able to go.  I haven't missed a day in the last 2 months. And I LOVE my time at the gym.  I enjoy being there and just lifting.  

Suddenly, yesterday, I was halfway through doing abs and I just lost motivation.  I got pretty tired early for some reason.  I could have pushed through and finish, but I just didn't.  I just stopped and thought ""Oh well, I did my full tricep workout, so I'm done"".  

Today.

I'm typing this right now when I should be at the gym.  About 5 mins ago, I just decided to skip today.  

What keeps you guys motivated?  I don't know why I'm unmotivated.  I hope by next week I'm running at 100% again.  "
