At which size do particles start casting shadows instead of behaving according to the Fraunhofer diffraction?,Crotaro,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/b626gh/at_which_size_do_particles_start_casting_shadows/,4,19,"This post/comment has been edited in protest against Reddit's upcoming changes to the API.

One way Reddit could still make lots of money, even if nobody ever created another post or comment, is by selling the existing data (conversations in threads, etc.) to AI language model companies. Editing all my comments/posts using PowerDeleteSuite is my attempt to make the execution of this financial plan a bit more difficult."
