need help with achieving visible abbs,wheresmuhabbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/24zfm2/need_help_with_achieving_visible_abbs/,32,0,"I know this question is on the cover of every single mens magazine; but i wanted to ask you guys because i know you will give me unadulterated and realistic answers.

I have done everything ive read about achieving abs and maybe there is something im missing. I am a 30 year old male, my average weight is 160 at 6'1, but even at my leanest (148) i never had abs.  Ive spent the last 3 years working out regularly/ 4-5 times a week and eating all whole food diet, no refined carbs, no alcohol and staying lean on a low carb diet.

I talked to a trainer last year, he did some bmi calculations, measurements, mathematics and broscience- and told me i was 8.95% body fat. He said that i need to work abs MORE so that they show better.

I have been hitting the gym harder than ever, introducing more carbohydrates to my diet- building a bit more muscle for sure and working the abs HARD these last 2 months. I have noticed that the more i work my ab muscles, the more i'm getting this protruding gut. If i suck it in and flex it looks normal, but regularly its starting to appear to look like a beer belly. A friend of mine said i need to do abdominal vacuum exercises, because working your core too much makes your abs protrude. 

I thought ide ask here what you guys think before i continue down this path. I used to be a chubster my whole life and made a change in my life 4 years ago. I am really happy with who i am, my nutritional and physical success- but i would just like to see the kind of results one would assume you get from being as active as i am. 

Please go ahead and be as abrasive as you want, i am open for suggestions.
