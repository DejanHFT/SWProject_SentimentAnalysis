Do you ever feel very emotional connections to historical figures or places?,genuinemermaid,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/28flg6/do_you_ever_feel_very_emotional_connections_to/,210,226,"So, I've been this way for as long as I can remember, but I always just thought that maybe it was a really weird side effect of being a nerd. I don't think it's anything big and spectacular, but now I'm just wondering if any other history lovers do it.

There are a lot of people and places I tend to get a bit emotional about, or am perhaps overly-fond of, but for the sake of clarity I will focus on one realm in this post. Let's talk France: I am utterly enamored with the Palace of Versailles, but I think most people are. I mean, it's obviously a very beautiful place, and a lot of people gush over it, so that kind of explains that portion of it, I suppose. And I tend to attribute that explanation to every place that I'm ""in love with"": it's probably just that they're so beautiful and I can't be there at all times, so it's kind of bittersweet, in a way. My thing with the Palace of Versailles is not only its aesthetics, but also (surprise, surprise) its rich history. Though I've never been (I'm only seventeen and my parents have no interest in travelling to Europe), I imagine that if I were to walk the grounds, all I would be able to think about was the sheer... *presence* of all of its previous inhabitants. I mean, nothing supernatural, or anything -- just the knowledge of who roamed the corridors and gardens would be lingering in the air for me. I know that I intend to visit someday, and whenever I imagine the visit, I think of myself being overcome with emotion and probably crying.

But when it comes to the people from history...I don't really know. I guess the best people to talk about would be the Revolution-era royal family. Marie-Antoinette and Louis XVI are tragic figures, so it only makes sense that many people are attracted to them and get sort of emotional about their stories. But I am also oddly attracted to their daughter, Marie-Therese Charlotte, about whom I think people talk much, much less.

Whenever I feel myself being drawn to a historical figure, the admiration/interest comes very suddenly. The only thing that all of my objects of interest really have in common is that they are of the female gender.

In retrospect, this post was weird, ramble-y, and hard to understand, and I probably sound like a weirdo, but again, just wondering if anyone felt the same about literally anything history-related.

**Tl;dr: I probably get as emotional about history as most people do about their close friends and family.**"
