How can I (42m) be a more supportive partner for her (35f)?,Appalachianfairytale,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nujhv1/how_can_i_42m_be_a_more_supportive_partner_for/,20,1,"How can I be supportive to my upset partner?

Tl:dr legitimate life circumstances affect her moods and I don’t know how to help 

My partner(35f) and I (42m) are slowly reconnecting/rekindling after a few months broken up. We’ve been together off and on for almost three years. it’s my fault we broke up but I’m in therapy and on medication among other things to address the issues. I’m trying. 

Her work/home situation is tough due to geography/work from home/kids done with school. Multiple days in the past few weeks as soon as we begin texting in the mornings she has expressed anger or sadness at “everything.” Sometimes she makes it a point to exclude me from the everything but not always. 

I don’t know what to do. She’s often not interested in solutions she just wants to be heard and have her feelings validated. I’m very willing to do that of course. I’m just as willing to try to find solutions and if I can’t find solutions, find whatever ways I can to mitigate the background noise in her life to help her manage the things we can’t fix right now. I’ve asked her a time or two if she just wants to be left alone and sometimes she won’t even respond. 

I love this woman. She is the love of my life. I’m not angry. I’m not blaming her. I don’t think she’s doing any of this out of malice or narcissism. It’s just how she expresses her emotions. I don’t feel like we’re at a secure enough point where I can…express this directly when her mood improves. I also don’t really have friends to talk about this stuff as I’m pretty isolated myself. I’m just looking for any kind of suggestions to try and be the best most supportive partner I can be when her mood is bad and I feel helpless. It’s about her, more than anything, about helping her. That alone will mitigate my concerns. She’s too amazing to not be the best i can be for her. Please help!"
