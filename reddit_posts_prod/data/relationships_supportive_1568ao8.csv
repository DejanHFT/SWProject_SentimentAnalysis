Men supporting SO financially,Noosh3201,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1568ao8/men_supporting_so_financially/,8,0,"I (41M) met a woman (36F) on one of my international business trips and we fell in love. Dating for 8 months now. We planned to get married and to bring her to the USA. A lot of her friends are models and have foreign boyfriends that spoil them.

Fast forward a few months and finances became an issue. She was living with her parents in a luxury house with 4 dogs. Her parents left the country and went back home. She didn't want to leave the county to go with them because of the dogs. So now someone has to pay the rent, utilities, helper, etc. Her work visa got cancelled so she is only staying as a tourist. 

She needs approximately $3,000/month for these expenses. Additionally there are other expenses but she is putting those all on her credit cards and paying the minimum. 

I do make good money. $3,000 is approximately the amount of money I save every month outside my 401K. I also have lots of savings and investments. I made the mistake of telling her this. She was raised to enjoy the moment. She doesn't understand the concept of saving. That's why her family cannot help her.

I paid her one month (3K) while I figured out if I want to continue doing this. Well... that one month I also paid to fly there which was $4,000. She asked for perfume at the airport, 3 of them. I bought one. We went to the mall and she wanted to buy a lot of stuff and I didn't offer. She wanted to take a luxury trip in the country to an island and I said no. I didn't take her to nice restaurants.

She argued with me that the romance is dying. I explained that me paying her $3,000/month expenses is romantic. She said I am wrong and that is my duty as a man to take care of his woman. 

I said in America that's not how it works. She said BS and that she has had American boyfriends that have sent her money before and paid for trips for her and her friends. As a man I should be able to take care of her.

I don't think it is the job of a man to pay for a woman. Yet I see many men doing it... do they end up happy at the end? I don't think so.... maybe I am wrong.

I can't do it. I can help my partner if they need help but this is a lifetime of support this woman is asking. I like my luxury lifestyle. I cannot have a luxury lifestyle supporting someone.

I ended the relationship. It hurts ...I just wanted to vent. I guess I am picking money over love. 

TL; DR: Girlfriend (36F) is saying it is my job as a man (41M) to support her financially. We have been dating for 8 months. I just can't do it. The relationship has to end"
