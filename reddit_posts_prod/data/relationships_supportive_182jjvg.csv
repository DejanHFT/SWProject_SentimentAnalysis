"I, girlfriend(18) and boyfriend(21) are going through a rough patch in our relationship. Advice on how to be a supportive girlfriend?",agirlfromaplace_,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/182jjvg/i_girlfriend18_and_boyfriend21_are_going_through/,5,4,"My boyfriend and I got together earlier this month and when I tell you everything was picture perfect. Everything. Was picture perfect. 
We’re long distance but we made time for each other, I bought a plane ticket to see him for his birthday in March, and we were just bonding a lot. However, recently we hit a rough patch. 

After he put his dog down, his entire demeanor changed for the worst. We haven’t talked in three days and I know he’s not being shady because he hasn’t been active on social media either. He’s been isolating and been getting aggressive with customers at his job, he says he’s been isolating because “he doesn’t wanna snap and be really mean to me.” But he is in desperate need of counseling.

I know better than to suggest that idea to him right now because I know he’d snap and it would cause a fight but this “work” he’s doing on himself clearly isn’t working because it’s driving him away from me. I just want my boyfriend to be happy, but he’s only making himself worse.

Im trying to be a good girlfriend right now, but I don’t know what to do. Advice?

TL;DR: Boyfriend has been very distant and cold since his dog died. He’s been isolating and been aggressive with customers and I think he needs therapy but he’d snap on me if I said something. Advice?"
