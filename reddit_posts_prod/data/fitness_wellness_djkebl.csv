Is Pea Protein and Egg White powder just as effective as Whey? I don't react well to whey for some reason.,Borange81,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/djkebl/is_pea_protein_and_egg_white_powder_just_as/,50,13,"The only type of whey protein I can actually stomach without a bad reaction is the Whey Isolate UNFLAVORED with zero additives. basically plain chalky flavorless whey. I just blend it with fruits like a smoothie and drink it post workout. Id like to add some in to get my protein intake up without having to stuff myself and feel bloated. 

I was thinking of trying some Pea  or egg white Protein powder to mix in my daily fruit and veggie smoothie, Im trying to limit my dairy intake. I want to see how my body reacts to less Dairy.

I was looking at Vitacost and I usually get a coupon there Any good recommendations on brands of Pea Protein or Egg White protein? good quality for a low price."
