Now I am finally able to.

+ Some people will probably think that I look like an idiot,because I'm still too skinny,but I don't care. It feels great to be able to wear it.
+ It is also really motivating to gain in certain areas (shoulders,chest) and lose in the gut area,to look better in it.


Some info: 

+ I'm 6' 150lbs. Been working out for 2 years on and off. Recently started taking it much more seriously. 
+ Diet is still hit and miss,but I generally try to follow the leangains plan.
+ Regarding workout routine; I tried SS for a bit,but found it extremely boring and not stimulating enough for the upper body. So I did [WS4SB](http://www.defrancostraining.com/articles/38-articles/65-westside-for-skinny-bastards-part3.html) for around half a year,and 3 weeks ago switched to [PHAT](http://www.simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html).
