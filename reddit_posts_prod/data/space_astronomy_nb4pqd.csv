Anyone else excited for the next few years of Astronomy?,GarunixReborn,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/nb4pqd/anyone_else_excited_for_the_next_few_years_of/,28,97,"I feel like the next few years are going to be huge advancements in the field of astronomy. We have several next-gen telescopes coming to life soon, on earth and in space, we're gonna send people back to the moon, we're gonna have a fully reusable rocket, and we've just unlocked the ability to fly on other planets. We also have a rover on mars looking for life, and plans to make a permanent base on the moon, as well as a space station around it.

Also JWST is **FINALLY** getting ready to launch"
