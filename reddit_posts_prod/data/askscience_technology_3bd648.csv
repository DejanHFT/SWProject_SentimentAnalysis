Iron smelting requires extremely high temperatures for an extended period before you get any results; how was it discovered?,TheBananaKing,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3bd648/iron_smelting_requires_extremely_high/,710,3792,"I was watching a documentary last night on traditional African iron smelting from scratch; it required days of effort and carefully-prepared materials to barely refine a small lump of iron. 

This doesn't seem like a process that could be stumbled upon by accident; would even small amounts of ore melt outside of a furnace environment?

If not, then what were the precursor technologies that would require the development of a fire hot enough, where chunks of magnetite would happen to be present?

ETA: Wow, this blew up. [Here's the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuCnZClWwpQ), for the curious."
