What I misunderstood about exercise when I was fat,maester_ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4e6435/what_i_misunderstood_about_exercise_when_i_was_fat/,446,2718,"I know there's a lot of new people here who are just getting started with exercise, and I wrote something that might be useful. It's what I misunderstood about exercise when I was fat. The article is rather long, and I don't want to just dump a link on /r/fitness and leave, so I'll summarize it below:

**TL;DR:** I used to believe exercise is something that exists primarily for weight management--a sort of drudgerous, self-flagellation that you just have to endure for your health and wellness. I tried multiple times to ""work out"" and lose the eighty pounds that I gained beginning in college, but I always stopped. It wasn't until years later that I realized I'd had it all wrong. Cycling taught me that exercise can be fun. *Joyful*. A form of play, as the late Dr. George Sheehan often said. I've since come to feel similarly about running; it's a form of liberation, and it's an essential part of my life.
