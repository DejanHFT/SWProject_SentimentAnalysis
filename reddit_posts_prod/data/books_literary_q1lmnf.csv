I suck at literary analysis,wonderfulworld25,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q1lmnf/i_suck_at_literary_analysis/,27,73,"I wish I was better at literary analysis when it comes to breaking down a novel or piece of fiction. 

I enjoy reading very much, but when asked to analyze literature, I’m not confident in doing such. No matter how hard I try to think about the meaning behind the words, I fear that my interpretation isn’t as compelling or as interesting. It’s as if I don’t have any meaningful observations to contribute. Everyone else has come up with the good ones. 

How does one improve on literary analysis?"
