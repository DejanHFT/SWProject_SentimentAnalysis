What's Your Experience with the Undergraduate Philosophy Major?,Kylaran,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/z2i26/whats_your_experience_with_the_undergraduate/,107,46,"Hi everyone.

It's been a scant 7 years since the first appearance of this (http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2007/nov/20/choosingadegree.highereducation) Guardian article pointing out the success of philosophy majors in the business world, yet one recent piece of news I read is already reporting statistics showing that philosophy continues to be known as an unemployable major (http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-04-22/college-grads-jobless/54473426/1). From it I quote:

>College graduates who majored in zoology, anthropology, philosophy, art history and humanities were among the least likely to find jobs appropriate to their education level; those with nursing, teaching, accounting or computer science degrees were among the most likely.

University philosophy departments frequently advertise the worldly skills you gain from a philosophy major, yet this somehow also seems to be at ends with the idea that philosophy is a contemplative endeavor for self-fulfillment. Where on the spectrum do you think an education in this field lies: towards practicality or towards the less useful?

What are your experiences? What are your thoughts? Were you thinking about choosing the major? Did you do it? If not, why? Does the degree even matter? 

[Edit] I apologize I linked to a wrong article just now. I've corrected the first link from The New York Times to the Guardian."
