Have you ever been inspired by your dreams and nightmares when writing your stories?,Daviddv1202,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18w4zdv/have_you_ever_been_inspired_by_your_dreams_and/,30,44,Has anyone here got inspiration from writing their books from their dreams and nightmares? I've been having weird dreams lately and they're slowly starting to form together into a story. I haven't wrote my first novel yet (Mainly due to my war against cliche tropes) but I have a feeling I might be on the right track. But how about you guys? Has this ever happened to any of you? 😁
