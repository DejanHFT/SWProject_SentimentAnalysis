**Sample Reviews:**

While it can’t eclipse what came before... McQuarrie delivers a formidable concept and several hall-of-fame set-pieces while somehow also managing to tie the storylines back into these movies’ core mythology. - Peter Debruge, Variety

The strong cast, high-gloss production values and constant wow factor of the action offer plenty of distraction from the storytelling deficiencies. - David Rooney, Hollywood Reporter

This is a serious, sharp-minded and top-tier action film by any standard, and many fans will no doubt mollify themselves by seeing it more than once before Part Two opens a year from now. This is Hollywood action filmmaking at its peak. - Todd McCarthy, Deadline Hollywood Daily

If you choose to accept to this “Mission” – and what action-movie fan or Cruise nerd wouldn’t, really – it’s the first half of a man vs. machine epic that doesn’t skimp in the thrills department. **3/4** \- Brian Truitt, USA Today

I reckon “Dead Reckoning” is one of the best movies of our so-far lacking summer. **3.5/4** \- Johnny Oleksinski, New York Post

This outrageously enjoyable spectacle has compelled my awestruck assent with its sheer stamina, scale and brio. **5/5** \- Peter Bradshaw, Guardian

The film is a mirror image of its star – a muscular, extravagant, thoroughly old-school work of ingenuity and craft. **4/5** \- Clarisse Loughrey, Independent (UK)

Dead Reckoning never rises to that best-in-series movie’s level, though McQuarrie concocts set pieces and the cast carves out stand-alone moments that stick with you past the credit roll. - David Fear, Rolling Stone

This one’s an endlessly thrilling, continuously propulsive beast, tense from the start: even the quieter, conversational scenes have you on edge. Mission, once again, accomplished. **4/5** \- Alex Godfrey, Empire Magazine

Brimming with confidence and swaggering showmanship, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One further cements this series as a consistently dazzling action franchise. - Tim Grierson, Screen International

""Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One"" isn’t quite as dynamic as McQuarrie’s preceding ""Fallout,"" but it’s not far off that standout’s pace, and it finds a way to concoct a satisfying resolution to its tale even as it sets up its closing chapter. - Nick Schager, The Daily Beast

Dead Reckoning Part One may not be the best movie in the Mission: Impossible franchise. but this extravagantly entertaining Dolby soap opera nails what the Mission: Impossible franchise does best. **B+** \- David Ehrlich, indieWire

The action consistently snaps the film into focus, but it further illustrates how badly the decision to split this narrative into two parts throws off its delicate rhythm. **2.5/4** \- Jake Cole, Slant Magazine

Dead Reckoning Part One is an exhilarating blockbuster, distilling pure spectacle into a two-and-a-half hour feature. - Hoai-Tran Bui, Inverse

Oh, does Cruise get in his steps over the course of this film, finding new and exciting locations through which to run, which McQuarrie’s cameras capture with just enough of a wink to let the audience know that he *gets* it. **B** \- Liz Shannon Miller, Consequence

Moves at the speed of sound, with one outrageous, exhilarating set piece after the other. **8.8/10** \- Jordan Hoffman, The Messenger

Gives you your money’s worth in the gonzo visuals department. **8/10** \- Matt Singer, ScreenCrush

“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is just incredibly fun. It feels half its length and contains enough memorable action sequences for some entire franchises. **3.5/4** \- Brian Tallerico, RogerEbert.com
