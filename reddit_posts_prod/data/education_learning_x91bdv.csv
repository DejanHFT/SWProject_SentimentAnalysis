Where can I re-learn math from The very beginning?,MiserableAltAddict,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/x91bdv/where_can_i_relearn_math_from_the_very_beginning/,35,61,"I’ve never been good at math. I’m now a freshman and have algebra every single day. I tried to take a diagnostic and hyperventilated. I don’t know how to divide, I’m not good at multiplying large numbers, I don’t know how to calculate information on graphs or line graphs or anything. I don’t want to to let my teachers know that I can’t do algebra because they would know I cheated through my school years. Help please.

Edit: I completely forgot to mention I have been cyber schooled since kindergarten. There’s no face to face contact with my teacher because we have the choice of not using microphones and not using cameras in class. That’s why she couldn’t tell I was hyperventilating and why I didn’t learn math."
