"I think I know why beginner lifters, the ones that occupy MM/FF threads, don't respond well to and are never satisfied with answers like ""listen to your body when you need to stop"" or ""squat forms are different of most people so just see what is most comfortable for you"".",diamond_sourpatchkid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3evcwb/i_think_i_know_why_beginner_lifters_the_ones_that/,476,1918,"Its because we have no *idea* what is comfortable for our bodies. Most people here are not just lifting noobs, but absolute exercise and fitness idiots as well. (No body consciousness or awareness.) We've spent years not listening to our bodies ""You are full stop eating"", ""Stop with the doritos you need protein"", etc). So when we get responses to form questions, its very difficult and unhelpful to respond with ""listen to your body"" even though it is technically correct. 

I just felt like posting this because 4 months of lifting, 4 months of yoga, and 8 months of running, I am only *now* beginning to realize what that means. I DO know my body, I am actually capable of knowing what is comfortable for my safety as well as how far I can go to achieve my goals. 

Im glad I made it through that rough beginning patch where I over analyzed everything I did and asked the same questions over and over again in order to  get the same frustrated answers from people on here, and other websites. All this, without doing anything too horrible and injuring myself so I could never exercise properly again, cause it only takes a moment to get lazy.

Anyway, it was just a thought, coming from a newbie turning into an experienced newbie.


EDIT: I'm so glad this got a discussion going. I didn't exactly have advice to give or solutions to anything but the conversation and discussion has been great. Thanks guys."
