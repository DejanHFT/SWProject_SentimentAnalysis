How do you think AI generated content will affect learning?,savage_northener,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/wboq9f/how_do_you_think_ai_generated_content_will_affect/,0,1,"With the recent fascinating and equally scary content produced by Open AI, how do you think this tech will affect learning?

I'm not referring only as a support tool for learning, but also as a hurdle to evaluation.

I myself am a college student, and I'm fascinated by the idea of generating answers or arguments, for example, * because I'm amused by the possibility that some teachers will never suspect it and because it raises new problems about the ineffectiveness of traditional evaluation. This is a relatively unknown tech where I live.

I'm in the field of education myself, and it seems to me that if copy-paste from the web is already an issue, this will be an even bigger one. It is very likely the current software used against plagiarism will not catch it.

I am sure that if I ever teach in the future, I'll have to deal with this. And the whole field of education.

Also, what kind of reformulation in learning and evaluation would this need or lead to?

*Btw, not that I intend to cheat the system, but part of the system is exploitable and this is an interesting issue.

(I saw a thread not long ago about this, but didn't find it, and since there's few and old discussions about it I took the liberty of creating another one)"
