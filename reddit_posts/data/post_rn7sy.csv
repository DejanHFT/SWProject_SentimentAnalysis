How close are we to create totally artificial life forms?,aec10,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/rn7sy/how_close_are_we_to_create_totally_artificial/,12,3,"By totally artificial, I mean start with atoms (no molecules, aminoacids, etc.). Also, no living things or part of living things allowed (except for the humans involved in the process).

Basically, no using living or dead cells or viruses, everything has to be done 'from scratch'."
