To whoever on here recommended The Princess Bride,Ashamed_Scallion_126,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/oo8ffv/to_whoever_on_here_recommended_the_princess_bride/,154,2479,"Thank you so much. I haven’t been able to read much more than a chapter of a book for years because of depression and anxiety. I bought it when I saw your post and finished it the same night. 

Thank you so much for helping me find something I could read and remember how much I used to love reading. Thank you. 

I would highly recommend it. The characters are vivid and enjoyable, and I really enjoyed the book-within-a-book format. I was fooled for a little bit thinking that it was a genuine adaptation of an older book, by the fictional S.Morgenstern, and I really loved the little asides the author makes as if explaining his “edits”. My favourite scene was the Fire Swamp and the Snow Sand :)

Edit: some more detail about the book! Sorry mods"
