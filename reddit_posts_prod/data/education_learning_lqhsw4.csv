7 year old son with ASD - learning to read,RalphWaldoEmers0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/lqhsw4/7_year_old_son_with_asd_learning_to_read/,16,6,"Hi,

My son has ASD (sorry if my terminology is wrong here) and he’s having a hard time learning to read.

He loves stardew valley and I’m wondering if anyone knows of a game that is engaging that will teach him to read?

Also open to any other ideas!

Thanks"
