>Godzilla: King of the Monsters is not a good movie. In fact, it's a pretty terrible one. Don't shoot the messenger, Kaiju fans.

>On a visual level, nearly every single frame of Godzilla: King of the Monsters feels like a work of art, with many moments evoking the spirit of Frank Frazetta's artistic creations (especially during the scenes with King Ghidorah).

>The stupid film’s only problem, then, is when it tries to be smart. Like Gareth Edwards’ 2014 movie, Dougherty’s follow-up has set itself up to be in constant conflict with itself. Its only reason for being is to stage fights between Godzilla and his equally large enemies (including the pterodactyl-like Rodan and the three-headed dragonesque Ghidorah). Yet the film also wants to tell a deep and dark story about humanity’s tendency toward self-destruction, and there is a distinct sense that it feels above all this monster nonsense..

>If you go to these things to see cities flambéed and flattened, you won't leave disappointed. At the same time -- almost impressively -- director and co-screenwriter Michael Dougherty is savvy enough to make the human drama monster-shaped.

>Yes, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is ultimately a Saturday matinee writ large, but that’s nothing to sneeze fire at; countless big, expensive action movies fail at making their way into a viewer’s pleasure center, but this one knows exactly how to be, in the truest sense of the Word.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/28/godzilla-king-of-the-monsters-review?sf103370441=1)

>A fun exercise in giant monster madness that indulges in all the kaiju fights fans and even casual viewers could hope for. It looks amazing while also giving its human characters a chance to stay interesting amid all the battling beasties by providing them with some really cool tech -- and some great one-liners among the supporting players. Unfortunately, the film’s plot is needlessly confusing, and not all that smart at times, and the lead characters could’ve used a little more fleshing out

>Easily the most satisfying of his Hollywood-produced adventures and a respectable cousin to the long string of Japanese ones, the sequel to Gareth Edwards' admirably serious but dullish 2014 film is the first to suggest any promise for what Legendary is calling its ""MonsterVerse"" — a franchise in which the Japanese kaiju world meshes with that of Hollywood's favorite

>This is one franchise that doesn't feel fished out or exhausted or exhausting.The monsters, Toho studio classics redesigned but faithfully so, are pretty swell and monumentally destructive.

[indieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/05/godzilla-king-of-the-monsters-review-sequel-1202142427/)

>A sloppy, stitched-together offering with no sense of self.

[AV Club](https://film.avclub.com/the-kaiju-are-cool-but-the-rest-is-a-mess-in-the-supe-1835054747)

>Of course the monsters should be the stars of a Godzilla movie. But until blockbuster filmmaking goes entirely non-narrative, some attention should be paid to the rest of it as well.
