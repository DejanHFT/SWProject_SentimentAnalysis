Best strategy game for someone with my taste.,Klippenbergen,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10fxsx4/best_strategy_game_for_someone_with_my_taste/,15,1,"I am currently playing rimworld at the moment but im looking for a game with more planning and thinking, kind og like the escapists but i see almost noone playing it at this time. I have a planning and strategy itch i need to scratch. Since there are no other prison escape games out there i could try games with another goal aswell, as long as there is planning and thinking with a bit of fun involved. Any tips or recomendations? Have to be on steam."
