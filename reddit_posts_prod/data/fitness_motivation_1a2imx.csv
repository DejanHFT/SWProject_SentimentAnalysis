I started getting my act together after the love of my life left me. I used to look pretty good but as I went through college I got fat and lazy. I've only been lifting and eating right for a few months now but I feel incredible. I started off doing it for her but eventually realized I need to do it for myself. I want to see how far I can go, how hard I can push myself. "
