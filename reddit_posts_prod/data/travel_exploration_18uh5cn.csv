Is there a way to sort by price on Google Flights explore page?,GemataZaria,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18uh5cn/is_there_a_way_to_sort_by_price_on_google_flights/,3,0,"I've been using Google Flights for a year now and I absolutely love it. My only pet peeve is that I can't seem to be able to sort by price when on the explore page. There are so many filters to control, but this simple option isn't there. 

Is there a way to do it? Otherwise, are there other platforms that have that option? I moved away from skyscanner because the prices on the explore page and the actual prices were vastly different."
