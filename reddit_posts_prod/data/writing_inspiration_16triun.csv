Who's your inspiration when it comes to your narrative voice?,Zemrik,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/16triun/whos_your_inspiration_when_it_comes_to_your/,7,1,"We all have our own voice, but we have authors who influence us. My two authors which I draw (try to) my voice/style from are George RR Martin and Steven Erikson. If I'm troubled with one section of my current wip, or anything, I just read them. I also have my go-to chapters from them for whenever I need that immediate boost and inspiration, Martin's 'The Forsaken' and the last scene of the last chapter of Erikson's Toll the Hounds (Bainisk the true hero). When I read them I just feel like I can do it. 

So, what are yours?"
