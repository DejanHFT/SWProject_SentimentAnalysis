Product development cost,Soccer36Player,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/19a4rwp/product_development_cost/,4,1,"Hi, I am wondering if the product development costs for a product I'm working on sound right. I am new to entrepreneurship, and just trying to make sure I am not being scammed. In short, the product I am designing is an oversized dog gate/fence. 

Research/product design/ manufacturing CAD files: $9,621 including tax. Estimated duration: 14-21 days. 

Upon completion of verified designs/product renderings, second deposit of $4,810 is requested to begin prototyping. Estimated duration: 8-10 weeks from start to finish.

After reviewing manufacturing estimates, and prototype has been finished with video demo, final payment of $4,810.50 will be requested. 

They then will ship me the prototype/manufactured file and prepare to assist me with the manufacturing and market launch process.

Thanks in advance!"
