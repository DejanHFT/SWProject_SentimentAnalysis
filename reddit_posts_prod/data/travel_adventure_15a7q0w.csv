Looking for adventurous Central America recommendations for an active traveler,acarna23,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15a7q0w/looking_for_adventurous_central_america/,5,5,"TIA for your help! I’ll try to provide as much detail as possible.

I’m traveling to Costa Rica at the end of August for a 11 day dive trip but then planning to spend ~3 weeks somewhere in Central America during the month of September. I’ve done a lot of research for best places in September, to best hikes, to best diving spots, to towns with best culture/vibe. It’s a lot, and honestly it’s making my head spin. I would love to get some recs from all of you to help me narrow down the options! 

About me and what I’m after: I’m a super active person. I love climbing things, running in unique places, volcanos, wildlife (especially if I can volunteer at a research center or rehabilitation center), scuba diving (somewhere with sharks is preferable), and would be interested in things like mountain horseback riding or surfing. I’m not particularly interested in things like drinking, laying by the beach, or cities. 

I work remotely during the week so will need to have access to good wifi then but I’m fine to go off the grid on weekends.

I have one weekend in Costa Rica before my dive trip and would also love recs for somewhere to spend it that’s somewhat near to San Jose where I need to meet my group. 

Appreciate your help!"
