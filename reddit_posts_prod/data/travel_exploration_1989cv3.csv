Exploring Spirituality in Japan,Substantial_Sun_2089,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1989cv3/exploring_spirituality_in_japan/,6,0,"Hi all! I am traveling to Japan next month for two weeks. I will be going to Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo.
I teach and practice meditation and yoga in the States and know Japan has a very rich history with Buddhism, I am going to a few temples but would love some more suggestions, either potential meditations I could partake in, any store fronts that maybe sell insense or similar things or attractions I should check out.
I am open to suggestions! Would really love to explore this aspect of Japan more deeply. Thank you for your suggestions in advance!"
