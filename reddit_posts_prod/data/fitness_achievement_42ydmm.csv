"What are some achievable goals for the end of 2016, based on where I am right now?",RyanW1019,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/42ydmm/what_are_some_achievable_goals_for_the_end_of/,192,29,"Hi /r/Fitness.

2015 was the year I first got into fitness, and to be honest it could have gone a lot better. I did a standard brosplit for the first 6 months, injured my shoulder doing something stupid, and then had to take 3 full months off. Now it's 2016; I have a lot more knowledge than I did a year ago, and I'm hoping to do things right this year.

My stats are as follows: M/5'10""/22 y.o./166 lbs/~18% BF.

My current working weights are:

* Squat: 115 lbs x 3 x 5

* Deadlift: 165 lbs x 1 x 7

* Bench: 105 lbs x 5 x 5

* Rows: 90 lbs x 5 x 5

* OHP: 60 lbs x 5 x 5

* C25K: Week 1, Day 2

I've mostly gotten back to the numbers where I was before my injury, though I wasn't squatting or deadlifting before I hurt myself. Haven't tried to max anything out yet as I'm still working on getting my form down for the more technical lifts. My focus is on lifting, but I've also just started running, as I figured I shouldn't be neglecting cardio as I attempt to get stronger.

Based on where I am now, what are some SMART (Smart, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-based) goals for me? For 6 months from now? For the end of 2016? My goals are both strength and aesthetics, but I'm not afraid to bulk in the short term. I'm currently on the Beginner PPL routine linked in the wiki, and would like to stay on some sort of 6-day-a week routine for as long as I have the time to get in the gym that often.

The goals I have are as follows: 

* Squat: 200 pound max by June 1st, 300 pound max by December 31st.

* Deadlift: 250 pound max by June 1st, 400 pound max by December 31st. 

* Bench: 135 pound max by June 1st, 150 pound max by December 31st.

~~* Row: 115 pound max by June 1st, 135 pound max by December 31st.~~ (Apparently nobody maxes rows)

* OHP: 75 pound max by June 1st, 100 pound max by December 31st.

* Running: Run a 5K before April 1st, run a 10K before July 1st.

* BF%: Below 15% by June 1st

Are these goals realistic? Am I shooting too high or not high enough with any of these, and if so, what would be better goals to set? This is my first foray into fitness, so I don't know what a typical beginner should be able to do after a year of  consistent training.

Thank you very much for the help."
