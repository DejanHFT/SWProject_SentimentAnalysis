"Will I achieve anything with this ""Workout""?",V1T4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5di3xq/will_i_achieve_anything_with_this_workout/,9,0,"If this against the rules I'm sorry. Just tell me or delete this post. :)


First of all myself:
Age: 15
Height: 1.66cm approx. (5.44 feet)
Weight: 55.5 atm. (122lb) (end of the day) 


At the moment I'm doing 20x3 squats, 20x3 bankdips, 20x3 situps and 10x3 pushups at 35Â° (approx) because I'm too weak to do it at the ground. (moms spaghetti) [daily!] For me this whole ""Workout"" is extremely exhausting but I always end it clean and I'm really hard trying to do every exercise without to be sloppy.
I've also tried to change my Nutrition(?). I killed every candy and convenience foods(?) from my foodplan to do the first steps in eating less calories. Next week i wanted to go even further and suit my diet even more but I don't really now what I should eat and what not. I found various anwsers on the Internet but some of these are conflicting and It's just confusing. Don't allow me 
You shouldn't tell me I can eat everything if the calories I eat are less than I use because I'd allow every junk food for me and would get sloppy with the exercises. x'D (xD in 2016 I know)


I want to get atleast rid off my flab pad(?) and maybe be able to see my muscles. 
My purpose to do some sport and eat better is just aesthetic even I tell everyone I do this for my health. ^^


To sum it up.
My questions are: 
How should I eat because the diet is obviously pretty important especially for my age. 
Is my workout and diet worth it/effective? I mean will this get me anywhere?


You've spend your time on reading this or even anwsering this? I really appreciate this!
If you find mistakes of any kind just tell me and I'll do my best to correct them! :)


Have a nice morning/day/evening/night/whatever! :)"
