#Written Reviews

> That’s almost a metaphor for how Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse fits into the web of 2018 Spider-Media. In a wide field of Spider-Mans to choose from, it is the strength of Miles Morales’ story that makes him a standout character. And Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse has plenty of strengths to go around.

> With its risky visual storytelling and tender script, Into the Spider-Verse earns the greatest honor that one can bestow on a Spider-Man movie: It somehow makes you want to see more Spider-Man movies. Including at least a few more for Miles Morales alone.

> Spider-Verse not only returns Spider-Man to his comic-book roots, but reinstates that fundamental idea. In this telling of the story, it truly could be anyone behind that mask — a little girl, a grizzled detective, a middle-aged sad sack, maybe even another unassuming New York kid — and all the people wearing it are better together than they are apart.

> “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” represents some of the best superhero storytelling on the market. The frenetic animation and freewheeling story offer audiences a sense of boundless dynamism. It’s not the first time a director has attempted to incorporate comic book iconography into a feature-film adaptation — see also: Ang Lee’s “Hulk” and Edgar Wright’s “Scott Pilgrim vs. The World” — but it’s the most appealing. Watching “Into the Spider-Verse” evokes feelings of sitting cross-legged on the floor of your bedroom, eating cookies and immersing yourself in outrageous, mostly inviting new worlds.

[William Bibbiani - The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-film-review-animated-2018/)

> the brilliance of Sony’s snappy new animated “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” shows itself in the project’s uncanny ability to simultaneously reset and expand all that has come before, creating an inclusive world where pretty much anybody can be the superhero … even you!

[Peter Deburge - Variety](https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/film-review-spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-1203038468/) (Spoilers)

> There will almost certainly be more to be heard from this group of hipster crime fighters, who here have begun to carve out a fertile new neighborhood both in Brooklyn and the Marvel-Verse.

[Todd McCarthy - The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/spider-man-spider-verse-review-1164358?)


> Spider-Verse has plenty of small delights, and it looks unique. You walk away wondering what a Miles Morales adventure will look like when it’s doesn’t also have to be meditation on the cruciality of the Peter Parker monomyth. (I liked it more than Homecoming, and it sure as hell is better than the Amazing Spider-Mans.)

> But for a film that invites so much self-aware chortling over franchise in-jokery, you feel Spider-Verse has missed something essential from its own screen history. 

[Darren Frainch - Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movie-reviews/2018/11/28/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-review/?)

> It may seem a bit saccharine, typed out in so many words, but it's a message that superhero comics--that Spider-Man comics specifically--have been touting for ages, and something that's been long overdue for a big screen debut. It probably wouldn't work if Into The Spider-Verse weren't just so funny, self aware, and bleeding-edge modern--but it is, and it does. It manages to blow right past the dangers of sinking into after school special territory by believing wholeheartedly in its own message and delivering it with appropriately genuine stakes. The end result is an instant animated classic, and, with any luck, the first of many of its kind.

[Meg Downey - Gamespot

> Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is incredibly exciting because it eschews all of that. It’s innovative, irreverent, and dynamic. It’s hilarious but exceptionally earnest, with a lead character worth caring about. It’s the kind of cinematic ride that invites more franchise installments — not just to learn more about the many, many characters it introduces and worlds it hints at, but just to see how Miles Morales’ Spider-Man will grow and change.


[Brian Bishop - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18115201/spider-man-into-the-verse-movie-review-miles-morales)

> While on paper it might seem like a shameless cash grab, this latest take on the webslinger is a thrilling, witty and surprisingly necessary chapter in the franchise


[Charles Bramesco - The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/28/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-review-a-dazzling-animated-caper?)


> Tragic news for anyone who’s sick of superhero movies: “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” completely reinvigorates the genre, reaffirms why it’s resonating with a diverse modern audience that’s desperate to fight the power, and reiterates to us how these hyper-popular spandex myths are able to reinvent themselves on the fly whenever things get stale. Just when it seemed like “Infinity War” might be the culmination of a cultural phenomenon, that Stan Lee’s death could symbolize the end of an era, and that “Turn Off the Dark” was always going to be the silliest possible subtitle for a Spider-Man adaptation, along comes a delirious postmodern spectacle to remind us that these movies will exist for as long as people need to see themselves reflected in them. Sometimes, that can feel like a threat. Watching “Into the Spider-Verse,” it’s more like a promise.


[David Elrich - Indiewire](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/11/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-review-the-superhero-movie-we-need-1202023560/)

> Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse hits all the marks to be an all-around moviegoing blast. Miles Morales has a memorable big-screen debut thanks to a compelling story and strong performances from its heroes and villain. Alongside Peter Parker, Miles’ journey from everyday teenager to a genuine city-saving superhero is one of the best Spider-Man movie stories ever. The addition of other multiverse characters doesn’t overshadow Miles’ story, though Kingpin does get a bit shortchanged. Taking a bold departure from the Pixar animation style we’ve come to expect from mainstream animated films, Into the Spider-Verse delivers a dynamic visual experience unlike any other.

[David Griffin - IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/28/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-review)


> Ultimately, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse offers nearly two-hours of stunning and altogether captivating animation that's beautifully rendered to bring the superhero origin story of Miles Morales - and the Spider-Verse - to life in a never-before-seen manner. Although the threads left hanging for a potential sequel may be somewhat more fascinating than the fairly by-the-numbers origin story of Miles, the multiverse does provide a unique twist on Miles' coming-of-age hero tale from awkward teenager to self-confident superhero. Still, at the end of the day, Into the Spider-Verse is Miles' story and his first big-screen starring turn will undoubtedly leave viewers wanting more from this Spider-Man. So it's a good thing Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse sets up a sequel.

[Molly Freeman - Screenrant

> There are enough action-packed scenes and surprises to keep the “Avengers” movie crowd wowed, yet what makes “Spider-Verse” an essential entry in the superhero canon is the richness of its good guys. Little girls can see themselves in Gwen and Peni, out-of-shape dudes will get behind 40-something Peter’s hearty appetite and snarkiness, and Miles stands as the most universal of them all, a multicultural kid navigating self-confidence and identity issues with entertaining moxie.

> In Lee’s timeless words, with great power comes great responsibility – and also, in this case, a great Spider-Man adventure for everybody.


[Brian Tuitt - USA Today
](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/11/28/spider-man-spider-verse-review-2018-best-animated-film/2133819002/)


> On paper, the movie sounds entirely superfluous: It dreams up an entirely new storyline set in a parallel-universe New York and introduces an exhausting cross-dimensional cluster of Spidey-heroes. And to my chagrin, it’s terrific — a quick-witted entertainment, daring and familiar by turns, that also proves to be sweet, serious and irreverent in all the right doses.


[Justin Chang - LA Times
](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-review-20181128-story.html)

> This rousingly entertaining superhero adventure is everything a great family movie should be: laugh-out-loud funny, filled with teachable moments, and appealing to parents and kids of all ages. 

[Sandie Angulo Chen - Common Sense Media](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse)

> Sony knocked it out of the park with this one. It's the perfect movie to see with family over the winter holiday.
> Go for the seven different versions of Spider-Man and stay for the animation. It's trippy, beautiful and will make you want to go out and buy a comic book. You're probably going to want to see this one twice to try and soak in all of the Easter eggs.

[Kristen Acuna - Inside](https://www.thisisinsider.com/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-review-2018-11)


> That’s sort of what Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is about, but in the end it plays more like a celebration of both insane comics continuity and the mutable nature of superhero identification. Characters endlessly derived from a single superhero power-set can be hackneyed, but when the movie bands a bunch of those characters together with a lead Spidey of black and Latino heritage, it’s making a convincing case for how familiar superheroes can refresh themselves when new faces take up the mantle. For that matter, it makes a cleverly self-serving case for an animated spin-off of a much-adapted character. This is the seventh Spider-Man feature film in 16 years, but this universe has rarely felt so fresh. 

[Jesse Hassenger - The AV club](https://film.avclub.com/superhero-dimensions-collide-in-a-funny-gorgeously-psy-1830700647)

> Honestly, I love this movie and I love that it exists. I love that Sony took a risk on a (yes) somewhat complicated premise and turned it into something unique and funny and daring (and weird). I don’t always love the concept of “rooting” for movies to be financially successful, but I do hope Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse succeeds and sets off, not just a few more of these Miles Morales Spider-Man films, but also a whole plethora of studio-backed animated superhero films that can take real chances. This animated movie has more heart and emotion than most live actions films of this genre.
